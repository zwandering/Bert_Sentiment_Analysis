I have a white and black toy poodle that had terrible large brown eye stains and I tried a couple of different products, drops for food, liquid to wipe the stains with a cotton ball - nothing worked. I had heard about Angel Eyes before but did nothing. Then I talked to a groomer who told me about it, so I broke down and bought a bottle.

Best thing I ever did! Within a week I was seeing results and now after about 2 months, she has no real stain left. An occasional streak will come down from her eye, but I can wipe it right off. I'm told that if I continue to use the product, she will have no more stains.  However, you have to continue to use the product.  Finally - a product that actually does what it says it will!

Yes, this product does exactly what it says it does and it does it very well - better than any other i've tried...BUT it doesn't work as well on all fur types. I have one terrier mix with fluffy fur/hair and two pugs. The Furminator works wonders on the terrier mix, on my male pug it works okay and on my female pug it pulls nothing (perhaps someone can make a suggestion?). It is worth my expense only because completely deshedding just one dog helps.

This is my second time using TurboTax and found it even better than last year. It imported all necessary information from last year, then asked if I wanted to import information from my Quicken Home & Business file. I said yes, looked over the imported information and was very pleased. My taxes took no time to prepare. Thankfully I set up my Quicken to import into the proper fields. That is key.

I trained, soloed, and earned my pilot certificate in a Piper J-3Cub this past summer. If I had it to do over, I would have bought these pedals at the very start. Twisting the grip on a joystick is not the same as using your feet to drive a Cub on the ground, keeping the ball centered, or slipping to land! If you are a serious simmer or interested in realistic flight training you need these pedals!

This Capresso is great for the price.  My old grinder was loud and messy.  This one is quiet, easy to clean, and never leaves me with lots of fine coffee in my cup after using my Moka Espresso maker.  I've only had it for a month now, but it runs great and feels like a solid machine that will last long term.

This is my first leap into DSL and my own Wi-Fi.  I sat down and installed both, expecting a long, drawn-out "simple" installation.  Well, it worked immediately!  No problems at all accessing the internet from a Hard-wired old HP notebook, or from the Averatec or the Gateway notebooks elsewhere in the house.  If it works outa the box with no phone calls or internet searches, it has my  vote!

I thought I should just share with y'all that Luvs is manufactured by the same peeps that make Pampers Diapers. They consider them their "discount brand", lots of big name brands do that to keep the most amount of customers (in this case upper and middle class families) in their corner.
About LUVS diapers I can say nothing too bad - my daughter is 2 years now and VERY active and also drinks A LOT so we have quite a few leaky diapers throughout the day but I have to say I tried regular Pampers Cruisers, Huggies, Walmart Brand - she always has leaks, it just comes with the degree of activity and the amount of water she drinks all day. At night time I switched from Pampers Cruisers to Huggies Night Time Diapers; works really well for me, havent had any leaks in the middle of the night anymore. But during the day I stick to my LUVS, they are fairly cheap (only a couple of dollars difference from Pampers, but HEY) and do the job. I would like to comment on a couple of things some people here said (negative) about LUVS:
If the diaper is leaking, it COULD be the diaper, but most likely it's your little one; once they are more active, they wiggle and bend differently and what worked fine before, just doesnt work now any longer. Also, when they get in between sizes the diaper just doesnt do the job anymore, you need a bigger size. And maybe they just had a cup of water too many and you didnt realize it fast enough and there you have the leak.
If your kiddo has diaper rash, it could be the diaper, but most likely your child is already on the sensitive side - like mine - so what I did was I used a blow dryer every time I changed her diaper after I cleaned her up with wipes really good, and when her bottom was dry I used good ol' Vaseline (for babies) to keep the urin from entering the skin BTW Vaseline is what Pampers use inside of their Swaddlers and Cruisers, so there you have the secret ingredient to prevent rash in expensive diapers! Works really great! I only used Boudreauxs Butt Paste when she had a bad rash, to make it go away, other than that I ALWAYS used Vaseline, every single time I changed her.
If your little stretchy tab tears you really just got one out of the whole package that was faulty or you used to much force, it happened to me too, with Pampers Swaddlers and Cruisers also, but actually the worst was Huggies - they almost ALWAYS tore. I must be doing something wrong - my LUVS hold up for the most part.
Last I would like to say that I never let my Toddler run around the house in just diapers on - she knows how to take them off and if she is playing bouncy on her ride-on car sometimes the already full diaper explodes and the gelly stuff comes out. Stretchy pants or shorts really help with that.
With Huggies I've made only bad experiences when she was a baby - it seems like Huggies are perfect for boys, maybe it has something to do with the anatomy and how the pee comes out, but they NEVER worked for my daughter. I am really surprised that the over night diapers from Huggies are so great, just during the day they also leak - I really think it's a gender thing. Correct me if Im wrong.

Over all, really love LUVS, I prefer Pampers, just not the price, so I save a couple of bucks each month by buying LUVS. Im pregnant with baby no 2 right now and for newborns to about 9 months I am going to use Pampers Swaddler and Cruisers ONLY but thats ONLY because I breastfeed and Pampers absorb runny messes like no other diaper - but only Swaddlers and Cruisers - they have a net-like texture that absorbs the runny poop and keeps it in there better than any diaper I know.

For the everyday (during the day) wear with mostly pee to take care of, I absolutely recommend LUVS.

I looked at the different types of machines and came down to the Keurig with the kcups or a Bunn with the pods.  I use the pods at work and although cheaper and available more places, I like the kcups better - easiest cleanup.  You can order them online and have them delivered or go to several stores and find them.

This machine is great.  It has selectable cup sizes, it is very nice looking, it has a large water reservoir and it makes fast, excellent coffee.

This drive was a lot smaller than the picture made it look, and it's the fastest stick I've written to so far. The rubber coating makes it quite impact resistant, however the cap slides off too easily and bounces away. I've already had two sessions of scouring the floor trying to find it.

A previous reviewer complained that the 6 cup version only makes 1 1/4 cups. This is an espresso maker, as such, the cups are measured in "espresso cups", which happen to be 1oz or 30ml. So the 6 cup make 6oz, which is plenty of espresso to have anyone climbing the walls. I love mine, I have the 3 and 6 version (work and home).

I've probably had close to 10 toaster ovens over the years, looking for the perfect one.  This might be it.  Great aesthetics, intuitive controls, works extremely well, good price.  The only unknown is how long it'll last, but I'm hopeful, as my past experience with Cuisinart products has been good.  If you're in the market for a toaster oven, I can't recommend this one highly enough.

I finished this book within a matter of hours. I might not agree with every single thing Steve said in the book but there is definitely some great advice and male perspectives in this book. I think it's a great read for all women and even men.One thing I have a hard time accepting is that it seems like it's up to us as women to bear the brunt of responsibility to keep a man from straying while at the same time he says a man is going to do what he really wants to anyway when it's all said and done. It seems like he's saying it's in a mans nature to cheat but here's some things you can do on your end that MIGHT help him stay true.  Great book to discuss at a get together. I do plan on reading it again and dissecting some parts of it and I will blog about it too on myspace. GREAT JOB STEVE! VALUABLE INFORMATION - I'm PROUD OF YOU!

The Slingbox does what it says it will, and the remote ability is way beyond cool - totally amazing.  Honestly though, the picture is OK but not great when viewed in a reduced size box, but pixelates when viewed full screen.  I had hopes of getting output from my computer to a TV, but blowing it up to TV size would be pointless.

The Tivo-like ability to pause and replay is neat.

The Slingbox provides a nice ability to have when it is the only option for watching something I really want to watch, but it isn't a way I would choose to watch TV on a regular basis.

This razor is not a bad deal, even though its a bit pricey.   Its only really good for those "tender areas", since it would take waaayy too long to shave your entire body with it.  However it is by far the most comfortable product I've used.  I have had is no irritation even when going over the same area multiple times and it does a good job of getting rid of your hair.  It isn't perfect though, so after you use it you still may want to tidy up with a conventional razor if you have a hot date.

I love robust black coffee, and use my coffeemaker at least twice a day.  After burning through a Braun and a Krups a few years ago, I purchased this model three years ago after an exhaustive bit of research.  It's the best ever, and so good that I have recommended it to friends and family, and just purchased one as a thank you gift for a couple who were getting by with an ancient, dribbling  Mr. Coffee at their vacation home.  A tip for those who like their brew extra strong - press the 1-4 cups button to allow for slower water flow, thereby producing a stronger result without having to add additional coffee.  although it comes with the gold tone filter, I prefer the convenience of disposable paper filters ($1.60 for 100 at Trader Joe's).  Also, I'm not sure why other reviewers have complanied about difficulty filling the water receptacle.  Have never encountered any issues with this - simply use the carafe and pour.

Loved this movie.   I am not partial to super-hero movies, but watched this one after my kids (ages 14 and 12) watched it on their Air France flight and loved it themselves.   This is not your typical super hero movie, it's better.   Perhaps because the story of Iron Man as told in the comic books has more pragmatic beginnings, this movie is believable.  Excellent acting all around, excellent use of humor.  I've purchased it for gifts for my master stylist (who also loved it), and my brother (who turned me on to the 'bad' comic books like Iron Man and Batman when I was into the 'good' comics like Tweety and Slyvester).  I sure hope the ending suggests a sequel!

I am on a budget like everyone else this holiday season so when looking to purchase this mixer I searched long and hard over the net to find the best price. I bought it on December 4 from Appliances.com for two hundred eighteen dollars and ninety five cents plus twenty two dollars and sixty five cents for shipping for a total of two hundred forty one dollars and sixty cents. I found it today, Dec 8 on Amazon for one hundred ninety nine dollars and ninety nine cents. I have not recieved my mixer yet from Appliances.com. I called them and told them about Amazon's price and they said they do not honor  price matching and gave me the TOUGH LUCK attitude. I wish I would have paid more from Amazon initially because I know that they would have refunded the difference in price. In customer service, amazon is always great. My own choice to save eight dollars cost me forty one dollars and sixty one cents. Customer Service makes a big difference. Do not purchase anything from Appliances.com. They are not honorable. SO as far as me never spending my hard earned cash at Appliances.com , TOUGH LUCK!

This is the best thing that I bought for my baby and I should have registered for it.  I went the first six weeks without it and I found that my daughter, a great sleeper but also very active from birth, would get woken up when she would undo the swaddle we had put her to bed in.  A friend of mine got this from her registry and I went out and got it the minute I watched how easily she swaddled her son.  Using the SwaddleMe, I could swaddle her even when I was barely awake and it stayed put even with her constantly kicking legs.  She started sleeping through the night immediately.  I think she would have a lot sooner had she been able to stay swaddled all night.  I'm not making any promises that this will make your baby sleep through the night, but it is worth a try. I will buy this as a gift for every baby shower I ever attend I am so sold on this product.

It's amazing and I love it.  The battery life is four times any laptop I've ever owned.  Just to cycle the battery a couple times I had to run my virus scanner for 5 hours, after changing the power settings to "always on."  That's five hours of the hard drive spinning almost constantly.

I recommend you spend an extra $25 for a 2GB memory stick.  I've regretted not max-ing out memory on laptops in the past.  But I've never regretted spending a few extra bucks to max them out up-front.

Obviously, this is the perfect airplane companion.  Even if it's your second laptop, for the airplane only, it's well worth the $350 if you travel a lot.  You don't even have to worry if the person in front of you puts the seat back--it still fits.  And you certainly don't have to worry about the battery life.

The keyboard is NOT a problem.  I'm 6 feet tall with large hands.  After reading these reviews I thought it would be an issue.  I just plunked down my hands and started typing, and it was fine!  That leaves only the tiny screen size as the only thing less-than-ideal, but you know what you are getting -- it's a netbook, not a laptop.

Performance is snappy -- It seems to be better than my 2.4Ghz Celeron laptop.  The thing preventing lots of multi-tasking is the screen, not the CPU.  If you are at home, you might consider an external monitor.

Here's a tip for would-be buyers.  If you don't want to spend money for a USB CD drive, just download "Alcohol 52 Free Edition".  It allows you to rip installation CDs and DVDs to image files, and to mount those files into a "virtual" drive.  Just transfer the image files onto this baby using a thumb drive or over the network.  Of course, some installations are not particular about running from a CD, and you can just install by copying all the files to a thumb drive.  I use my thumb drives for other things, though, and it's more convenient to move 2 files across to get the whole CD, and then be able to easily clean it up after.

The first thing you'll want to do when you get this machine is uninstall all the trial software.  That's pretty quick -- maybe 20 minutes.  The second thing is adjust the touchpad sensitivity and speed in the control panel under "mouse".  

If I can figure out how to get it to boot up with the WiFi disabled, I'll be 100% happy about it (instead of 99.9).  I checked the BIOS, and didn't see anything there.  Of course, flicking the button once is not much of a big deal.

I felt like everyone who had an extremely easy time installing, didn't have my luck.  For the first 3-4 times I tried to run the setup CD, it didn't realize that I already was connected to a router and was replacing the old router with this unit.  That was frustrating.  When it finally realized that was the case, the installation, setup, and securing were easy.  It couldn't find my internet connection but once I unplugged and re-plugged the router and modem as the included FAQ sheet stated it worked great.  Plugged in the new password and I was on.  The signal appeared weak at the start but quickly updated to full strength.  Working great so far, great value for the $.  Happy to replace my old dying router with a new one.

I bought the 500GB desktop version of the drive. From the site, there are 3 versions of the consumer simple drive, the Simple drive mini, the simple drive portable, and the desk top version. Both the Mini and portable versions do not require a separate power supply to power it, but apparently the portable does provide a jack in the back for one if you choose. The desktop version does come with a wall wart power supply as it's required for it to operate, unlike the portable/mini drives has a faster spindle speed (7200, vs 5400RPM), which may explain why the required power supply.

I've had this thing now a bit over a month and I use mine as a secondary drive for all media related files, photos, audio and video, not archiving, but for editing and the like. I have also transfered the backup software to CD and reformatted the drive into 3 partitions, 2 as 166GB, the third as 140 or so GB. 

So far, it works great as both a drive for editing audio files, but for video too. At 480MPS, it's plenty fast enough through USB 2.0. There is a version that allows for Firewire use, but only at 400MPS. Mine is the basic USB version. In the month or so I've had it, it's started up just fine, is recognized by Windows XP just fine and has so far not been a problem. The internal drive may well be made by Western Digital and I have 2 of their older Caviars inside my machine and both have given me faithful service for at least 4 years now. I have not looked at the instructions on the CD yet, so far hadn't needed to either but have kept the disk, just in case though.

In my search of externals, I looked at the WD My Book, it's smaller Passport, the Seagate Free Agent Pro, the Maxtor One Touch, HItachi and La Cie, some manufactures, namely the La Cie didn't even offer anything over 320MB capacities, others did, but I found too many issues, namely design issues with the enclosures, the drive to USB interface, or the cable to be legion on some manufacturers, even customer service seems lacking and over the long run, the Simple Tech offered what I needed, a basic external drive, reasonably fast read/write speeds, 7200RPM, Vs 5400RPM spindle speeds, reliability, capacity and at a decent price and it seemed to have fit the bill quite nicely and does very well so far.

The desktop version have the blue LED ring that indicates the rough estimate of the usage of the drive itself in quarter increments, this same ring also rotates sequentially to indicate read/write activity. Since I have 3 partitions on mine, they get recognized individually upon turn on, which is cool.

Overall, I love this drive and it's performance and it definitely does what I need it to do. 

Now, all that said, even the Simple Tech had it's issues with clunkers, which will be a given for any electronic device, but the issues seem very few in comparisons to some of the other manufacturers.

If I had to buy another one right now, I'd by exactly what I have, but perhaps in a smaller size for archival purposes only.

One of my cardinal rules for setting up input peripherals is: "Install it, then download drivers off the web".  If you do this, the mouse will install perfectly.  My advice is ignore MS's paranoid warnings about installing software first, because the mouse will work regardless.  Use Windows Update and the drivers will update to what's unnecessary for you.

In terms of the form factor of the mouse, it feels very natural in my hand.  The on the fly resolution switching is a little funky, and of little use in a real-world sense, but it's certainly handy in gaming and graphics situations.  The buttons click firmly and loudly for solid feedback.  The rubberized surface of the mouse also feels very nice.  One problem I ran into with my Logitech mice is dirt collecting on the surface for a lovely grime that collects over time.  I'll see how this mouse handles multiple grubby hands over time.  

My -1 star is for the deceptive image for the mouse.  The blue light around the rim is not as clean and consistent as the marketing photo would have you believe. It is actually broken up quite regularly by the plastic clips that hold the mouse together, and therefore make a spotty line.  It looks a bit cheap.  

Thumbs up from me for this mouse, I highly recommend it (from a longtime Logitech user).

I really like this product. We replaced our George Foreman grill with this unit and we haven't looked back since. We have grilled everything from burgers, to steaks, tilapia and tuna steaks, chicken and pork. It all grilled very well. We have also done panini's and breakfast on this unit. I did read where some folks were having a hard time with splatter but we have not experienced this with any of our meats. 

The drains are located in excellent spots and work very well.

The quickness with which this grill cooks the food is amazing as well. Burgers are done within 6-8 min and everything works according to plan. When we had a party I thought it might be kind of small but we opened it up and cooked all the burgers that way. We were able to effectively cook 6 burgers at a time. 

Clean up is a breeze thanks to the removable plates on this thing which come off easily with just a click of a button. They clean right up with the tool provided and a scrub brush. Then they just pop right back in when ready to use. We have run them through several cycles in the dishwasher and they still have their non-stick surface so it appears they are holdng up well. The only complaint I might have would be cleaning the top plate. Because the plate rotates to allow for thick foods to cook evenly on top and bottom, the cleaning process gets a little hairy when you try to clean the top plate and it rotates pushing all the gunk onto the counter. However, this is simply remedied by holding the top of the plate when cleaning.

Overall we give this product a A+. It works like it says it will and does many things well.

I'm a full-time working mother of a toddler, and I don't have more than 30 minutes a day to work out since I have to work out in the morning before she's awake.  I've been searching for a video that could get the job done in 30 minutes or less, and this is that video.  I get just as much or more out of this video as I do in other videos that are 45 minutes to an hour.  There are 3 different levels: intermediate, intermediate/advanced, and advanced.  Each level has three circuits consisting of 3 minutes of strength training, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of abs.  I like how the different intervals keep you moving and your heart rate up.  I'm a Biggest Loser fan and have worked out to other videos of Jillian.  She can be very tough and agressive.  In this video, she's a lot more calm and right to the point in her instruction.  A nice feature on this DVD is when you get more advanced and learn the routine, you can play the workout with music only and no instruction.  Other posts have questioned whether you're to do it every day.  The recommendation at the beginning of the DVD is to do it every day; however, it's less than 30 minutes, so it shouldn't be that hard to squeeze it in each day.

Features I like that my old machine didn't have:  Will automatically run through 3 consecutive readings.  You set the time delay interval between them.  Then it displays the average of the three and stores it in memory.  Will record and keep separate the morning readings (4am to 10am) and/or the evening readings (7pm to 10pm).  Not sure about afternoon readings.  The gap is from 10am to 7pm, a common period for us retired folks to be taking our B/P.  Seems curious.  Nonetheless, a great gadget!

My previous blender was a Back to Basics Smoothie Elite, which was admittedly a good blender while it lasted. The drive shaft that rotates the blades seized into the plastic on fathers day. Disappointed and without a blender for the summer, I needed to find a replacement.

As a college student living by myself in an apartment, I have limited spending power. I picked up a Black and Decker at Wal-Mart for $35 initially. To be quite honest, it was a terrible blender. Ice cubes did not blend and crush properly like my Back to Basics, and the blade assembly already had warning signs of a lemon. That's where Amazon came into the picture, and I saw reviews echoing my sentiments. The blender was returned.

Enter the Hamilton Beach Personal Blender, astonishingly priced at $15. I was hesitant, like most everyone else reviewing this appliance. The reviews seemed good and the price point was perfect, so I figured I had nothing to loose. Thankfully, I was right- A month later, and the blender works just fine, and is capable of doing absolutely everything my larger blenders did (within reason, and in smaller portions).

Don't be hard on this blender and I am sure it will last you a long time. Sticking things in to stir, while I do it myself, is not recommended, especially if the blender is on. That is my only real complaint, after all: Sometimes, when using heavy ingredients for smoothies, I will have to stir once or twice. This was no different in the Black and Decker and the Smoothie Elite, which came with a stir stick. Cleaning is completely painless.

In closing, this is a great blender for those of you on a budget, in a single room apartment or in a college dormitory. I wouldn't expect it to last for 6 months, but I wouldn't expect that of any full sized blender either.

4.5 / 5, Rounded up for Amazon's scoring system.

My wife and I love this machine. If we get 2-3 years from the machine we will be happy. It is far and above any other machine for the features versus price. It boils down to value. We are well pleased. Those having trouble with temp are not assuring the products and machine are well chilled. We can make 2 batches of ice cream per sitting as we chill everything very cold. If you expect this machine to take room temperature product and chill it like a freezer, hey your expecting the machine to do exactly what the machine is not designed to do. I was going to get the larger stainless unit, and next time will but for now this is a great machine. We would have bought the other unit if the reviews were a little more realistic about the machine. So let me repeat, if you chill everything before prep, you can even make 2 batches per sitting.

I think this thing is great.  I used to have a Braun one that was similar until it broke because of the hinge to change from beard to mustache trimming.  This has interchangeable heads so that wont be an issue.  The turbo is a little louder than regular, but I don't think its that bad.  I don't shave everyday, so when I do there is a lot of hair.  The reservoir that the vacuum goes to is a bit small but as people have said, even if it doesn't get all the hair, it still makes the cleanup easier.  Highly reccomended.

I love it! I love it! I have loaded my favorite albums, a couple of feature films, a bunch of Youtube clips and plenty of photographs and I still have room left.  I showed it to my wife, and she wants one.  But I told her that we never seem to use it at the same time, so we'll share it.  I loaded all of her favorite meditation music and some Youtube yoga videos on a 2 GB SD card and she is as happy as can be.  I have shown my Zen to five people and three went out and bought one.

I received the Fuze for Christmas and I couldn't be more thrilled with it!  The screen is incredible for its size and I love the ability to quickly convert files to a format that can be viewed on the fuze.  I use Windows Media Center to record TV shows and movies and I was able to convert an entire 1 hour show in about 2 minutes and then watch it while on a trip just after Christmas.  One thing I was concerned about was how difficult the synchronization would be as my previous MP3 player required the opening of a couple of Explore windows and manually transferring files.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that it makes good use of Windows Media Player and the "drag and drop" process.  Lastly, the audio quality it delivers is unbeatable.  I was considering purchasing an iPod nano, but after getting the Fuze, I've dropped those plans.  If you want an easy

Over the past 50 years and having many dogs as pets, I have gone through many gates. Having 3 dogs right now, this gate has been the best (especially when my children visit with their 3 dogs).  The small puppies cannot get through and the larger dogs cannot get over.  The extensions are great because you can block a wider area (such as my hallway). So much better than the wooden ones that my puppies have gnawed and chewed on.  My children were so impressed with the gate that they will purchase one for their homes. Five stars for this one!

I saw (and heard) a Marpac SleepMate in my doctor's waiting room. It not only contributed to a soothing atmosphere, but pleasantly masked most of the conversations in the room.  After ordering one and using it for a few months I am even more impressed.  We have a noisy highway and train crossing about a block from the back of our home.  I'm a very light sleeper and no matter what sound machine we tried, the traffic noise and train whistles kept me up at night.  But the Marpac eliminates those disturbing outdoor noises, so I don't notice them.  The sound it makes reminds me of a large box fan, but without the excessive energy consumption and powerful breeze those fans produce.  I couldn't be happier with my Marpac. I hope it lasts a long time.

I read a lot of bad opinions about this drive, all of them after I confirmed my purchase :-( . Anyway, the drive is performing really well. The main problem I read about was the "double USB connector": I tested the drive in 3 PCs and none of them needed the extra power of the second USB connector, being enough with only one.
The only two things for withdrawing a star are the micro-USB connector in the drive being in the same side of the activity led, so I can not see the led when I connect the drive through one of the rear USB ports in my PC, and because the Retrospect software is very, very bad.

The first four episodes are amongst the best ever done for TV , the episodes taking place while the search for the Eye of Jupiter goes on makes you think ' well ... can't get better than this ' - but it does, for the last quarter of the season is simply awesome.

During the past 15 years I have made hundreds of loaves of bread (I make bread every other day)  in my old Zojirushi, so when it died, I checked reviews, and purchased another.  

My old Zojirushi was a vertical with one blade, 1 ? lb. capacity, one programmable memory option, large round view window, and a cool-down fan. This new one is horizontal, makes up to 2 lb. loaves, has 3 programmable memory options, narrow rectangular window, and a warm cycle instead of the cool down. 

Pros & Cons: 

This horizontal machine takes up twice the counter space of my old vertical machine, which is not a problem for me. But for my apartment friend who has only 4' of counter space, this 17" long machine takes up over 1/3 her counter space. She doesn't have cupboard space to store it, even if she could frequently manhandle the weight. 

Because it is heavy it never wobbles or walks. 

This boxy machine is ok, but esthetically I prefer the looks of the rounded top of the discontinued BBCC-V20 that was prior to this one. 

The twin blades allow bigger loaves but they come with problems. In my old maker, the loaves never stuck. Now every loaf is a difficult extrication, even with spatulas, unless I remember to wipe the blade posts, the pan bottom under the blades, and the blades with oil. Also, the two blades leave 2 big holes in the bottom of the bread. 

The reason I give Zojirushi only 4 stars, is because left to itself, this machine always bakes a lop-sided loaf. The manual sort of addresses this issue: "... the kneading blade turns the dough upside down, leaving an uneven surface on the top. This happens occasionally." No Zojirushi, this happens every time! The left side always cooks higher than the right, by sometimes as much as an inch. This is because the dough ball is always pushed farther to the left side by the right-hand blade. After baking 30 loaves, with the right side never once filling the pan evenly, I devised a solution. If I want an even-topped loaf, I am chained to day-time cooking and wearing a timer around my neck, so after the last stir down between the 2nd & 3rd rise (less than a minute long), I can immediately remove the bread, hand shape it and return it to the machine.  (When the bread is out of the pan, remove the blades for easy release the finished loaf, sans two large blade holes.) Two-pound loaves are less of a problem than smaller ones that sometimes fall off to the right as much as 1-1/2". But this means I should revise (what a pain) all of my old, smaller recipes. For these reasons, I prefer a vertical machine with a much smaller bottom surface area (approx. 4-1/2" sq.), so that the dough ball is always centered and I have freedom. 

I often add ingredients (nuts, chips, etc.) at the Add-Beep near the end of kneading, but frequently I just miss it, or arrive late in the beeping. For this, I especially love the programmable memory that allows me to cancel the process, add my late ingredients, and then press the memory, which I programmed to knead a few more minutes before continuing the rest of the cycle. I wish however, there were more than the limited, 3-saved processes. Some of my breads are very specific for different rising, kneading, and baking times and so would enjoy additional memory space and the ability to name my saved cycles instead of Memory 1, 2, or 3. 

In fifteen years there have been many improvements. Not enough however, to replace an old, still-working workhorse, just to get a new machine. If you can, wait until major improvements are made such as (hopefully) retractable blades, interior lighting, increased programmable memory, and dough left centrally placed in the rising cycle for even tops. 

If you have to get a new machine, and a horizontal presentation is important to you, then I do recommend this Zojirushi. Despite my criticisms, it is still a quality machine.  I place the Breadman a close second.

I love this kettle.  It's replacing a beloved Russell Hobbes and I'm pleased with its well thought-out design and quick boiling time.  

However, there was an overwhelming 'plastic' taste/ smell even after cleaning thoroughly.  As best I can tell it is due to the rubbery/ plastic seal on the lid.  

To remedy, I had to run though several cycles, including cycles with vinegar and baking soda (separately, of course) added to the water.  It seems to have fixed the problem but it is something that new owners should be aware of.

This video is an amazing compliment to their first, "First Signs."   I would highly recommend them both.  My daughter started watching "First Signs" when she was 3 months old.  Watching it captivated her.  At around 6 months she started getting really excited whenever I would get the DVD out.  At around 10 months she started signing!  When this DVD, "Sharing Signs" came out I purchases it immediately.  She loves this one just as much, and is able to sign most of the signs.  Through the sign language that she learned on these DVDs Tayah is able to communicate her needs.  It is amazing that she can sign help when she needs it rather than fuss and cry.

The use of a Water Pik had been suggested to me after having a not so good moment at the dentist on my last visit. I wear braces, both top and bottom and I had been flossing however it seemed to take too long and it was not enough to get the job done right. I had purchased the water pick after looking at numerous other similar products and am glad I decided to go for the Pik. After having used it for a week I noticed that my problem areas had diminished because I was able to clean out the pockets between the teeth more efficiently than flossing.  In fact it seemed to work just as well as getting a cleaning from the dentist. Considering the price, I am glad I paid the $40. It was a good investment. It takes some getting used to if you never have used one before, however it does not take too long to learn how to effectively maneuver the pick. As for deciding size of the reservoir, I am glad I decided to get the water pik with the highest water capacity. I find that the water is generously put out by the pick and I have to refill the reservoir 3-4 times each time I use it.

This review is from: Gone with the Wind (Four-Disc Collector's Edition) 1939 (DVD)

      



I must admit, I was skeptical about Gone with Wind.  It is such an iconic movie.  Afterall, I'm familiar with many scenes, outgrowths that seem to possess lives of their own, like snatches of famous poems, or passages of well-known music.  But watched it I did, one Saturday evening, and I was pleasantly surprised.  First of all, it is beautiful and there are passing nods to the cruelties of slavery, war, being a woman, the southern condition, hunger etc. but you already know that there are other superior treatments of these subjects elsewhere.  The romantic core of the movie involves the m閚age a trois of Gable, Leigh and Howard as they manipulate and deceive themselves and each other in the name of love over a span of many years.  "We live on love" as they say.  The gestures are grand, over-the-top and the characters mythic, made for the wide-screen. It is in the end, a film begging to be an opera.  Under this fancy, Rhet would be a baritone, Scarlett, a soprano and Ashley a tenor with a mezza-soprano playing the self-sacrificing Melly.  Once you've superimposed the structure of opera on Gone with the Wind, it fulfills on a different level. Selznick himself seemed to have planted this allusion in the movie by slipping in the mysterious Overtures and Intermission scenes. Next time you watch or rewatch this film, bring your virtual opera glasses,  "...tomorrow is another day" - indeed.

Season 1 is actually my favorite season of BSG, and that's saying a lot. It is one of the best written shows on television right now, the plot is gripping, and the chcracters are much grittier and more realistic than on many other utopian sci-fi shows. I have seen it dubbed "The Sci-fi series for people who hate sci-fi" by at least one critic.

The show is not affraid to examine many contemporary issues in the guise of fiction, and it shies away from easy answers. Although there are villians and antagonists throughout, one of the most endearing features of the show is the way these roles can change and shift over time. There are certainly times when the viewer is not sure who is right and who they want to win. There are no classic heroes or villians, although characteristics of both are certainly present in abundance in some characters. It's this dystopian view that keeps the viewer engaged and enthralled, and always wanting more.

We ordered this item the same day my wife discovered it being used in her doctor's office.  It's a real winner.  For those who have been struggling with pump-up devices, relying on those machines at the pharmacist's counter or in your health club, and/or encountering inconsistent, confusing BP readings, your search is over.  This little guy goes on your wrist in seconds and stays secure with a velcro fastener.  If you set it the way we prefer, you simply move your forearm slowly up your chest until you hear the beep indicating proper positioning relative to the heart, then hold still and wait a few seconds more while it does its work.  Our only complaint, and the only thing holding us back from five star rating, is some occasional reluctance to get to that heart location position as quickly as we might like.  Finally, this model has all the extra functions we would ever need (memory function, logo reminders, etc.); the next model up seems like overkill, and the one below lacks what really are some fun and helpful features.

I actually don't know where to begin with how this book has changed my life in terms of simplifying it.  A friend introduced it to me because I was becoming quite agitated because of all the "stuff" that I constantly had looming over my head.  If you're like me and like putting things into "frameworks", this system will work well for you because it essentially provides you with a way to organize your life in some fairly simple steps.  I won't try to summarize the book but basically it creates a framework with which you can organize all the paperwork, correspondence, etc. that comes into your life.  If you've tried other techniques, I would definitely give this one a try.

I have been using this brewer about 1 month now.  

There are lots of options that can be programmed.  My favorite is the ability to turn the machine on at a predetermined time in the morning (I chose 5AM) so the water is hot and ready to go.  Then I have it set to turn itself off 3 hours after the last cup has been brewed.  Even if it is off, you can turn it on at any time and be ready to brew in a few minutes - it even remembers to turn itself off 3 hours later.

There is some vibration as the brewer fills the cup and then again as the brewer refills itself after brewing.  It only lasts 10 seconds or so and is not annoying at all.  The noise is sort of on the level of an electric can opener.

The coffee maker fits perfectly on the counter under the cabinet above even when completely open.  The water reservoir is easy to fill.  The coffee maker is nicely designed and looks amazing sitting there on the counter.

I got this because I find the regular full-size laptop too heavy to lug around (and inconvenient at airport security). Plus it has Windows XP (I wanted to avoid Vista). I disabled most of the accompanying software (too much of this for my taste), so it boots up very fast. (It came with Microsoft Office, but the free-trial runs out after 60 days, so I just loaded OpenOffice). The keyboard is small but manageable, and my hands are quite big. The space bar is above the scratch-pad-mouse thing, which is not where I'm used to, but I got accustomed to it quite quickly. It is a little inconvenient to use ctrl-shift-end, because you actually have to press three keys on the left plus the End key (some keys have two functions depending on whether you hold down the Fn key), but that's no big deal. The mouse-pad thing is very sensitive, so sometimes I click or drag things by mistake, which can be a pain. The actual click buttons on the left and right of the pad are quite hard to click and hold down, which can also be annoying (for instance, if you want to drag).
The glossy cover does collect oil from my hands, rather like having a pair of glasses that need to be cleaned frequently.
It doesn't have a CD-ROM drive, which could potentially be a negative if you need to load software, but I got a 2MB memory stick for the USB and so can transfer files from my desktop very easily.
It is very light and portable, you can just stick it in your briefcase no problem. I don't care that the screen is small, it still looks good. I don't do a lot of surfing on it, but I have watched youtube clips without a problem. I only get a "low" or "very low" signal strength on my home wireless network (vs stronger measures on a regular laptop), but so far it hasn't been a problem.
I got the 3-cell model, and the battery runs probably three hours.
Overall, at $375 for the 3-cell model, I think it's a really good deal.

The Acer Aspire One Netbook is a terrific little PC because it not only works with the internet but has the ability to run Microsoft Office Applications, Audio and Video and when you add an external CD/DVD drive to it you can load ptograms to it.  It is a rugged and lightweight and makes great travelling companion.
Suggest getting a leather case for it with an outside pocket to carry the power supply and cord.  Took it on several trips and connected to the Internet with no issues.  This is a great little system because of the full keyboard.  Suggest adding a wireless mouse to make it easy to navigate but the touchpad works with a little practice.

I tried Hyrdroxycut Hardcore during my last cutting phase and it worked. I started taking it when I was at 5% body fat and I cut down to about 3% after a month of working out and taking the supplement six days a week. Most importantly, I was on an every day low carb, high fat and protein diet that I feel allowed the Hydroxycut to work its magic. I did chisel out more than I ever have before but I'm sure that the Hydroxycut wouldn't have worked so well without the diet. I wouldn't expect it to work unless you are exercising and dieting correctly. Also, I couldn't imagine taking it daily for over a month because after a month, my body and mind had grown quite weary of the stimulation. I started to not feel the "rush" any longer. I have tried other thermogenics and Hydroxycut definitely didn't provoke the euphoric feeling that I have experienced with some.  It was more of a jittery sensation with heightened senses instead of the calm, relaxed and mellow euphoria that I have enjoyed in the past with other caffeine based products. At times, when I was too hopped up on Hydroxycut, I would feel faint or weak during a workout, which is always disappointing. One aspect that some of you could enjoy is that this product drastically decreased my appetite. I could literally start to feel hungry, take a couple pills and suppress the urge for a few hours. So in conclusion, Hydroxycut works. It boosts energy, suppresses appetite, and allows you to burn more calories. However, you need exercise and a good diet plan for it to truly work.  Also, be careful of the dosage and quit taking it when your body gets use to it. As with any diet - drink a ton of water, although I don't need to tell you that because your body will.

Fully performs as advertised.  VISTA compatible download of upgraded PC software was straightforward.  Cuff is comfortable and well designed to place on oneself.

Diastolic readings were consistently inaccurate when compared to doctor's office, over a period of four weeks monitoring 4 times a day. The readings were 8 to 10 points less than actual. But the doctor also confirmed that OMRON is the best brand in the market, and possibly I was unlucky in getting a "bad" piece...unless [...] is selling seconds! Please advise immediately how to get a FREE replacement product of the same model.

I bought this flash drive because it has a good size for photo storage on the go and you don't have your laptop handy. I like it because it is well protected so the USB part is not easy to break when you are traveling. The only but I found is that it doesn't come with a strap, so it makes it difficult to carry when you don't have a bag.

My dogs look 100% better and they probably feel better about themselves too - wouldn't you?

I just received this toothbrush 2 weeks and I'm using it once a day.   It's a novel experience and yes, I am not having any trouble adjusting to it.
The majority of people in the reviews appear to adore it.   That's why I ordered it.   I've always used ten dollar electic brushes and they seemed satisfactory.   I was intrigued by the idea of something newer and better.   Basically, my teeth feel a little different and clean BUT I am not finding/feeling that fresh feeling after having brushed my teeth.   I am wondering whether to combine my old brush to one day and use this one on the second day.    Or do I always need mouthwash or something else to address the breath problem?    If anyone has any suggestions, I'd appreciate it.     I don't hate it but I'm not lovin' it.

I purchased this switch as part of my home network expansion/rationalization after a basement remodel. I redid my ethernet system, as well as my wireless system. I'm running a mixed wired/wireless system with a DSL internet connection (I have only DSL, satellite, or phone modem as options here). My DSL router is wired to my wireless router, which is in turn wired to the switch. The switch connects in 2 desktops, as well as 2 satellite TV DVRs, my stereo receiver (I know, overkill), and an Apple TV. The system runs seamlessly, whether I'm running my wired desktops or my laptop. All of the wired systems connect to the printer wirelessly and without a problem. The switch was simply plug and play. I have had no network issues in approximately 6 weeks of use. I am very happy with this product, as it does exactly what it says it does at a very reasonable price point.

I heard the hype but I still refused to get too excited. Then I saw it! WOW! The film is amazing on every level. Heath Ledger took a well known and often played character and made it his own. This is not your dad's Joker...this is the Joker that terrorized us in The Dark Knight Returns and the Killing Joke (2 of the finest Batman graphic novels) and he elevated it. The hero is only as good as his villain and this movie delivered. See it! All of you! Even if you don't like comic books or superhero movies!

I received this just three days after ordering from Etronics. It came well packed and looks just great. After reading the instructions, which looked daunting at first but proved quite easy, we made ourselves a couple of cups of very tasty coffee. I find that the 'medium' setting for the warmth of the coffee is fine if you want to drink it right away. I programmed it to start brewing for 5:50am this morning and pressed the 1-4 cup setting and voila, it was waiting for me, perfectly brewed. I can't help but wonder if the little 'dohicky' that hangs down and touches the middle of the carafe to stop the flow of coffee mid brew, will hold up, but time will tell. For now, I have no problem recommending this fine maker to anyone. Marcia

Here is a short and simple review:  
It does everything it supposed to do very well.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the earbuds are a joke.  My new earbuds actually allow the basic sound within the ipod to sound amazing.  So Apple did a really good job with the sound inside the ipod, they just provide very low quality earbuds.  I purchased my ipod at the Apple store and the customer service was amazing and very fast to check out.  I take my ipod everywhere with me.  This is my first ipod and I think it is great little, slim player and the coverflow is so cool.  The scroll wheel is very easy to use.  I had no problem using itunes.  I like itunes better than the windows media.  Syncing music to my ipod is easy and fast.

Don't waste your money buying something more expensive thinking it will

150 feet apart.  If I had to find any complaint, it would be that there doesn't seem to be a way to save your encryption string if you use WEP but, the more I use it, I actually think that even this may be a plus, kind of like having to enter your password every time you log on.

I installed the router last night and I finally have full coverage throughout the entire house (both floors) with NO dropped signals.  I use a PC laptop for work in the most remote part of the house and I now have 5 out of 5 bars and it has stayed connected continuously for almost 20 hours now.  It used to drop the signal every hour or so and I'd have to reconnect.  We have the following also accessing the router with no problems:  17" iMac, Powerbook, (2) MacBooks, (2) MacMinis, Xbox and a PS3.  The router's performance has exceeded my expectations!
Update:  I forgot to mention that I have not had the heat issue that others have mentioned.  Mine is barely warm to the touch.

I have had my Creative Zen for about 2 weeks now. I have found it to be a well designed mp3 player that has a lot of nice features and only a few setbacks.
The Pros: Great audio quality, small, compact design, amazing display, utilization of expandable memory via an SD card, radio and recorded voice options, ability to play mp4 (itunes) files.
Cons: Tends to freeze up, lack of quality peripherals, recessed grooves around all buttons are virtual dust resevoirs, "so-so" media organizer, SD card integration is not very seamless or integrated, for that matter.

The sound on this mp3 player is excellent. It offers numerous equalization presets along with a customizeable option. The player is small and sleek and fits in my coin pocket in my jeans perfectly. The video display is amazing. The player allows you to create slideshows with customizeable transitions and you also have the option of setting your own wallpaper with a picture of your own. The player also includes some very decent images already stocked for you to utilize as well. A nice additional touch is the SD card option. Although you will be able to slide a card in and view whatever media you have on the card, you basically have to hault all functions on the Zen to access these files. In other words, if you are listening to music and want to look at photos on the SD card the player will stop playing before allowing you to actually view anything. Take in mind too that any media on the card cannot be transferred to the Zen via the player. Any editing would have to be done via the media organizer. However it is still nice to have the option of an SD card port. This comes in handy if you want to share some new photos you have taken with friends without having to take your camera along with you as well. 
The button layout is pretty well thought out. The buttons have a good, solid feel to them and I have rarely hit the wrong button other than being a result of my own misdirection. That said, the grooves around the buttons seem to attract just about every piece of lint, hair or dust that they come into contact with. This is primarily a cosmetic flaw, but none the less, it is worth mentioning.
Another problem is I have had the player freeze up on me from time to time with no consistant reason as to why or how. This problem is magnified by the fact that the reset button is so tiny it literally requires something as fine as a needle to access. A toothpick or paperclip are way to thick, so if this thing freezes on you mid-road trip or on a jog, you're probably going to be out of luck, unless you carry a needle with you.
Another slight flaw is the media organizer. While, in itself  it serves it's purpose, one big flaw was the ability to manipulate items already in your player via the organizer. For example, I had some songs in my zen that I wanted to move to a new folder, both of which I could clearly see in the organizer. However, for some reason I was not able to transfer the song to the new folder. Instead, I had to find the song on my PC and transfer THAT file into my zen and delete the song file on my zen. This, obviously, will be a headache for those wanting to re-allocate numerous files. This is unexcusable, in my opinion, but it is what it is.
Lastly, I was dissapointed in the peripherals that have been made available for this unit. Off all the cases that are offered, NONE have any kind of screen protection. This makes little sense to me. Sure, you can buy the laminated adhesive clear covers, but these tend to leave a sticky residue and they ALWAYS blister, which would completely contradict this beautiful display. I hope they release something better in the future. As it is, I have refused to shell out any extra money for a cover that I will not be satisfied with, thus I still carefully carry this thing around unprotected.
This review may seem to focus on the negative, but I do like to make others aware of what they can expect. I still stand by the 4 stars I give this product. I do love it, and there is more upside than down. I have yet to come across the perfect mp3 player, but with a few tweaks to the software and hardware itself, the Creative Zen is definitely a front runner. Buy with confidence.

The SanDisk 4GB Sansa Clip MP3 Player is still one of my favorite MP3 designs.  More color and size options are now available, and I continue to buy them to give as gifts and to upgrade capacity for myself.  Some I use for music and some primarily for the voice recording feature.  In addition to the silver SanDisk Sansa Clip 4 GB MP3 Player, they now offer this black version.  While the product picture makes this black version look the same as the 1 GB black players, it is actually shinier akin to the silver version.  

The Sansa Clip hasn't come down in price as much as I would like, but it's still a great value at any capacity.  The 4GB model has twice the capacity of the 2 GB iPod Shuffle for about 60% of the price.  It also has a screen, FM Tuner, voice recording and more.  You can also get the Sansa Clip 1 GB or SanDisk Sansa Clip 2 GB which are still sold.  But with sizes for MP3 players growing, buying the largest size you can is probably the best option.

Pros - 
+ Nice compact MP3 player with built-in clip for extra portability
+ Good combination of features, design and value
+ Decent sound quality for a small MP3 player
+ Nice capacity for a decent price
+ Very light-weight 
+ FM tuner with 40 presets!!!
+ Voice recording  
+ Nice design and color options
+ Nice format compatibility (MP3, DRM WMA, WMA, Audible)
+ USB 1.1 and 2.0 connectivity 
+ Can be used as a USB drive / mass storage
+ Can sync music with drag & drop or via software
+ 15 hours battery life is better than Creative Zen Stone Plus or iPod Shuffle

Cons 
- Larger body than the 2nd and 3rd generation iPod shuffles
- Some durability questions linger, though these black units have definitely been updated
- Some reports of defective units, so check yours within the return period
- Increasing number of low cost alternatives in feature rich MP3 players make it less of a slam dunk

The new Sandisk Sansa Clip may not be as durable as the iPod shuffle, but it still has the advantages of the iPod shuffle with some of the features and benefits of other MP3 player brands.  Unlike the Sansa Express, which you can plug in directly into your USB port, the clip uses a standard USB B cable.  

The Clip is definitely a little bigger than the iPod shuffle, but not by much.  It has a great feel and a nicer clip. It is also priced right.  It fills the market for a starter MP3, workout unit, or gift.

The rechargeable battery seems better than the Creative Zen Stone Plus and gives you a respectable 15 hours. The sound is nice. The ear buds are passable for beginners but most people will replace them.  As for durability, only time will tell; so far my units are holding up nicely.

I definitely recommend the larger sizes, whether 2GB or 4GB. For those needing more space there are larger versions but they are somewhat hard to find online.  For those who need more capacity and video playback, you will have to explore the Creative Zen, Sansa Fuze, Sansa View or new iPod Nano.  All of those units have higher price tags.

SanDisk Sansa View 8 GB MP3 Player
SanDisk Sansa View 16 GB MP3 Player
SanDisk Sansa Fuze 8 GB MP3 Player
Creative Zen 8 GB
Creative Zen 16 GB
Apple 8 GB iPod nano AAC/MP3 Player Black (3rd Generation)  

You also have to consider the newer low cost players from Transcend, which may not have as good of a reputation as Sandisk but offers even more capabilities for the cash.  

CONCLUSION

This is still a great starter unit for yourself or to give as a gift. Hopefully the new batches have improved durability.  The same great features are all here that will keep this design around for a while.

Enjoy.

If this fence didn't work, the dog was going to have to go!  We live near the mountains and have lots of wildlife around, and our super friendly puggle Ruby couldn't resist chasing the deer and/or going to visit her friends.  Housetrained, great with kids, and wonderfully sweet-but we couldn't keep her in the yard!  It was just too hard--with three little kids, a husband who travels, and lots of running in and out the door I just couldn't chase her through the mountains one more time.  

My husband insisted on trying this fence before I found her a new home.  I figured that if it didn't work we'd just send it back.  He had it set up and calibrated to the correct radius in an hour.  It's been a little over two weeks since the first training session and I am pleased to report that Ruby stays home in the zone all the time!  I almost cried the first time I saw her get shocked, but she has since learned that the warning beep means it--and she stays home in the yard.  We followed the training schedule quite closely but it wasn't hard at all.  I figured that as much as Ruby loves other dogs and people she would run right through the charge, but she doesn't--she stays home. 

Definitely worth a try.  The only drawback is that our neighbors/her friends are sad to not get to see her anymore.  The best pet investment we've ever made.

My daughter is now 16 months old and we have been using these dipes from the beginning, minus a few packs of Pampers we got as a shower gift.  The pampers mixed with pee gave off a horrible smell, I assume it's from the bleaching chemicals used to make the diaper white?  Then we tried some Natural Baby ones when 7Gen changed their tabs that I did not like.  Now those were some diapers that leaked!  So, back to 7Gen we come.  

These dipes far outweigh any others!  I don't understand the negative reviews seen here.  We do not have leaks at all.  She can go all night with no problems.

UPDATE:  I have been using this gate with the New Baby.  He is now 20 months old and there are absolutely no complaints...just praise.  The pedal seems to be improved as I have yet to have it break.  I still recommend this gate above and beyond all the rest.  Matter of fact I am about to buy another one this weekend to put upstairs.


I used this gate for both of my girls and eventually a little girl that my MIL babysat.  It's very durable and the ease of use and set up is great. It's also a plus that the fram stays in place and you dont' have to remove it all the time like other gates. The one part that might give out will be the pedal.  My husband broke it once when we first got this because the animal that he is put too much weight on it (the gate stands up nicely to regular pressure).  I do have to say that the company was great when I called them for a replacement part and sent it out the very same day. I am now 4 1/2 months pregnant and will buy a new one.  I have no doubts or bad things to say about this gate.  It was well worth the money. I had tried several other gates and was not happy at all with any of them.

Long story short, the most difficult thing about installing this product is getting it out of the blister pack in the first place.  

The provided instructions (you can actually download or read the manual on the web while you're waiting for the Bluetooth dongle to arrive) are very clear, the install is a snap....but you've read other reviews and know that already.

Here's the true beauty of this tiny piece of hardware.  It links to practically everything!  Because it is not only Bluetooth 2.0 compliant but also backward compatible to Bluetooth 1.1 and also supports stereo audio you won't have any issues connecting to a Bluetooth mouse or stereo headset.  

Within minutes of the install I had the little (and I mean tiny) GBU421 linked to my Motorola cell phone (audio and dialing from the laptop, no need to ever get the phone out of pocket or purse), a PDA, Garmin GPS Mobile10, Bluetooth headset and a mouse.  The crazy thing is IOGear has managed to make this thing work with all the above simultaneously.  

Anyone considering a 'look alike' Bluetooth dongle featured by some eBay and other sellers, don't bother.  Either they aren't 2.0 or aren't backward compatible (you lose the use of most Bluetooth mice) won't handle stereo audio and sometimes all the above.  

Very impressive IOGear...and did I mention it's really tiny?

This is a great two in one. You got the ball that goes round and round and you got the kitty scratcher. Add a little cat nip and watch them play with it for hours! My kitties love it! This is the second one we have bought. The first one we had for 5+ years and it never got boring to them!

The wheel's FF and feel and overall quality are very good. It is extremely useful to have the option of paddle or stick shifter.  I use my paddles to shift and the pull back on the shifter as the handbrake and push forward is clutch.  I have also had the stick as shift and paddles as clutch and ebrake.  Pedals and wheel are both very precise.

Of course, as with most people, I am having occasional trouble with the pedals.  Mainly the brake 'sticking' on. This started after about 6months of heavy use and now at a year hasn't gotten much worse.  Usually unplugging the pedals from the wheel and plugging it back in will fix the problem.  We'll see if that will keep working.

This nice red flask works quite well and fits in my jacket pocket. First I worried about the two-pronged USB cable that came with it, but I used the drive on 4 different computers (including 3 laptops, one of them is Dell from 2003) and never needed second USB port to power it. This is not a speed monster, but neither is any other portable drive. I'm completely satisfied with performance. I give 5 stars for look and feel/build quality/size and 4 for performance.

Like most SOHO routers, it has nearly non-existant logging. And provides near zero-statistics. SOHO boxes don't give you a clue about who is one your network or what they are doing. This is universal across every brand I've worked with. If a PC asks & takes a DHCP address you'll have that record, but that's it. Very easy for visitors to be invisible on all home-marketed boxes.

I'm disappoointed Linksys still doesn't allow mapping specific IP addressses in DHCP (what Windows Server people call Reservations). Netgear and Dell (which I think may be DLink rebranded) do.

BEST SECURITY PRACTICES I RECOMMEND...

Pick a UNIQUE SSID. SSID are like filenames in Windows. When your laptop come home it must have a profile with the SID. If you leave it as LINKSYS you will have to wipe out your config to connect to someone else's LNKSYS router cause they didn't change the default SSID on their router.

MAC filtering stops visitors from using your network but they can still spy on your traffic. MAC filtering isn't too hard and it is just a config change on the router. You don't have to monkey with the PC config. Easy and a basic step, but if you have suspicious teenae computer geeks in the area, maybe not enough for privacy.

Best practice is learn how to setup encryption. WEP encryption is weak but most computer people couldn't figure out how to break it. WPA is best. Problem is sometimes you can't get a visiting laptop to work with certain encryption. Getting Apple/Macs was historically a pain, but they've all improved interoperability now. Encryption means people can't join OR read what you're doing.

We just had our first child and my wife repeatedly asked for a video camera for Christmas.  Myself, being a very avid photographer (still camera) was not so interested in purchasing a 2nd video camera that neither my wife or I would want to carry around...nor really ever had an interest in going back to watch videos on tape, casssette, etc.  As a test compromise I suggested we try the Mino HD as easy to use, fits in purse/pocket and really did 95% of what want to do, which is capture special moments of baby & family.

On Christmas Eve the UPS box arrived with the new Mino (paid $199). Opened the box and with 3 minutes we were recording videos.  The user interface of controls, TV hookup and instant software load with USB is brilliant...I would say better than Ipod in fact.  4 hours after we owned the device we sent video Xmas cards to relatives, had videos of the baby with Great Grandma, etc.  On image quality, will you be making an Indi flick with this device?...No, but for viewing on TV/Computer the quality of the video is great.  Also, software has ability to capture stills of the video and save to your personal folders, email, etc.

If have any hesitation about buying a mino don't.  And if fretting between the HD and non-HD version...spend the extra $50 for the HD.  I compare

Before this router I had a Linksys WRT54G running custom DD-WRT firmware for three years. The router eventually gave up after lots of peer-to-peer traffic, and I chose the D-Link DIR-655 to replace it.

Setup for the D-Link was absolutely basic. The web configuration interface is extensive and easy to understand. I was up and running in about five minutes out of the box. There are a couple of annoying screens, such as the static list of 50 or whatever port forwarding rules, but most of the interface is top notch.

As far as performance goes, the D-Link now has an uptime of one month, since I got it, and has successfully hosted multiple wireless laptops, peer-to-peer traffic, streaming of video from Netflix, online gaming, all without a hiccup. The range is excellent, too. I live on the fourth floor of an apartment building and my iPhone will stay connected and working as I walk down the stairs (through a couple of walls from the router) to the outside, and then as I walk around the building. Nice to have full connection when I am walking the dogs. :)

My stepson, who is an I/T guy, recommended this router to me.  Part of the consideration was that my PC is at least 5 years old, although we have done some upgrading to it.  Anyway, setting up the router was a breeze, and it's worked like a charm ever since.

This router was easy to setup, I just ran the software on a wired in computer and it started working with my cable broadband router.  An IBM 42T laptop and Dell 6000 laptop easily find the router and have excellent connections a floor away and several rooms over.  The laptops also print to an HP wireless printer which set up without any problems.  All of this just worked without a bunch of complicated codes or addresses being configured manually. And I have a Motorola 5.8 phone that doesn't seem to be affected by the wireless system at all.

My son and I have really enjoyed this egg/toaster. It's easy to use and clean. It's especially convenient to use while getting ready for work as you can start it and shower or dress while it's working. Your breakfast is done all at the same time. The only thing that would make it a bit nicer would be to have two egg pans instead of one. I've also used it to make hard boiled eggs and it worked great!

This review is from: The Little Mermaid (Limited Issue) (DVD)

      



I am probably one of the biggest Little Mermaid fans in the world.  I saw this movie 8 times in the theaters when it came out in 1989 and then 4 more times when it was released in 1997 (I think).  I preordered the original VHS video and picked it up the day it came out, and I watched it that day even though I had gone to the hospital due to a bad head accident that same day which resulted in unpleasant headaches for a couple days.  I clipped out the original reviews and stories on the movie from the LA Times.  I got the Sebastion Christmas tree ornament from a McDonalds Happy Meal.  I bought the Soundtrack CD, and I bought the rerelease of the VHS video, etc, etc...And now I have this DVD... which is good only in that it is digital (meaning better sound and video quality) and slightly letterboxed.  I have a big gripe about this DVD though.  First of all, there are absolutely no extra features, unless you count &quot;Region 1 Coded,&quot; &quot;interactive menus,&quot; and &quot;chapter search.&quot;  No trailers, no TV spots, no making of documentaries, no interviews, no storyboards, no audio commentary, well, you get the point.  Basically I hate this DVD even though I love this movie.  The annoying new cover also bothers me, why couldn't they use the original movie poster covers?  Perhaps it didn't appeal to the kids enough.  I still recommend getting this DVD, since a special edition may never come out or maybe not until you or I are dead.  One last problem with this DVD (and for that matter, all video versions of it also), during the end credits, after &quot;Under the Sea&quot; finishes (rather fades out), the song &quot;Part of Your World&quot; plays, followed by the score.  Now, I'm pretty sure that in the theatrical release of this movie, &quot;Under the Sea&quot; is NOT followed by this song, but rather by orchestral score music.  This is kind of annoying, but I'm sure you won't mind if you bother buying this DVD at all.  My question to Disney is, when will &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;Aladdin&quot; come out (and Lion King too I guess)???  I think I hate Disney almost as much as I hate George Lucas because of their annoying DVD release policies.  Above all, this movie is GREAT and you will and must cherish it forever!!

I love the color a lot, great contrast with my black CaseLogic Small External Hard Drive Case. The product itself is really easy to use. You don't have to install any software to use the product; however, it is best to register the product right away when you get it to upgrade your warranty.  the hard drive is small and easy to transport data from your computer's hard drive to this hard drive. it doesn't make a lot of noise, just a little vibration but nothing major; and the most important thing is it doesn't get hot. On the scale of 1 to 10, i give it a 9.5.

It is what you'd expect. It holds your music and videos. It plays your music and videos. The battery life isn't what I expected - figure about 3-4 hours of uninterrupted music playback. I expected that with the videos, but figured music would last longer. Maybe it's the color screen? Maybe I got one that doesn't have a good battery? Who knows.

And the only way to charge it seems to be by plugging it into the computer via its USB cable. Prior to this Nano, i had a 4th gen iPod classic (the one RIGHT before they introduced color screens). that one came with a plug-in charger. I wish these new ones still had that...

I haven't found Jillian's workouts my style so I was hesitant to get this one, but did because of the good reviews.  I don't regret that, this is a good workout and really got me sweating.  The only exception is that I hurt my knee during jumping jacks.  She says 400 pound people do jumping jacks and I'm nowhere near that, but I do have weak knees and they didn't appreciate the jumping jacks.  I modify them now during this workout but go really fast to keep the same intensity.  If I burn 50 less calories, I can live with that as long as I can keep working out and I'm not sidelined because of an injury.
This is a great quick workout that really gets the whole body involved and Jillian is less abrasive in it than she normally is.

Angelina Jolie's performance was terrific. All the "bad guys" were played very very well, too. 

Great, engaging story and a very well-made crime movie.

I let other reviewers do more thorough nitpicking, but I wish to add a detail missing in the film: Northcott's killings of young boys were not without a reason, the real Northcott was a pedophile sadist who abducted boys, hid them on his chicken ranch, and after he had buggered them, he rented them out to wealthy southern Californian pedophiles. Only when he tired of his young captives he shot them or shattered their skulls with an axe. 

The names of the other pedophiles involved were never disclosed to the public. 

Details of the crimes are published in "Nothing is Strange with You: The Life and Crimes of Gordon Stewart Northcott."

I have owned the B60 for a couple of weeks now and I couldn't be much happier.  Convenient to use, it makes a piping hot cup of Joe fast.

I especially appreciete the timer function that shuts the unit off when you designate, so you're not wasting energy keeping the water tank hot.  Even when it is off, it still heats the water within 1 minute and you are ready to make your first cup.

The drawback to it is my travel mugs do not fit under the spout, but that is easily solved by keeping a mug enarby.  Althouhg it has a couple of settings, even the largest cup setting isn't nearly big enough for my travel mug.

That actually turns out to work in my favor because while I enjoy coffee every day, I don't like it strong or bitter like a Starbucks or Cup O Joe.  I will reuse the kcup once or even twice to get a weaker cup of coffee, which suites me fine.

Others have complained about the noise of the pump and while I agree it could be less intrusive, it's not going to wake the rest of the house up by any means.

I'm looking forward to many fast & good cups of coffee with my Keurig.  Highly recommended and here's hoping more retail stores will carry them in the future.

Having seen the movie more than once has given me a more nuanced appreciation of this epic movie. Its storyline tackles the relationship between two people coming from different cultures who eventually found themselves together -- initially at odds, in love, and part of a family unit -- all amidst the backdrop of the sprawling Australian outback, the divide of races and social strata, the age-old clash between good and evil, and the onset of the second world war in the Pacific! The movie experience is like curling up with an extraordinary epic novel - and at the end feeling what a well-spent afternoon it has been! 

The movie's length does justice to this tale of love and adventure in a faraway culture and of unusual natural beauty. The cinematography provides all the lush scenes of the Australian landscape, the rush of blood in some of the most awesome action scenes, and the loving closeups of the story of the relationship between Lady Sarah Ashley, The Drover, and their defacto son, Nullah! The musical score gives the movie the perfect complement to the excellent cinematography. The story unwinds from an initial meeting full of comedic winks ( including the now famous shower scene - featuring the leading man!) and clashing cultures. It then dawns on the central role played by the child Nullah and his aboriginal culture. Plus what would an epic movie be without the quintessential villains? As the movie progresses and we witness the triumph of the independent cattle company versus the monopoly, it also gives us a slice of Australian history and its development in its early frontiers. When the second world war breaks out and it marches down to Darwin, we are caught in another story between good and evil, so cinematically well-portrayed. And they lived happily ever after, with a twist --the expected end of a truly epic movie! 

Who are the main characters and how are they portrayed? 

Lady Sarah Ashley is the English rose who became an adopted daughter of the Australian frontier. She is transformed into a loving nurturer of a child and the harsh land because the relationship which came into her life also changed her outlook. Nicole Kidman very ably portrays this complicated woman who changes from a non-sympathetic character to a caring heroine. This transformation is so well portrayed in the changing face of Lady Ashley - from the very beautiful and well-turned out woman to the woman whose inner beauty shines through her bedgraggled locks and almost plain face, through her pained expression as she undergoes tragedy and is touched by sorrow, and finally to the look of someone who has come to terms with what is important in life. This is one of Nicole's best movie portrayals! 

The Drover has a mysterious past and a rough image as we are first introduced to him. He is a man who is iconic in the history of the outback but it was his reaching out to the shunned aboriginal community in the past which showed that he was an extraordinary man. In the song by Elton John, played second in the movie credits, called The Drover's Ballad, his story turns out to be rich in tragedy and a life full of love for the outback, which gives us more of a complete picture of this man with a heart of gold. The tragic life seems to follow him even much later in the movie - and this is where he shows his heart on his sleeve! Hugh Jackman is magnificent in the role and it is hard to imagine anybody else giving a more masterful performance. The magnificence is not just in how he looked ( Baz Luhrmann did show Hugh Jackman as the representation of physical perfection...surprisingly, because the other choice was Nicole Kidman) but also in his acting chops. There are several scenes where Hugh displays his acting range at the highest emotional level - when he realizes that the people he loved may have become victims of the tragedy of war...and then the realization that fate had actually been kinder. Who can't help but be mesmerized by his face and his voice in the scene by the burning war HQ and at the ruined bar, in the Mission Island rescue, and at the wharf in Darwin? Had the past of the drover been more meaningfully played out on the screen, the role could have garnered Hugh an award recognition! 

The third important role is the child Nullah, as charmingly portrayed by a new child actor named Brandon Walters. He charms everyone except the villain. He is in a sense at the heart of the story and Brandon makes us follow Nullah's journey with almost a maternal/paternal eye for his welfare in the story. At the end, he is conflicted about his real family and culture, but I am sure that when Nullah grows up, it will both cultures and both families that he will truly call his own! 

Kudos likewise to the actors who portrayed the main villain, the iconic aboriginal character, the Drover's friend and main man, even the hotel keeper and his gruff ways...as well as to the other Australian actors who gave life to this epic story. 

The creatives have done well to transform such a tale magnificently on screen! Baz Luhrmann provides the vision and the direction of the story-telling with such interesting and charismatic characters and amidst a magnificent background of natural beauty, culture, and slices of history! 

While the movie could only be given full justice in a cinema with its impressive big screen and excellent sound, I would still love to get a DVD/blu-ray version to allow me to see it again and again - much like wanting to read and re-read a very good epic novel!

I've had a Lacie hard drive for almost three years now and it's never given me any problems (knock on wood). When I went looking for more hard drive space I looked around and I thought the Lacies had the best reviews within terms of reliability (which is the most important thing to me). I did have to send the first Lacie back because it wouldn't read anything and kept saying error, but they sent me one within a few days and it's worked fine. I have noticed people saying it's loud and gets hot but it's really not noticeable to me - every hard drive is like that to some extent. If your going to travel around with it I would recommend a case because it would definitely break if I dropped it. This is the one i bought for 16.99:

My nutritionist recommended that I get this model of pedometer.  I've never had one before, so I don't know what to expect from one.  This one was pretty easy to set up.  I don't use any of the advanced features on it, though.

My only complaints so far:
- I can't figure out a way to pause the pedometer (to have it not track steps even though I'm wearing it).  Sometimes I want to do this when I'm on a hike where I don't feel the hike is a part of my daily routine and don't want it to record, but I forget to take it off before I start hiking.
- I don't like how I can't change any of the settings without resetting the whole thing.
- Sometimes when I only walk a few steps, the pedometer doesn't record my steps.

What I do like about it:
- It doesn't record any steps when I wiggle around or when I'm not actually taking steps.
- It's pretty easy to use.
- It seems pretty sturdy so far.  I've dropped it maybe half a dozen times already on hard surfaces (I've only had it for a few weeks, though, so we'll see how it holds up).
- It keeps in memory my steps per day for the last 7 days.

This is a nice compact unit that as far as i am concerned gives a fairly accurate reading. Follow the simple directions and make sure you put the cuff on with the "arrow" facing down your arm and facing up and viola!, blood pressure taken. The unit stores readings, highs and lows, and comes in handy when doing comparisons based on daily or bi-daily exercise routines or for monitoring health issues. I think the only draw back of the unit would be the size of the cuff, it comes with a standard arm size cuff. I would have liked to seen it just a hair or two bigger as my arm runs 19.25 inches around on the right and my left is 18.75 inches. Other than ordering a larger cuff though i have no complaints. I hope this helps somewhat on your purchasing desicion, there are many out there and at a higher price and cheaper ones to, this one just seems to fit the bill for me. Thanks for your time.

I bought the Ipod touch for my wife.  She enjoys the card games that are available for it.  I own a Palm TX for work which she used to play on and was adding wear to the screen. The Ipod touch is an amazing, enjoyable device. I looked at the competing higher end MP3 players but found the Ipod touch was the most versatile of all of them. The battery capacity is not as good as my Palm, but it is sufficient to play two or three hours of card games at a time. I bought the 8 meg. I put two full length movies, 12 music albums ,a handfull of photos, and 8 game apps on it on it and still have 3.7 GB of storage available.

REVIEW:  Five stars for when it is working, subtract a star because it isn't working.  I have the V20 version.  Actually, this is my second one.  The first died within a year, the second died at three years.  These are not cheap machines and I would have expected them to last longer. They saw weekly, undemanding use.  The paddles simply stop turning or freeze up, which you only discover when the thing beeps "Done!" and you're confronted by The Mass Of Dough.  Having said that, when the little paddles turned, the V20 did a terrific job.  I miss my funcitoning V20. 

QUESTIONS:  Has anyone been using the X20 for any length of time and, if so, is it study?  Has anyone used the new Cuisinart bread machine and can they compare the two?

I was a little nervous about buying this hard drive since it only connects via USB.  I have to say that my concern was unwarranted, since this hard drive was quick to back up the first time I used it.  On top of that, I was pleasantly surprised how well my Mac OS 10.5.6 recognized the hard drive, it works superbly well with "timemachine".  Also, the design is so sleek and elegant that enjoy seeing it on my desk--something you cannot say about so many other hard drives I have seen on the market.

I am currently using the Sling Catcher in conjunction with a Sling Box to send my Satellite and HD DVR from my living room TV to the TV in my bedroom.  This saves me a minimum of $17 a month as opposed to paying for a second receiver and line.  It also circumvents the need for me to have a cable jack installed in my room.  The Sling Catcher works in conjunction with a program called Sling Projector which enables you to click on a video screen on a computer or laptop and have just that video projected to the TV wirelessly, this allows you to watch internet clips and movies on your TV.  It also allows you to project the entire screen.  This would be ideal for using a TV as a monitor since it would eliminate the need to have a cable connecting your TV to the computer.  The Sling Catcher is nice and small and takes up very little room.  It is easy to set up, you only need to hook up one cable to your TV and then you hook up the Sling Catcher to the internet.  If you don't have an internet connection in the room you wish to use the Sling Catcher in you can use the Sling Link to hook up to your internet through your house's power lines.  The remote and the unit are both stylishly designed.  The remote is exceptionally easy to use and program.  It has all the buttons you might need in order to control almost any device and also has several programmable buttons.  The only downside I have found is the delay in operating other devices since the signal first has to navigate the internet before being sent to the device being watched.

Overall, this is an excellent device that allows you to use your existing cable or satellite hook-up in any room while also offering a host of other interesting features.

Wow - really didn't think Angel Eyes would work. I have a beautiful little maltese 4 month old puppy that had a horrible red stain between and under her eyes.  It made her cute little face look terrible. I tried the tear stain wipes and was using them on a regular basis, but they did not help.  I read about Angel Eyes on the internet and really thought that it would be a hoax.  I did everything that others had suggested.  I waited until she was asleep and using a magnifying glass made sure that I cut all the hair that could be in her eyes.  I also changed her food.  I was giving her Eukanuba, which after reading the label, found has beet pulp in it and therefore, changed to Wellness.  I received Angel eyes and Sadie turned her nose up at it, so I did as someone suggested and made tiny meatballs, adding the correct amount of Angel Eyes to each one.  They were so simple because all I had to do was throw one in the microwave for 20 seconds and it was done.  She absolutely loved them and I had no problem getting her to eat them.  Within one week I noticed the tears drying up and in turn the red color was disapprearing. I also started using a herbal tear stain remover and did have to cut away a few of the really red hairs. I received Angel Eyes on 3/3/08 and as of today, 4/5/08 her little face is perfect. She has a beautiful white face and Angel Eyes is worth every penny.  I am now using it every other day.  I am one of the most skeptical people alive when it comes to purchasing a product on the internet and generally will not go by someone else's reviews because I always assume the company put someone up to writting a good review.  I don't know if this product works for everyone, but it sure worked for me. Now when people look at my little Sadie, they can see the beautiful little girl she is.

I'm trying to recall what life was like before the Back to Basics TEM500 Egg & Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg Poacher, and quite frankly I can barely remember it.  I seem to remember a lot more sadness in my life.

Now that I can poach my eggs in the SAME MACHINE that I'm toasting my bread(!), I save so much time and energy.  In the olden days, I used to have to walk two--sometimes three feet from the toaster to the stove.  But no longer!  Now I get to stand in place and just watch the magic happen.  Hey, exercise: see you later.  It was nice knowing you (NOT!)

And while I haven't calculated how much time I've saved by eliminating the aforementioned two- or three-foot walk, I'd reckon that by the end of the year, I will have banked literally minutes upon minutes that I can use at my leisure.  How will I use this extra time?  Hmm?  Some more poached eggs and toast sound like a yummy way to pass the time.

Since I got the machine in mid-February I have gained 18 or so pounds, but it's mostly muscle and cholesterol.

Yay, progress!

I've used it once and it was great. I made a cuban sando and the bread toasted up just right. The cheese and meat cooked to prefection. It cleaned up like a champ.

Updated: I have had my griddler for several months and continue to be very happy with it's performance. It is great for cooking single servings of meat (my wife is a vegetarian). It does really well on chicken breast & burgers. My wife uses it for tofu (prior to me cooking meat of course) and it works awesome, great grill marks.

i gave my son one of these two years ago; he lives in a condo in honolulu with so little space in the kitchen he made a wooden cover for the stovetop and nine out of ten meals he uses the griddler, even for breakfast and some fabulous party fare.  when he told me how much he loves it and how much he uses it i decided to get one for me...or, rather, my husband got one for me.  he is right....it's good for any meal, any time of day and to make almost anything.  it is the best all-in-one appliance that has ever been made.  Thank you!   Terry W.

This is a good DVD - she definitely works you.  I was concerned that it might be too advanced for me at this point as I've recently lost 50 lbs. have about 40 more to go and I've just recently started really working out other than treadmill which I'd been doing.  But I was surprised that I honestly could do most of this DVD.  There are some areas where I try to use good judgment and find another move that works for me if one is too advanced at this point (a fair amount of jumping at times if you have knee problems or anything).  But she's a good trainer and I highly recommend the DVD if you're serious about losing weight, getting in shape or staying in shape.  Another trainer / DVD series I applaud is Violet Zaki.  Love her style of teaching and workouts the best of all I have tried so far.

"Breaking Dawn" along with its predecessors is nothing short of a breath of fresh air. I couldn't have expected anything more from the last installment of the "Twilight" series. It was everything I could have asked for and then some. Stephenie is a true Genius. it takes a lot for me to get interested in a book. But with the entire series of "Twilight" I was utterly enthralled into the pages and creating the most amazing images with stephenie's literary genius. "Breaking Dawn" definitely lived up to my expectations and blew my mind. I just wish it wasn't over. I truly hope that Stephanie continues with the follow up of "midnight sun" I would love to see Edwards perspective. "Breaking Dawn" is by far my favorite in the series but I love them all. Everything is wrapped up nicely in the final book.

Unbelievable the amount of cat hair this tool collected on each of our cats.  The little 8 pound cat absolutely loves it, the 20 pound cat not so much.  I used the medium one on the 20 pound and maybe it worked too well as he now has a thinning spot on his backside.  Would recommend using light pressure and sticking with the small one for cats.  Overall great for cats, great for humans if you want to minimize fur on furniture.

I've tried numerous Crest and Rembrandt whitening products and I must say this one is now my favorite. You can talk, drink water, and salivate all you want during those 30 minutes of wait time-hooray! My only complaints are the upper and lower strips are packaged together and they REALLY stick to your teeth. So far no pasty white burning gums which is a big relief. Another bonus is the enclosed $7 off future purchase coupon which doesn't expire until 2010. I plan on stocking up now in order to get the coupons, plus Amazon's current special deal makes this a terrific bargain.

I bought this bread machine a month ago and have tried lots of kinds of bread. The total result is satisfactory. Except first time, I always got beautiful bread. The only thing is you have to get the bread out of the machine immediately after it is ready, so I thought the timer option is not practical.  Besides, the dough I tried to make for dinner rolls or buns were also not very good, though I followed the receipt.

When my baby was four weeks old (now one year old), he would not sleep on his back.  The only time "we" got any sleep was when he was on his belly on my chest or laying next to me in bed.  When my hubby mentioned this to our pediatrician, we got a stern talking to and he insisted that we make our baby sleep on his back in his bassinet or crib.  I researched ways to help my baby sleep comfortably on his back and found lots of positive reviews for the Swaddleme.  So...I forked out the cash and bought one.  Much to my surprise, it worked!  The main reason my son had such a difficult time sleeping on his back was due to the startle reflex.  He would wake himself up when his little arms would flail around.  The Swaddleme kept him bundled and he had less episodes of waking himself up.  I bought two more and used them until he was around 6 months old.  Make sure your wrap your little one up nice and tight otherwise they tend to do a Houdini and get their arms out the top.  By the time my son was 4-5 months old, he was sleeping with his arms out (and the startle reflex was mainly gone), but he still enjoyed the comfort of it wrapped around him.  Also, don't put your baby in really warm clothes since this adds a layer to their sleepwear.  I highly recommend trying a Swaddleme if you are having a difficult time with your baby sleeping on his/her back.

My fiance and I bought ours maybe 6 months ago and we love it.  He does the whole egg-sausage-muffin-cheese thing a few times a week.  He's an early morning commuter, so he sets it to cook while he takes a quick shower and then wraps it in some wax paper to take with him on the drive.  Mind you, if you multi-task while its cooking, you better like your egg well-done because it does keep cooking in the steam after the toaster turns off.  
Myself, I do everything but the sausage.  I think it makes a fairly healthy breakfast if you eat some fruit on the side.  I like my yolk soft and gooey, so I'm there as soon as it's done.  It's always hot enough to melt the cheese I put on top, too.  
Somebody commented that you can't do two eggs in a row, but I've done it many times right after my fiance. 
It's not the best toaster, but if you keep the setting between Low and Med-low it comes out alright.

This product is by far the best out there for men who like a cleaned up apperance.  We are in the day and age of a well groomed man and norelco embraced it and made a machine that does the job.  Best $40 I have ever spent on grooming supplies.

No Snags, cuts or razor burn.  It for sure says in the manual that you are not suspossed to use it on your face or scalp.  So those idiots who bought this and are using it for that should not be making bad comments against this wonderful product.

I've had several shavers...rechargeable, cord etc.  This one not only shaves just as close as the others, I use high capacity rechargeable batteries in it, and so far, two weeks later I'm still shaving everyday. Great design and I like the idea that the cap is attached to the shaver...no more losing cap.  Since most of the time the cap gets lost during travel, while it's in your bag, and that's how the head stands to get damaged. I canned the other expensive rechargeables since the battery often will not last the amount it claims to last, and now you have a $80 - 100 shaver that's useless since it will no longer hold a charge.  Cleaning on this shaver is very simple, just follow the directions.

This is my third pedometer.  It is by far the BEST pedometer I have ever owned. The best feature is the safety clip which prevents the pedometer from inadvertently falling to the ground.  The features are super-easy to use.  The numbers are easy to read.  I love how the unit re-sets itself to zero overnight.  I love being able to review the previous week's results, too.  It is lightweight and fits easily into a pocket.  The results are totally reliable, even when kept in a pocket.  I prefer to keep it in my pocket, actually.  It's more discreet than wearing it on my waistband for all to see.  I love it so much, I want to order another one just in case this one ever breaks.

I have one at the basement stairs and two others upstairs at the top and bottom of the stairs.  If I didn't LOVE these gates, I sure wouldn't have 3 of them.  My kids are always in the 97-100% range for height.  When my first was I'd say 3yrs. old he has been able to open the gate by him self to let him go and come freely while still keeping up for younger children.  I wouldn't want the kind with the pedal because then my kids would be able to open the gate a lot earlier by themselves than with this gate, plus you can't use the pedal kind of gates when you are coming down the stairs and the gate is at the bottom of the stairs.  This is a strong and secure gate.

And not only was it FREE, but they upgraded me to Premier!! They said they wanted to keep me as a customer! And they said I could tell you about it!!

Bought this based on reviews and the promise.  My children are very basic, meaning they do not like their food mixed/put together, i.e., caseroles, salads, etc., so I was not sure if they would like this.  Not only do they like the "breakfast sandwich," they can even make it themselves (the 7 and 9 year olds).  Hubby likes it, I like it.  East to make, easy to clean, not any bigger than a 4-slice toaster.  A bit pricey (got at Bed, Bath with the 20% off coupon, for a total of $32 +tax), however, it does deliver.

I love this media player!  The 8 gig internal memory is more than enough to keep me with non-repeated songs through my 10+ hour work day and subsequent 2 hours at the gym (as well as the 1 hour round tirp commute).  Video quality is WONDERFUL!  Although I've not used it yet, I love the fact that there is a card slot for expanded memory should i need it.  The only drawback I see is the fact that there's not a port for docking speakers.  But I use the auxiliary jack to plug into the docking speakers of my prior MP3 player and it works just fine!  The extras such as the alarm clock, microphone for voice notes, and calander are just icing on an already wonderful cake. The battery is quick to charge and a 3 hour charge last me all day and half the night!  I'm totally pleased with the product and the price!

What? Wears well in a little over a month of use?  HAHAHAH!  

That isn't a sign of wear at all!  Try TWO YEARS!  I've been using my Eclipse 2 for over two years with games such as BattleField2, Battlefield 2142, Unreal Tournament 2004 and Unreal Tournament3, Quake Wars, etc.

Please don't post that it wears well when you've had the keyboard for less than three months because you've barely used it long enough to even talk about how it wears.

I have seven keys that you can no longer read because the black paint has worn off of them!  You can barely read the key letters with the blue light on at the highest setting.  Red and "purple" allow for better readability with the "Purple" color being a bit more readable.

Other than the keys wearing out and the poor light transmission through the keys, this has been a great keyboard for me for gaming and other use.  It's been over two years and I haven't had a single key malfunction and I use this keyboard a lot.  Hours and hours of pretty heavy gaming.

I'll be looking for replacement keys.

I'd recommend this keyboard but I'm a bit disappointed in how the keys paint has worn off.

UPDATE!

I just got off the phone with Saitek customer support.  The warranty on this keyboard is 2 years! I called and told them about my seven keys with the paint worn off and they told me as long as I had a receipt they'd completely replace it with a new one! It's an exchange. My receipt says I purchased this keyboard on 1/04/2007 so it's under warranty.

Not only that but they said that when I receive my replacement keyboard the replacement receipt gives me another two years!  You can't beat that!

So, just keep your receipt and when something fails or the paint wears off, fill out the form and get a replacement for free! That's what I call good customer service!

I have used Turbo Tax and Taxcut. I decided years ago that Taxcut was better, or at least cheaper. This year I am waiting for a credit to be qualified by the IRS. It was very difficult to figure out that I had to wait for an update before I could file. It took me quite a while to figure out that it was due to the credit.
It is also difficult to figure out how I will use taxcut to file an amended return by reading the help.
But all in all, the interview process appears to be good, and it is relatively easy to move back and forth between the pieces. So, I say "Why pay more for TurboTax?"

I won't give a long winded review, but instead I'll just address some of the complaints. Overall, this machine really is pretty good for the price. 

As far as static goes, I don't personally have a problem with it. 

The settings seem to work pretty well. I definitely can tell the difference between each setting. But I agree with some complaints that it can be difficult to tell exactly which setting your on. If your unsure, turn the hopper counter clockwise (?) like you are going to take it off, and then turn it back and listen for the clicks that are audible as you move through each setting. 

Cleaning really isn't a problem on this machine. Yes, you have to clean this machine on a regular basis, get used to it. You have to do this with any coffee grinder. I can usually clean out the machine in under two minutes using a brush that I bought on my own. With the brush included, it may take an extra minute. 

The biggest complaint that I definitely agree with is the fact that somewhere between a teaspoon and a tablespoon of coffee is left in the grinder every time. This means that your first teaspoon-tablespoon of coffee you grind is actually coffee that you grinded last time. How you deal with this is kind of up to you. You can choose to fill the hopper with enough beans for each grind session and clean it out after every grind session, or just discard the first teaspoon-tablespoon of coffee that comes out. This is admittedly annoying, but not impossible to deal with. 

The entire unit, aside from the burr of course, is plastic. However, after around 7 months of frequent use, the unit is still holding up very well. I don't have any cracks in any part of the grinder at all. It's sturdy enough to hold up to daily use, just don't drop it on the floor.

I've seen some complaints about the grinder not working. You may just have a defective model. But you need to make sure that everything is seated correctly. If you did not seat the burr correctly, you will ruin your grinder. The machine is very easy to use, just read the instructions through at least once. And whatever you do, don't force the timer to 0. Good way to break your new grinder. Just let it run down. 

For the price, you really can't beat this grinder. It will give you a grind usable for most types of brewing, but this may be hit or miss for espresso. It will work if you use an espresso machine that has a pressurized portafilter system, but it really won't give you the adjustability you will need for most espresso machines. If you're looking for an espresso grinder, you'll need to go for nothing less than the gaggia mdf. The rancilio rocky would be your best budget bet for espresso grinders.

It's worth every penny to have diapers delivered directly to the door since this is an item used daily at our house.  With super saver shipping (a purchase over $25.00) there is no cost for shipping.  It ends up being 27 cents per diaper for a box of 160 size 3 pampers cruisers.  The last two times I have ordered this item, it has been delivered in two days!  I am extremely happy with the service amazon has provided and I recommend this item to anyone in the market for diapers.

I purchased this item because the one I currently owned had a cracked plastic ring where the blade connected.  I originally went on-line to purchase just the replacement part.  However, it was only $5 more to buy all brand-new.  My original mini-prep was more than 12 years old and served my kitchen needs well (chopping nuts and blending dressings mostly) and I expect the same service from the new one.

I think this is a great product. Lightweight and handy. I read some bad reviews about the picture quality, but I don't agree. Low light performance is still acceptable for point and shoot users.
Cons: The software is not that great to edit movies, but works pretty well to save and burn them.

We tried a few of the other single cup [pod] coffee makers but we just weren't satisfied. The Keurig B-60 truly makes a hot cup of delicious coffee quickly and much quieter than others that we've tried. The wide selection of K-cups is another plus for us. This one is a definite keeper and we will recommend it to friends.

I have been delighted with my machine - in reading some of the negative reviews, I noticed that most of the problems others mentioned were addressed in the manual.  I had an issue with one of my loaves - I looked in the book, determined the issue, corrected it and have not had a problem again.  This machine is well built, sturdy and turns out a perfect loaf each time - I took the time to read the manual BEFORE I used the machine.
I would highly suggest this product.

Wow. This is going back a ways. Just showed this movie to my wife whom has never seen it. Got talking about great 80s movies the other day with friends and I brought this one up. It brought smiles to the people who remember Howard and his friends. My brother and I loved this movie. Loved movies of the 80s. Even though lots of them were pretty corny, Howard was the duckiest dude of all. Cant take the heat, get out of the kitchen. Hope they bring Howard to dvd in the USA for all generations to enjoy!!!

I finished the book earlier this morning and have spent all day since then checking out websites and discussion boards about the series, and I cannot believe the negative response people are having to this book!! 

Yes, I understand that a lot of VERY unpredictable things happened, no one was expecting Bella to get pregnant, but why is that such a bad thing???  It's not like Stephenie Meyer is saying "teen pregnancy is the way to go" or anything-THIS IS FANTASY.  You can't compare their relationship to anyone else's.  Also, they ARE married.

Also, I was thrilled when Jacob imprinted on Renesme, why is everyone freaking out!!  Now Bella and Jacob can truly be family without the crazy love triangle that makes them both miserable!  

One last thing--For anyone that hated this book or feel "disappointed" in Stephenie Meyer, take a deep breath and read it again.  Once you get over the fact that all of your brilliant theories didn't turn out exactly how you imagined, I'm sure you'll fully enjoy and appreciate Breaking Dawn.  

Also, It's not like Stephenie Meyer is going to leave you high and dry!  We all know there's going to be more books coming, just not from Edward and Bella's perspective.  

So all in all, I thought the book was completely amazing, I nice ending to an amazing series, and I'm still shaking my head in wonder at all of the horrible reviews I am seeing.  

P.S. THIS IS STEPHENIE MEYER'S SERIES, PEOPLE. IF YOU DON'T LIKE HOW SHE ENDED THINGS, GO WRITE YOUR OWN ENDING.

I bought this product for my wife (she is in sales) and she loves it.  The only drawback I can find deals with my complete ignorance of the operating system (Linux).  The system runs great...but I have no idea how to update it or even link it to my home network (windows).  Each time I try to read up on it...I come away more confused.

Don't get me wrong..the spreadsheet, and word processing is extrememly similar to Excel and Word.  Easily saved and sent wirelessly through email to our home computer.  The thing works seamlessly...but as soon as I try to deviate from those simple task I run head first into not being familiar with Linux at all.

This is really a criticism that deals with my lack of knowledge...but if I had realized how hard it would be to run (or not be able to run) and executable file...I would have opted to have it pre-loaded with windows XP.

For now...she will keep using it (and loving it) and I will have to hope I can find time to figure out the operating system.

I bought this as a Christmas gift for my fiance last year. It was really a win-win situation - he needed a new trimmer and I was sick of seeing hair in the sink! Who would have thought you could get a trimmer with a VACUUM on it?

This thing really sucks .... but in a good way. The reservoir is a little small but if you empty it out, you will have no problem with all those hairs getting sucked into the machine. My fiance also uses this to shave/buzz his head! He rarely (if ever) goes to the barber anymore.  I have read from other reviewers that the trimmer will switch settings - I think this has only happened once for him and it wasn't a huge deal. 

Overall, this was a great price for this trimmer and the quality is excellent! I would recommend this trimmer :)

We've had a pedometer before, but it was a cheap mechanical one that did not measure distance correctly. Somehow, we came to believe that a pedometer could not work as advertised. I gave it another shot, though, thinking that a 'computerized' pedometer might be better. It is!

I'm so pleased with this unit. I've tested it quite a few times by walking from one city block to the next--exactly one mile, I know for certain; sure enough, the readout states the correct distance. This gives me confidence to vary the places I walk (I do like variety), knowing that the distance measurement is correct. Highly recommended for fitness walkers.

This review is from: The Little Mermaid (Limited Issue) (DVD)

      



Disney's renaissance saw a return to form after the disappointing Oliver and Company. The Little Mermaid not only saw the return of the great studio as a major driving force in cinematic imagination but also rejuvenated the art of animation itself. Released in the summer of 1989, Little Mermaid tells the classic Hans Christian Andersen tale of a mermaid who yearns to explore the world above the ocean. Inspired by the work of David Towns and Michael Peraza, the film became one of the most articulately- composed and artfully contrived animated novel adaptations in cinema history. The late Alan Menken's influence on the film's fantastically catchy underwater songs like 'Under the Sea' is all too obvious, but that's great homage to a truly gifted musician. The icing on the cake would be winning 2 Academy awards for best song and best musical score. Not bad for a animated musical and a great shot in the arm. 
Understandably the head honchos were concerned with the source material, considering the fable's tragic finale, but a couple of tweaks, a new ending and a singing Jamaican crab later, and the film was ready to set sail. The animation took a great leap from Disney's so-so input in the mid 80s, where the studio had reached a creativity apathetic nadir. If you want to argue (And you shouldn't) it should be noted that like Aladdin, the love struck mermaid is somewhat underwritten, surrounded by dancing fish she somewhat fails to reach the emotional peak the character needs to sell the ending. But thankfully there are some quiet scenes amidst the frenetic musical numbers. The voice actors are great, especially Jodi Benson as Ariel the title mermaid. From here the studio would go on to the even more impressive Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. Arguably their finest hour, it is undoubtedly one of their most impressive and creative tales.

I just received my ice cream maker two days ago and immediately put the freezer bowl to freeze, so that I could make some ice cream the next day. I made the basic vanilla ice cream and was very impressed with the results.

So far, I am very happy with this machine. Reminded us of Breyers ice cream, which is our favorite brand... Highly recommended!!!

I'd written in my review of Marvels that it was my favorite graphic novel of all time...I guess I hadn't read enough graphic novels.  The Watchmen is easily as good as Marvels, The Dark Knight Returns, or what have you.  This is a super-hero epic designed for adults who have a serious interest as comic books as an art form.  The term "graphic novel" is sometimes misapplied to over-blown comic books...that is not the case here.   Alan Moore is a great writer (arguably the best in the field) and, in The Watchmen, he has created a story of great depth, scope, and meaning.   I have discovered internet sites dedicated to pointing out the hidden subtexts and motifs of this book...they are not reading too much into it.  The task Moore sets for himself (as he often does) is to ask the question, "What would the world be like if super-heroes really existed?"  That question is more far-reaching than the average comic book implies.  The plot unfolds, not in a comic book way, but the way it might really happen.  The ending is completely original and totally unexpected.On a personal note, this book will forever be entwined in my mind with the events of September 11, 2001.   Some of the issues in the book cut a little too close to home.  But for me specifically, I'll remember staying up late the night before reading this book, and then being awakened by my roommates early the next morning to the scene of the World Trade Center in flames...and thinking that I'd read the comic for too long.   Things this terrible don't happen in the real world, only in comic books...right?

Pros:
It couldnt be easier to use.  You simply turn it on and press record when ready.  The downloading to the pc is insanely easy, just plug in the USB cord and all the software is preloaded on the recorder, so you just double click the .exe file and viola! its opened up with all your recently recorded videos.  Save them to hard disk and your done.  Very, very easy.  Battery and recording good for 2 HOURS!  Most of my filming has only been a few minutes at a time, but for a childs concert, vacation, etc.. there will surely be times for the 2 hours of recording ability.  Video quality is good, though read my Cons comment below.  Sound is good as well.  It's smaller than my blackberry phone and just as light.  Came with a nice rubber casing to protect it.
Cons:
This is a HD camcorder when you dont zoom in.  When you zoom, you will lose a good deal of video recording quality.

Conclusion:
I have used this about a dozen times in the past couple weeks for quick videos of my daughter in fun, spontaneous moments that a larger video camcorder would be to daunting to carry around therefore I would have missed these moments on video.  I paid a couple hundred dollars for this and it has already paid for itself in moments I will now never forget.

I enjoy using the pedometer but I found it difficult to get it programmed.  My son had to reprogram for me (that's nothing new)with the time, length of step, ect.(of course, he had to take out the battery in order to start over).  Also I have misplaced the little plastic clip thing that fits onto it so you can clip it onto your belt...I don't know how it slid off so easily but now I usually carry it in my pocket (if I have a pocket). The pedometer works really well at counting every step you take.  If you can program it, it is excellent. MC

I've purchased 4 of the 2 GB drives, and have been using them for about a month.  Size obviously is great.  Didn't realize that they are formated differently from other flash drives.  In Windows explorer, my Corsair 8GB flash drives shows up as FAT32, these show up just as FAT (don't know if it is FAT16 or what).  What I did find, with great pleasure, is that the 900 MB of files on my Corsair, copied over to under 300 GB on these!  I checked the file count and opened dozens of files to make sure everything was there, and it was!  Only down side I see with these drives is that they are a little slow compared to other flash drives.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)

      



Feeling jaded after having tried many so-called "health foods", I opened this product without much expectation. However, as I read the information on the package, noticing that the ingredients are few and natural (this product is labeled "USDA Organic") my hope rose again. After the first bite, I was hooked! The texture of this fruit snack is firmer than that of string cheese, and the taste is intensely fruity - almost reminding me of fruit wines. A closer inspection on the Nutrition Facts reveals that this snack is also rich with vitamins and minerals! I find it hard not to gobble down more than one of these fruit "ropes" at a time. In any case, I highly recommend this snack for children and adults alike.

I was worried my cat wouldn't take to the new litter, but he had no issues. This seems to work better than Litter Maid. We have a very large cat and LitterMaid would always get stuck and filled up so quickly. We have had this for 3 months so far, and so far we haven't had any problems. The litter seems to last between 2 and 3 weeks for our large cat. I can extend it a little by putting in some fresh litter on top.
All in all, this has been a pretty good product.

It's super-easy to use, and even easier to clean up! The grill plates can go in the dishwasher. I did some VERY thick pork chops and the griddler cooked them quickly and evenly. Floating hinge can accomodate at least 1" chops! Overall, I'm very impressed with the construction and operation of this grill--very well made and well-worth the money!

A great value for email and similar low-power programs in an ultra-portable package. The availability of XP was a big plus as I didn't want to switch to Vista.  I've also loaded Ubuntu on for a dual-booting system.  I've had some odd stuttering effects with sound in XP but re-setting to an earlier time took care of the problem.

I am now on my third one of these machines.  I use it twice weekly every week.  Seems to last somewhere between 4 and 5 years.  I have bought all 3 from Salton directly.  The first one in 1998 cost me $14.99; the one I bought last week also cost $14.99.
I've been looking for something with a lid to replace the container because I would prefer a container with an air proof lid once I place the yogurt in the refrigerator.  Thanks to the reviewer who suggested a 46 oz jar of apple sauce.
My usual method is to use half'nhalf and Yogourmet started which I can get for several places directly for about $3.60 for 10 starter packs. 1 pack makes 5 cups and the rather odd plastic container for the milk will hold 5 cups even thought it's marketed as 1 quart.
I use 4 cups of HnH and 1 cup water.  I heat it for 5 min and 45 secons on high in the microwave.  Any more time and it boils -- any less time and it doesn't reach the right temp.  I let the temp drop and then add the starter.
I usually incubate for 24 hours to eliminate all lactose -- I'll have to try the 34 hours mentioned.  I've noticed that placing a towel on top of the machine while it's incubating creates yogurt that has almost no tartness.  
The major difference I've noticed between microwaving and heating in a pot: microwaved yogurt always seems to have a harder surface and is set more at the end of 24 hours.

Wall e is designed to basically clean up the earth with the hope that mankind can return (the remains of mankind left the earth some years befroe the story takes place). Wall e becomes able to think freely and falls for another robot sent back to earth to check its progress. Together they set outto bring mankind back. Humor fun and emotion abound. a GREAT MOVIE

Please note, I'm writing this from the perspective of someone who used the Saitek X45 for 4 years, so most notes are comparing it, the X52 Pro, and the X52 standard.  I get rather nitpicky about individual features, so for those interested in the bottom line, you can skip most of this, and just read the last paragraph. :)

Compared with the standard X52, the X52 Pro is indeed a significant improvement.  All extra functionality of the multi-function display aside, the quality is simply higher.  However, I'm still very surprised that so many steps back were taken from the old X45.

Compared with the original X52, the spring tension in the stick of the X52 Pro is a great improvement.  I remember being very disappointed in the X52 when I picked up a display model, and the weak spring allowed the stick to fall over under it's own weight.  The X52 Pro added a second centering spring to help, and it is much better, but still rather weak compared with the X45, which had a massive spring.

Also, as with the standard X52, the X45's rudder rocker switch is gone, replaced by the twisty stick.  Now, I do understand this, since it is a common practice in joystick design now.. however, I have never seen an aircraft with this feature, and if realism is the goal, you'll need rudder pedals.  The rocker always has felt more intuitive to me.

I think my largest disappointment in this stick, and the standard X52, is the new style for the dials on the throttle.  In order to install the buttons in the centers of the dials, they had to sacrifice the quality of the dials themselves.  The X45 had wonderful dials, with a smooth rotation range of about 300 degrees around the circle, and a great feel.  The new style on the X52s is terrible by comparison.  The new dials are difficult to rotate due to their design (instead of actual knobs, they are now flattened cone shapes with very little grip of any kind), they are cut down to a range of motion of less than 180 degrees, and feel as if the mechanism is made entirely of plastic (which it actually appears to be, since the dials fall off easily, revealing a plastic construction).  A far cry from the well-oiled feel of the X45's dials.  While I do appreciate the extra buttons, they could have been placed elsewhere to save the quality of the dials.

Ok, that's enough ranting now.  I tend to be very picky, and these are things that stuck in my mind.  However, there are also several new features which I do appreciate greatly.

First, the extra buttons.  All told, there are at least 9 more buttons on this stick than the X45, including the toggle switches (which I very much appreciate- no more clogging the hat switches with flaps, landing gear, speedbrakes, etc.).  The new style hat and castle switches are a welcome change of design, as is the spring loaded "fire" button cover.  The new slider axis is very useful (although the feel of it leads me to believe it may become sloppy in the future), as is the mouse scroll wheel, and included button.  

Changing the mouse controller to a full two axis mini-stick is a mixed bag... it gives much more range of control of the mouse, but it also complicates things if you like to use it as a regular hat switch (just a matter of reprogramming).  Also, this mini-stick can get stuck, forcing your mouse cursor to keep moving after you let go.  This is particularly annoying since it can keep your screensaver from starting.  Also note that the mouse cursor is ALWAYS on, even with no profile applied.  With the default settings, you can simply use it as a two button mouse full time.  A setting to disable this, and turn it into a four or eight button hat would be nice.

The multi-function display (MFD) is a nice feature, but I have yet to really use it to any extent.  The radio stack capability in Flight Simulator X is nice.  It also has the ability to interact with Windows Media Player, displaying the current music track, and using the right wheel to control volume (note, it's backwards, and badly scaled- scroll up for volume down, and expect to scroll a long time before you notice a change).  Don't expect any more than that though, the other buttons don't do anything useful (like change tracks, pause, etc).  It may be possible to program these functions yourself, but using a multimedia keyboard is musch easier.

Overall, I'm not entirely happy that my X45 quit working finally, but I'm plenty happy with the X52 Pro.  It does everything I need it to do, and has been very accurate so far.  While there are a few things that could still use work in my opinion, they don't stop me from enjoying it.  I've used it in multiple games, and it has performed well in each of them.  At this point in time, the X52 series (I'd recommend the Pro version over the standard one, but the standard version is quite a bit cheaper) is probably the best bargain on the  market, since you can easily pay over $300 for the combination of a stick and throttle.

I'm writing this review for my wife and giving her impressions. I bought this for her for Christmas 2008 and we of course tested it to make sure it worked. I was a bit worried after reading the reviews, that she might not be able to tolerate the pain. But she handles full body waxing without any problems so I figured it's worth a shot.
We tried the head with the little prickly rollers as well as the head with the flat piece and the flat thing works better for my wife. Her biggest thing is it tickles her. We tried it on her arm first she barely noticed it, then we tried it on her leg and she felt it was a bit ticklish and then on her back, she squirmed a lot as it tickled her. The flat head tickles her less and grabs more hair. Then we tried it on her face, well that proved a bit more painful, so it took like 5 minutes to do her face, including sideburns. I figured ok, maybe it's not working very well..... no pain, no gain, right?!
So I tried it on my lower leg.......
Ok, well, THAT was a bad idea! I have very hairy legs and pretty long hair besides and Yes it works, and yes if you have long thick hair it hurts. My wife has a lot of fine hair so for her it's easy to use and being used to waxing she didn't think it was working but she could sort of feel the hair being tweezed. But the hair needs to be wiped off as this just throws the hair out of the unit. So a few bats with a dry towel and surprise no hair! Yes you do have to go over a spot a few times and I now wish we had bought the Braun SE7280 instead, as it looks like it would be easier to use on her back. I myself own a Braun 9595 razor and use it daily and love it. This Braun 5270 Epilator is the same rugged quality as my $200 Braun Razor.
If you have thick hair this is probably going to hurt, so the suggestions about getting the hair short and then using this seem like a good idea. But for my wife this is a breeze to use and no pain at all. Of course if you have very dark hair and light skin you can look into Laser Hair Removal but this is much cheaper and seems to work great and it's pretty quick except on her back. Of course I might not be doing her back right. I have a hard time waxing her back as it is. This is much much easier than waxing her back and much faster.
So she loves this and now it's boxed up until Dec 25th. But my wife, a Filipina, Highly Recommends this.

My refurbished pro 600 went kaput after 5 mos of mixing bread dough. KitchenAid ran out of the refurbished to replace my broken one and sent me a brand new pro 600 instead. That was beyond my expectations so return policy/customer service is great. But in 1 1/2 years, I had to return four (4) of these supposedly top of the line, professional duty. This machine CANNOT support bread making for very long. Like previous negative reviews, I think the plastic housing for the gears is the main problem. Needless to say, my original 4 qt classic mixer tolerated 13 years of constant bread making (and still going), but this heavy duty can barely make it into the 5th month. Its fine if it breaks within the warrantee time period, but if it waits until the year is over, you the buyer is out of luck.

Excellent key feel and weight. Feels sturdy and durable, not a cheap at all. The red glow looks fantastic and really makes it stand out. I got this board for a little under fifty dollars and i would say its worth every penny. I will say that the magnets did worry me a little but now that i have the board it doesnt seem as much of a problem as the previous reviewer has stated. I happen to have a razer mouse which comes in close proximity to the magnets and it works great still.I would think it odd for a company as big as microsoft to put magnets in a keyboard without testing it with mice and other common peripherals, so im not worried.

Accuracy is dead-on with my physician's readings, however this arm cuff is really frustrating to secure in proper position for a good reading - just very awkward to hold in place and use your other arm/hand to pull the cuff tight enough and velcro it together.  I swear my blood pressure goes higher just trying to get the darn thing on my arm properly! The wrist monitor I borrowed from my mother actually had very accurate readings and was much easier to affix.  Omron IS THE BRAND to get tho...

I have expensive dental work (crowns and a bridge) and I have always felt that the spin brush provided a good brush, but I never felt I could get it clean below the gum line. The Sonicare toothbrush is the best toothbrush I have ever owned. I just wish I had found it sooner. It leaves your whole mouth refreshed and it's true it feels like you've had your teeth cleaned at the dentist everyday. It's a totally different kind of clean. You just have to try it to understand. The price was the reason I waited so long, but trust me it is well worth it.

I've used different Norelcos since the 60's and finally tired of the progressively higher costs and consistantly slow shaves.  This Remington MS2-390 provides a quick close shave with little irritation if used with a light touch.  It is somewhat noisier than my old Norelco rotary but not enough to be a purchase consideration.  I like the rechargable/corded feature at this price point especially if I have forgotten to charge it.  The long run time is really great.  The on-off switch DOES stay on if fully pushed.  As others point out the trimmer is just for sideburns.  There was no instruction sheet with mine so I printed it from their web site.  Quick shipping by Amazon as usual.

This coffee maker makes a great tasting pot of coffee.  I went to a coffee house the other day, and thought their coffee wasn't nearly as good as what I make in this machine.  If you keep your coffee grounds in the refrigerator or freezer in an airtight container, your coffee grounds will remain fresh, thus helping make a better tasting cup of coffee to begin with.

The space to add water is small, you just have to pour it in slowly, and always make sure the lid is on the pot/under the basket correctly.  As for the condensation it holds on the lid where you add water/coffee, once my pot is done brewing, I lift the lid and hold it open with a round toothpick for a couple of hours until it dries, and there is no problem later on with water running down the back of the machine when you lift the lid.  Using the toothpick doesn't lift the lid completely, so nothing rolls down the back of the machine.

So far, my carafe has held up well.  I'm very careful with it, since the replacement carafe costs around $25.

I'd definitely recommend this machine.  Not only is the coffee great, it also has a 3 year warranty (I assume it still does, I bought my pot almost 2 years ago)

If anyone has doubts about the edurning magic of "The Wizard Of Oz" you must read this. This is the one film that since it's release in 1939 has remined the pivatal and favorite childhood fantacy. The film has such an unforgettable meaning to it and it reaches into the depth of ones deepest dreams and makes one realize that no matter what happens are where you are in the world, Home, family and friends are the most important things. Judy Garland starred as the little farmgirl who journeys to Oz to find just that the importance of Home. For it's day "The Wizard Of Oz" made history with it's special affects. It starts out in Black and White and then goes to the most incredable color that anyone has ever seen. If you have never seen this film then you must. There are such deep parts that it will make you cry. The music, the stars, the color and the story make this are truly magnificent masterpeice of the golden age of MGM musicals and you get to see why more than 33 years after her death Judy Garland is still one of the most beloved singers and actress's of all-time!

I applaud Microsoft for offering a low-cost alternative to the "full" Office packages, and nobody beats Amazon's prices!

After reading "The Happiest Baby on the Block" we knew that we wanted to swaddle our son at night but weren't completely comfortable doing so with blankets that could come undone and present a hazard.  We decided to try one of these despite the fact that other parents told us they didn't work well.  They have been wonderful for us!  When my son started to outgrow the small size, we decided to try the Miracle Blanket next.  It was such a pain to take on and off and to re-wrap him in when changing him in the middle of the night.  We then ordered more of the SwaddleMe's in the large size and haven't used anything else since.  My son sleeps in this every night and only rarely is able to get an arm out...and even when he does get an arm out, there is no danger because the SwaddleMe is still velcroed up.  I strongly recoomend this product and don't know what I would do without it!

This is an excleent product, but it is not a miracle worker.  In other words, you need to use the stuff properly.  (1) this product is water resistant...not soap resistant.  So if you use this stuff then go and use some of that heavily perfumes soapy shampoo that msot people use..then you are washign it right off.  (2) if you chose to bathe your dog..bathe him/her first then wait 2-3 days THEN apply the product so that it will be distrubited properly.  (3) Remember that if you have a heavy flea problem that you need to treat the pet and the environment.  You can't jsut put it on the dog and not get rid of the fleas in your house, car, yard, etc.. Yeah it will kill the fleas on him/her, but they will get reinfested with fleas everytime they go back into the flea filled environment.  This is the only product that I use for my dog.  Of you purchase ANYTHING over the counter (biospot, hartz ::shudders::, etc) then you are wasting your money.  Flea dips work, but they only kill the fleas that are on the dog when you bathe him/her.  Frontline PLUS is great becasue it keeps killing for up to a month.  Also, Frontline Plus has a better range of killing fleas than plain ole' Frontline.  The "PLUS" means that it kills larvae and eggs and so much more than adult fleas.  IF USED CORRECTLY and ROUTINELY this is an EXCELLENT product!!!  I highly recommend it. This product also kills ticks.

I usually am not too motivated to read books all that much, but this is one that is truly great.  I used to teach and if I still were I would totally use parts of this book to illustrate just how the Founders and early America believe. Many argue that the founders were totally anti-religion, and in some ways that is true, but they did believe in a higher monotheistic power that help CREATE God's laws.  Also this book just give better enlightenment into the specifics of what the branches of each gov't should be.  If you are a college professor you should at least read this to be OPEN minded.

I am using the SlingCatcher to "catch" both digital cable from a vacation home located two hours away on a different cable system as well as using the Sling Projector on my computer in another room of the house to project videos and televisions shows that I may have missed onto my HDTV.  The setup is pretty straightforward and easy.  After hearing that Sony had dropped plans to release the Location Free products for placeshifting, I was pretty bummed out.  However, Sling definitely picked up where Sony could have been a leader and took over the market allowing you to now watch your video on any television and not just on your computer or mobile device with this product.  Watching Internet video directly on my widescreen television is a huge benefit for me.

My 11 year old rescue American Bull Dog "Tyson" came to me with no hair on his tail and balding patches on his butt and shoulders. After a month of using these, the hair on his tail started growing back. After two months, his tail was full bushy and all his bald spots were gone. I ran out of these for a month and now his tail is starting to loose hair again. I'm pretty convinced that the Fats in these treats were doing the trick for solving his hair loss. Another benefit of these is their consistancy. You can stuff pills in them and "re-mold" the treat back together (Some treats are not good for pilling, this one is). These are pretty big, but they also break in half easy for giving to small dogs (they are about three times the size of a soft liver treat). As far as the joint-formulation effectiveness, I reall cant say yet...my cattle dog has bad arthritis so I've been giving them to her also, but I haven't seen much improvement in her gait, but then again, I don't expect short term miricles when it comes to homiopathic solutions. Hope This helps your doggie!

I first read it at 15 years old when it first came out - and i loved it for its ground-breaking and innovative aspect, at a time of stereotyped single-minded super-heroes. 
I read it again as a mature man and still liked it very very much - but now im able to understand the whole phylosophical theme and political critics, the deep psychological analysis of men and society - and the story is still the great sci-fi thriller that kept my full attention as a teenager.
A must read for anyone serious about comics - it changed my perception of adult comic book potential impact - Watchmen can be an artwork as truly inspiring and disturbing as a picasso or dali picture, a chaplin movie or a Dante book.

The yard is preassembled and ready to use out of the box.  

It is a bit difficult to open and close the "doors" so we end up striding over them.  

It is easy to turn the play yard into a protective fence around undesirable parts of the house  - very helpful function.

It is very easy to move the yard around unless it is fastened to the wall, but so far this has been a life saver for our little one. A few times there were some tumbles against the plastic gates, but most of these would have been significantly more dangerous without it.  

On the design - it looked garish, but we hung a number of toys on the gate and it looked much more kid friendly and interesting for our little man.  

Large enough for an 18 pounder to roam - we are waiting to see how much use we get out of this now that he has learned to pull himself up to a standing position and to march around the gates holding on them.   Although the entire construction shakes it supports him quite well so far.

I'll try and give a good review on my initial thoughts.

First, I have to admit when I went looking for (and ended up finding) my next nose hair trimmer the one I ended up with made me feel like I was going back in time. I mean come on, MANUAL powered? No batteries? No
charger?

How can this thing be any good?

I kept going back over the reviews, making sure that yes... this was
the ONE they were all talking about. Sure enough, it was... so I
tucked my disbelief and shrugged with a a silent 'What the heck'.

Fast forward to today.

Initial thoughts... Feels heavy, well made... packaging is mom and pop
style welcoming you in a friendly/neighborly way, the way people do
when they're going to be around for the long hall. Still had to look
for a battery compartment, no luck... only a manual turning mechanism,
lower shaft rotates the blades on top.

Who cares, get on with it... what's up?

Thing works! I intentionally left my nose alone in order to
give this a run for it's money... in no time, and what seemed like no
effort - my nose is better looking than it has been since mother
nature played this evil trick on me. The best part is, (other than it
works) is that there is no annoyance what-so-ever (well short of
having a metal object in your nose). No buzzing, no vibration, no
pulling... etc.

Very satisfied, order one!

It really did take just a few minutes to set up since it's a fold and carry model. Very sturdy construction. My Schnoodle jumped right inside! During the day, I keep both doors open because he likes to pop in and out of it. He sleeps in it at night. Great way to housebreak a dog.

Some specifications--

DOOR OPENINGS:
The one on the longer side (24"), the opening is 12" wide, 15" high.
On the shorter end (18"), the opening is approx 14" x 14". 
Doors swing to the left, and each door has two latches for extra security.

TWO PLASTIC HANDLES snap on and off and can be placed on the sides of the crate or on the top (depending on the weight of the dog). 

PLASTIC PAN is removable, therefore can be easily cleaned if your furry friend leaves a "present".

One thing I did notice was that one of the metal pieces that connected one side of the crate to the bottom stuck out a bit. It may be just the construction of this particular one, but keep your eye out for sharp edges. I have his blanket in there for now, but am contemplating a cover /mattress/ bumper set (made specifically for crates) to make sure my little guy's cozy and safe.

I too was considering an electronic self-cleaning litterbox, until I read all the negative reviews.  Came upon this one, and the reviews were glowing, so I tried it.

First slight disappointment -- the picture on the listing shows a green and tan box, which looks fairly nice.  What arrived was a blue and silver thing that looks cheap and a bit gaudy.  Other reviewers were right in that the Omega Paw is VERY cheaply made.  The plastic is thin, even warped in places.  The tabs haven't broken for me yet, but I can see they probably will.  I wish they'd used a better-gauge plastic -- even slightly thicker would be an improvement.

I was concerned about the size -- I have a larger cat, and purchased the regular-size litterbox -- but she's taken to it just fine.  Keep in mind that with the interior grille divider, the usable area of the box is just over half its inside size.

I suppose it does work -- mostly.  But here's what happens often for me: the "grille" that filters the clumps from the litter, has slats that angle down.  This facilitates the litter going through as you roll it.  However, these slats or louvres also snag the clumps.  Smaller clumps, especially the marble-sized fecal ones, get caught in the slats.  I find that I have to roll it back and forth several times, and often bang on the bottom to dislodge the stuck clumps.  I've sometimes had to take off the lid and scoop manually, which is way more hassle than my previous litter box was.

Second caveat: unless you can place the box where it has a couple feet of space on either side, you'll have to move it around to do the rolling.  In a NYC apartment, space is a premium, so the box is tucked away in the kitchen.  When it's cleaning time, I have to lug it out into the open and find enough room to roll it around, then put it back.

So far, I've come in contact with more litter, dust, and unsanitary stuff using this box, than I did just scooping out my previous one.  There's probably a technique I haven't mastered yet, and I really do want the box to work.  When it does, it is terrific.

First off, the kids can definitely use the compact ones as they are that small, however, I find I actually like using the compact ones as well.  After brushing with the compact brush I feel the small nooks and crannies of your gums are cleaned better.

At first, I thought I had made a mistake by purchasing this unit as opposed to the Timex heart rate monitor that's advertised here at Amazon. The problem was that I was initially getting mixed results with the heart rate reading when going for a bike ride. What I discovered was that if you use a little bit of Aloe Vera Gel on the transmitter 'contact points', it will instantly solve the problem. Other than this initial issue, it has been a great training tool and I highly recommend it for any one requiring a basic heart rate monitor.

I use it twice a day chopping tough vegetables sometimes running it for two or three minutes.  The feet are wider than the non-pro beehive and the motor does not have the high pitch whine of the non-pro model.  I wish I had known about the pro model before since the standard ones give out after a few years.

I was extremely pleased with the delivery of this item and the item itself.  It works wonderful.
My internet server was offering a free wireless modem and I decided I needed a laptop.  Now I don't even have to leave the comfort of my chair.  Although I'm not sure that's a good thing.
I really can't rave about all the benefits of this computer because I'm not the most computer savvy person but it has done everything I've asked of it and more.  I'm sure the more I use it, the more I'll love it.

We bought this blender after a recommendation from a friend.  It works wonderfully to make baby food for our (now 10 month old) son.  We take whatever we have cooked ourselves for dinner and blend it up for him.  It's great for traveling because it fits in the diaper bag and easy to clean too!  Would definately recommend one to anyone who has a baby!

Excellent for anyone who would like to have a powerful laptop at a very easy to carry and remarkable price.  The small screen is easy to get used to.  You may adjust the page size and of course their is a magnifier when needed.  But I find that with the correct page size, the 8.9 inch screen is no problem.  The 6 cell battery holds a charge for more than 5 hours, which is really a plus.  Excellent for travel (buy the pocketed carry case (offered through Amazon affiliate) or just away from your desktop (kitchen, bed, etc.); very convenient  Besides, we all know that Acer makes a fine product.  I love my Acer One.

After using a Braun KF400 coffee maker for a number of years, I decided to look for an alternative that was smaller, faster and easier to clean.  I am the only coffee drinker in my household, so I rarely made a full pot with the Braun.  At home, I would generally make coffee on the weekends (the coffee at work is fine) and would pour from the pot into an insulated mug.  So the idea of brewing right into the insulated mug was appealing.

Enter the Black and Decker DCM18S.  The mug holds 15.5 ounces of java, which was about what I was making in the Braun.  I've owned the machine about 3 weeks now and have made coffee about 8 times.  Personally, I find that 2 level coffee scoops work well for a full mug.  I ordered from Amazon after failing to find the product in either Target, Linens `n Things or Bed Bath and Beyond.

I find the taste on par with the Braun, although I'd probably give the Braun a slight edge.  The convenience of the DCM18S was worth the switch.  Just simply fill the reservoir to the full line, put the coffee into the permanent filter, put some milk in the mug, cover the mug and press the ON switch.  The coffee will flow off the lid, into the mug.  You can also keep the lid off if you want to add sugar and stir. I don't use sugar, so putting the lid on while brewing helps keep the temperature high.

Clean up is easy.  Just empty the filter of the grinds, rinse the filter, and clean out the mug.  With the Braun, I had to clean the pot and the two piece cover, plus the mug.  Also, the Braun's warming plate was hot, so I'd usually put a little water in the pot and return it to the plate while it cooled down.  Otherwise, someone could get burned because they wouldn't know the plate was still hot.  With the DCM18S, there is no hot plate, so there's no risk of getting burned by it.  

I did try using a Melitta #1 paper filter instead of the permanent filter once.  It was a little small for two scoops of coffee, so there is a chance that the grinds could spill over the filter and into the coffee.  In my one test, I didn't get grinds in the coffee, but the permanent filter rinses out easily enough and you save the expense of paper filters.

A couple of minor gripes.  While the handle on the mug is comfortable, the body of the mug is somewhat hot if you hold it in hand.  The other gripe is that the fill line inside the reservoir is hard to read.  I have a Brita water pitcher so I want to pour from the pitcher direct into the reservoir, and avoid pouring into the mug first.

Overall, I'm quite pleased with the Brew `N Go.  My rating is closer to 4.5 stars, but because of the quibbles and the fact that the taste of the Braun gets a slight edge, I chose 4 stars instead of 5.  

Update 8/13/2006:  After using the DCM18S for about 9 months, I began having a problem where the grinds would wind up in the coffee.  I use two coffee scoops, but this wasn't a problem earlier.  I'm not sure whether this is caused by the water overflowing or caused by the pulsing steam at the end of the process.  Either way, it has happened enough lately that I took out my old Braun and "retired" the Black and Decker.

I have always heard glowing reviews about Macs and how superior they are to PCs. After my PC was struck by what appeared to be a power surge, I decided it was time to finally make the switch. I loved my PC dearly and could have spent a lot to fix it, but I figured it was time. I must say, after even using it for the first time, I realized it definitely was time! I have had my MacBook (White, 13", 2.4GHz, 2 GB RAM, 250 GB Hard Drive) for a month, and I am already converted. Stunningly designed, fast and easy to use. I originally wanted to hold out for the Pro, but since the difference was much more than I could afford, and I needed something right away, I opted for this little beauty. I am not sorry in the slightest! I love the bright 13" screen. It's not too big or small, it's just right. I can read the fonts easily and the size is perfect for taking places or storing. It's quiet and I don't feel that it overheats too easily. It certainly cools off quickly after hours of use. I love how clean it looks, the white is elegant. The two finger scroll is pretty cool. Of course not as cool as Multi-Touch, but I can get over that. I still need to figure out all of the goodies it has to offer, but so far this Mac fits all of the basics I need for school and fun. Highly recommended! You'll wonder what took you so long!

I highly recommend this model and make to any one who wants the best for their feline.. The price is well placed and the filters are also rather inexpensive compared to other models

UPDATE 9/16/2008: Sorry to report that my AA1 is going back today. I was unable to connect to wireless at my house and I think it has to do with compatibility with my wireless router at home. I have DLink at home and haven't been able to connect to it. My laptop did connect to wireless connections from Netgear and Linksys routers. All of my other laptops never had that problem and connected to my DLink without a glitch. I don't feel like buying a new router so I think Acer dropped a ball on router compatibility here. Another two problems that haunted me were: 1) the high pitched fan noise and 2) the overheating of the unit. Although earlier I said the noise, although audible, did not bother me, I take that statement back. It became quite annoying and even though I tried the modification from the AA1 user forums, it didn't fix it completely, the fan would still kick in quite frequently and with a vengeance. Another issue I found even before the fan utility was installed, is that the keyboard would get quite hot to the touch. All in all, I am disappointed to return my now 2nd AA1, but these 3 issues: wireless problems, fan noise, and overheating are a dealbreaker for me.

UPDATE 08/29/2008: Received my new Acer Aspire One today. Wow, one day shipping from J&R rocks! The blue AAO with Win XP looks just like the Linux version: there is the SD "Storage Expansion" slot on the left side and a multi-format card reader on the right, 3 USB ports, etc. It boots up pretty fast and runs the so familiar WIN XP OS. I liked the Linux graphics, but to be honest, as a Windows user, I felt lost. So far, I haven't had any problems with the wireless (knock on wood) that I have experienced when I used the Linux version.  Yes, you can hear the fan, as some of the reviewers have mentioned, BUT, it is not nearly as annoying as they claim. I can live with that. The Hard Drive is listed as 120GB, however, it shows up as 105 GB. The windows XP version comes with a 60-day trial of MS Office 2007 and McAfee Security Suite. Curiously, it also comes with InterVideo WinDVD, although, as you are aware, there is no DVD drive. Other programs included are: MS Works, Adober Reader 8, IE, MSN, Windows Media Player, Windows Messenger, Windows Movie Maker, Acer eRecovery Manager. I installed Firefox without a glitch. So far, I am very pleased with the laptop. It's not a $2,000 Sony or Mac, but it's a great value. It does what it is supposed to do. I am glad I returned the Linux and ordered the Windows. It works better for my needs.

UPDATE 8/28/2008: So, Amazon dropped the price on Acer Aspire One with Linux OS. However, the Win XP version continues to be overpriced compared to other online retailers. I've decided to order the blue Win XP machine directly from J&R for $369.99 and will get an additional 15% off via Live Search Cashback (total price after cashback excluding shipping: $314.41). I decided to go back to the familiar XP configuration simply because I believe that learning Linux will involve too much effort to justify the cost. In addition, the Linux version of Acer Aspire One appears to have more wireless bugs than Windows. We'll see how the Win XP netbook performs.

UPDATE 8/25/2008. So far I haven't seen any price reductions by online retailers. I think they are waiting to purge their inventory. Best Buy, however, does have the blue Acer Aspire One with 1gb Ram, 120 gb HD and Win XP Home for $349.99. So far they are the first ones to jump on the Acer price drop bandwagon. 

UPDATE 8/20/08. Acer just (4 hrs ago) made the announcement on Market Watch that it will slash the prices for Acer Aspire One to $349 for Win XP and $329 for Linux. I miss my Acer One and will order one again as soon as retailers update their prices. I thought it was a great deal for $379 but for $50 less it's an absolute bargain. I do hope that I won't have anymore wireless problems with this one. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I had purchased this laptop from another online retailed in blue with Linux. I really liked Acer Aspire One from the moment I pulled it out of the box. It's very compact, light, elegant, boots in no time (20 sec). I am a first-time Linux user and was actually pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use. I followed the instructions from one of the Amazon reviews here to unlock the full OS and was able to add Skype (Fedora version) without a problem. OpenOffice is very straightforward and easy to use, email setup was a breeze. I plugged it into my cable modem and loved the very fast web page loading times. All in all, it's a great little laptop alternative, the screen is easy to read, the keyboard size is adequate for error-free typing, the trackpad took some getting used to but it was fine within a couple of hours.

Now to the negatives:
-the surface is very prone to fingerprint smudges
-the screen is very glossy and reflective, but the brightness compensated for the fact that I could always see my reflection on the screen
-the left and right mouse buttons are oddly positioned on either side of the keyboard, so that takes some getting used to
-now last but not least - wireless connectivity problems. I've had the Acer Aspire One for over a week and have tried every single approach out there to get the wireless connection on it. the wireless networks would show up on the connection manager, but when I would attempt to connect to a particular network I would get an error message saying connection was terminated. One of the networks I tried to connect to was my own home wireless network which successfully worked for all of my other laptops. I tried the WEP protocol - no success, I changed the router settings to WPA - tried to connect - no success, I changed it to the open network - no success although I am sure my neighbors appreciated the open net access they could steal from me in the interim. I've searched the web for a solution and found out that this wireless problem seems to be an issue for a number of Acer Aspire One users out there. Some were able to fix it by running Live Update on a wired connection (I did it, but it didn't fix the problem), some played with sleep modes, reboots, etc. None of that worked for me. I tried to look up this issue on the Acer website, but their customer support is not very user friendly. So, I gave up, called the merchant for an RMA# and am returning the Acer Aspire One today. I wish it had worked as I liked it so much, but it's no use to me without wireless connections and I believe that if I purchase a brand new item, it has to be fully operational straight out of the box. So, goodbye my dear sapphire blue Acer Aspire One, you will be missed, I hope your maker solves the wireless problem and I will buy you again when that happens. I would recommend this product without reservation if only the wireless problem is resolved.

I bought this with some skepticism and only because my dental hygienist kept making such great claims during previous visits about how it keeps the teeth and gums healthier. I just had my first six month cleaning and checkup since using this thing, for four months, and it was the best I've ever had, no bleeding and little plaque. I believe its because of the Sonicare because everything else I did the same as before. 

My gums did bleed a little the first few times I used this, it takes a bit to get used to it, especially the tickling feeling on the tongue and gums but its worth it.

My husband and I used this in the hospital from the very start. It was absolutely wonderful. The baby slept so soundly. We were unable to wrap our son like the nurses do in those blankets, so we used the swaddle instead. The nurses were even going on and on about how nice it was. The fleece material makes the baby very cozy for the cool hospital environment. 

We continued to use it at home every night. My son is just over 5 months and is just now outgrowing it to the point where he can "escape" it after a short time. I now give this gift to all my friends having babies. My mom gives it as a gift as well. We all witnessed how great it worked. My son was able to wear the small the whole time because he is fairly thin weighing only 15 lbs as of 22 weeks. There is a big jump between the small and the large. The large still swallows him whole like the small did him as a newborn. You must have this swaddle. It creates a peaceful sleeping baby! It also prevents the baby from rolling over when you prefer them to sleep on their back.

I really do find this coffee maker to be of a good quality.I have had it for a few weeeks now and it makes the coffee within approximitly 3-4 minutes.It carafe keeps it hot for several hours,and it pours well.I have had many types including bunn and I find it works as well as a bunn.the part you put the coffee in instead of it just swinging open to the side it has to be lifted off on on side to make the other side swing open,thats a little inconvienent,but I also know over a period of time if it wasn't made like that a leaking dissater could occur.So I would reccomend the coffee maker.The other draw back is its made in China I wasn't aware of that.

I saw this at a local theater with my co-worker friend on a very rainy day while on a two and a half hour lunch from work (ok, we played hooky).  It was the first show of the first day that this film was released.  I think there were about 30 people in the theater.  I had to wait 2 weeks to let my "giddies" subside enough so that I could write a somewhat coherent review.  I've gotten in the habit of writing in little, categorized chapters.  Here goes;

THIS FILM ROCKS!!!.....
   Sorry about that.  I promised myself I would never do that.  I can't seem to help myself.  This might be the most excited I have ever been about a movie since seeing "Star Wars" nearly 32 years ago.  Not even "Lord of the Rings" got me this stoked (and I love that series).   I read an interview with Director, Jon Favreau in the Detroit Free Press.  He described his initial meeting with ILM at their facilities.  In a conference room full of ILM staff and notables he uttered these words; "I hate CGI".  As you would guess they were quite stunned.  It's because of this attitude that Favreau is quickly becoming my favorite Hollywood Director ( "Zathura" was also surprisingly good).  His belief in using practical effects whenever possible is leading to more realistic and believable films than most of his peers.  Of course, his desire to see really cool and smart movies (like most people) does not hurt.  He really has faith in his audience and it pays off tremendously.

THIS FILM ROCKS!!
  Pardon me!!  MAN, 0 for 2!   I'm being completely honest when I say this; by the time Stark invents his first "Iron" suit to break out of his prison, this had already become my favorite live action superhero movie.  That was roughly half way through.  The film could have ended there and I would have been completely satisfied.  But wait, there is so much more.  We spend the next 3rd of the film watching him transform technically and personally, and it is a joy.  But wait, there is more.  We get to laugh at his failures and impulsive behavior, and it is a joy.  But wait, there is more.  He starts to save the world, one person at a time and it is spectacular and... ...it is a joy.  But wait!!  Well, you get the picture.  By the time the final climactic battle comes around, you might think it was unnecessary; however, it is a joy

THIS FILM ROCKS!!!
OK!!  Now it's just getting annoying!!  Despite the great visual FX and the outstanding action and nearly perfect story, it is the characters that make this film.  I have never been a huge fan of any of the actors in this film.  I thought they were ok but never was too wowed.  Now, I am having a serious case of man-love for Robert Downey Jr.. I thought his casting as Tony Stark was a good idea before seeing the film.   Now I'm convinced it was pure genius.  Gwyneth Paltrow's secondary role as Pepper Potts (assistant savant) actually stood out.  She brought a huge amount of depth and realism to a fringe character; impressive.  The rest of the characters/actors were equally believable and performed above my expectations.  Again, I think this speaks of masterful direction.

THIS FILM RO....
That's enough!!  This is the first solo film production from Marvel Entertainment.  HUGE KUDOS!!  They obviously know their core product much better than the Hollywood regulars.  They recently announced their plans through 2011.  In the next few years we will get to see a new and hopefully better Hulk, Captain America, Mighty Thor, more Iron Man and Nick Fury; Agent of SHEILD.  All of these films will be connected in some way and seem to be pointing at a culmination in an "Avengers" film.  If Marvel keep their focus and stick to what worked so brilliantly in "Iron Man" we are all in for a real treat!! 

A WORD TO PARENTS
There is one sex scene in this film.  It's a bit rough (physically speaking). Though no real nudity occurs it might be more than you'd like your kids to see.  Some of the violence could be too intense for younger or sensitive kids

Did I mention that THIS FILM ROCKS!?!?!?  Just checking.

GREAT machine, with one exception, which i discovered on a trip recently when i went to use dial-up to connect to the www.  THERE IS NO MODEM! don't know why i didn't notice before, perhaps because specs above falsely state there is.  anyway, must buy an external (very small) usb plug in 56K modem for circa $45, i insist on having dialup capability (hey, it ALWAYS WORKS, tho slow, and useful only for email. but when your dsl or t1 goes down, dialup ALWAYS WORKS)(did i say that it ALWAYS WORKS?)  BUT GREAT MACHINE, all i wanted, cool, cool, cool.  no flaws and well thought out, always a pleasure to experience good design and execution (except that the damn targus external cd/dvd is 1) at $149 half the cost of the computer, thus way too high, and 2) READ ONLY, ie no writing.  but this is a netbook, you shouldn't be copying CDs or DVDs on this machine anyway.) GREAT MACHINE!!!!!!  BTW, they offer another acer aspire one with a 10.1" screen now, careful comparing of specs and dimensions and viewing of pics reveal same keyboard just wider and taller case by about one-half inch in toto in each dimension to get (on the diagonal) 1" more screen and to put touchpad buttons at bottom like some losers have been complaining about on this machine.  slightly heavier (wouldn't be noticable) and $20 more. exact same innards and specs (incl NO MODEM).  make sure you buy the right size carry case, etc.        but i like this one.  SWEET. also, re the "form factor" of the 6 cell larger battery, it really adds a useful handle to the machine, and ain't at all too big or protruding. i prefer it, esp considering the doubling of time you gain. GREAT MACHINE, soooo much nicer than the HP mini (and i am an HP fan). a home run, maybe with bases loaded - GRAND SLAM!

Meet Mick St. John, private detective, who happens to have a special talent...he is a vampire.  A very reluctant one, however.  Mick uses his accelerated senses (which describes have been turned up to 11) to help solve his cases.  He had one particular case 22 years earlier which changed his life; the abduction of a little girl.  I'm not going to spoil everything by going into detail of who abducted her; you'll just have to watch it for yourself.  But, the little girl is now grown up, and he stays close by to watch over her...and the chemistry between the two is something else.

This is my second WD drive and I must say they have not disappointed me one bit. The quietness and durability of these drives are awesome in my opinion. I have own them for over a year and no problem whatsoever. If you really need a large storage external drive, WD is the way to go.

If I need another drive, I would not hesitate to buy another external hdd from WD again. Go Western Digital !!

This is not a cheap coffee maker but it's been a great value for me as I rarely go to coffee shops anymore.  I love the huge variety of K-Cups available, though you do need to order online to find the obscure flavors and companies.  I'm a fan of variety so I really enjoy being able to have a different flavor of coffee every day.  The bonus is that you can use the special "My K-Cup" filter to enter in your own ground coffee, which is a good way to save money.  The machine also looks great in my modern kitchen.

One negative I haven't seen other reviewers mention is the timer.  There is no separate weekday and weekend setting for the timer.  So it's a pretty useless feature if you don't wake up at the same time every day.  Nobody wants to hear the loud rumbling of the machine warming up at 7 am on a Sunday morning.

Other than this minor issue, I'm very happy with the machine and would buy another one if this one ever breaks down.

I hate to say how much I paid for this zip drive in a big box score but it was way over 15 dollars. I save a lot of my data on these nowadays after my hard drive crashed last year. The 8 GB is key for me because videos take up a lot of space. One or two GB won't do it if you're posting videos online. I bought mine about two months ago and have had no problems. I agree with the other reviewers and the price is absolutely awesome.

I never thought that my hard drive would crash, and that I would lose all my photos, bank records, and important documents.  But guess what...it did and I lost everything!  So, I learned a lesson the hard way...back up your data!  My son and friends recommended the WD MyBook external drive (500GB) as the best back up drive for the money.  Amazon's price was the best around and the free shipping sealed the deal for me. It arrived in perfect condition within a few days after I placed my order.  I am not a techie, but it was really easy to install. Just plug it in and the software takes care of the rest.  Within minutes, I was backing up my photos and files. It couldn't have been easier.

I purchased this trimmer over a month ago, and it works very well. I use the vacuum on the high setting. I have seen people complain about the height setting moving to the minnimum setting; however, I do not know how they manage to do that without actually TURNIG the adjustment ring. I tried to press this trimmer so as to force a change in the setting and was unable to do so. This trimmer is excellent for my purposes... The vacuum works very well, and the cut is even with NO pulls on my hairs. I highly recomend this trimmer... Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer.

First off, I really love this product.  It's the quickest, easiest way to swaddle my baby girl, who sleeps much better at night when she's securely wrapped up.  We went with this kind of swaddle over a blanket because she has been a "mobile sleeper" since birth, and always managed to wriggle out of our blanket swaddle.  Note that these notes below pertain to the small size.

Now - here's what you need to know about sizing, based on my three months of experience and multiple attempts to get it right.  
- There are three kinds of swaddle fabrics at the time I'm writing this:
1. Flannel (in the gingham prints)
2. Fleece
3. Cotton jersey (like a t-shirt).  This variety has the most options in terms of patterns and colors.

I've arranged them in that order because that's the order of smallest to largest.  The flannel variety stretches, well, not at all. It's the smallest of the three types of fabrics, therefore, in terms of fit.  (My daughter outgrew her small size swaddle at 13 pounds, after washing it a few times - even though it's supposed to fit up to 14.)  The fleece variety does stretch a bit - she's now 15 pounds and this still fits her.

The cotton variety is the stretchiest one - and it REALLY stretches.  The first time after I wash and dry it, it's pretty snug.  But if I'm lucky enough to get 2 or 3 nights of use out of it, by the third night it's considerably bigger than it was.  I just bought another small cotton one and my baby's 15 pounds.  

What's more, I just bought a flannel gingham swaddle in large, and that fits her great.  (But the cotton variety in large was HUGE and I'm returning it.)  Anyway - hope this is helpful to all of you out there.  This is a great product and I wish you luck!

I have tried a few different brushes on my 70-pound Australian Shepherd/Rottweiler mix, but nothing works like the FURminator.  It really does do a great job of getting the loose hair off him to reduce shedding in the home.  And for the prices you can get this for on Amazon, you can't beat it.

The griddler works great.  The controls are intuitive and clearly marked.  The grill plates heat up quickly, and are easy to remove and clean.  The bottom plate is positioned with its right front corner slightly lower so that grease drains easily through the provided opening.  The top plate sits firmly and at the proper angle directly on the items being grilled.  Having flat and ribbed plates provides the ability to use the unit as both a grill and a griddle.

The only warning I would give is that foods cooks more quickly than the estimates provided.

All in all, this is the best grill for the money available.

I just bought the medium sized Furminator at a retail petstore today and although I was initially skeptical (and a little annoyed by the high price), it does REALLY work.  

I bought the Furminator because we recently adopted an Aussie mix and at 4 months old is already shedding fluffy undercoat that sticks to everything.  I brought the Furminator home, brushed her while she wiggled around trying to chew on the new expensive brush and pretty soon I had a sizeable mound of soft fluffy puppy undercoat.  She's not too big yet, but I expect to get $$ worth once she starts to grow (did I mention that she's 1/4 Malamute?)!

What I didn't expect, is the fantastic results I had on our three SHORT haired cats.  Sure, they do their fair share of shedding, but I don't really think of them as having an undercoat to brush out.  I had just brushed all of them yesterday with one of those standard cat slicker brushes and ended up with small balls of fur from each of them.  Well, I decided to try the new Furminator on the cats too (just for fun) and OH MY GOD, the fur flew off of them!  I ended up with a pile of fur (squished down) big enough to FILL the bathroom sink...and that was from just one cat who was already "brushed" (or so I thought)!

I then tried it on our other dog, a pit bull mix with a short, stiff "single" coat.  The Furminator actually took out little short fluffy hairs that I didn't even know she had!  While she dosen't really need it, she gets brushed too because otherwise she's jealous of her little sister!

The nice thing about this brush is that it dosen't cut the hair, it just grabs loose undercoat and pulls it out.  I've seen other de-shedding brushes that actually have a razor in them that cut the hair out which can damage the coat.  The Furminator did actually leave their coats nice and shiny.  And...all three cats and both dogs didn't seem to mind it at all.  In fact, two of my cats that don't like being brushed rolled over purring while I was brushing.

One slight negative is the amoung of static that builds up, especially when brushing the cats.  With every pass of the brush there was a small "snap" of static and the fur then just wants to stick all over you, the brush and the cat.

The other reason I didn't give the product 5 stars is because of the price.  For a brush, it is pricey at almost $50 (retail).  But, I guess if you invent a product that works that well, people will pay for it even if it is a bit expensive.  It will save us from having to take the new puppy to the groomer in the future and should cut down on the amount of fur around the house.  Overall, an excellent product.

Why can't everything in life be as easy as setting up a Linksys WRT54GL router???  I'm no genius when it comes to electronics/computers/etc.  That's what my brothers are for.  I only purchased this because of the great reviews on Amazon AS WELL AS on NewEgg and felt like if I ever did drastically improve my technological expertise, this might give me all the options I have no idea what to do with today.  I went with super saver shipping and received my order in only maybe 3 days from my order date.  Yay!  I expected at least SOME confusion when setting this up but "O-M-G!" the instructional CD was so easy I thought there's no way I could be set up and secure already!  On top of that, best signal I've ever had.

Personally, the first 20 minutes without dialogue were the most engaging, creative, and humorous.  Once the story hit space, it became quite prosaic, with much of the activities and dialogue onboard being straight out of other stories, and nonetheless with several logical holes, even for a kid's movie.  The return to earth was strictly formulaic and feel good as well.  Despite this, still a respectable, sweet, and humorous tale.

I bought this to replace another Norelco beard trimmer with a dead battery.  The T980 works well for me, using the shortest setting (3 day stubble, I think).  The vacuum feature is good, keeps the mess to a minimum, but not perfect.  It holds a charge for a few weeks (based on using it 2 x week, 5 min each), recharges quickly, works with or without the cord.  My only complaint is the size of the trimmer head.  It's pretty large, and the blades are set back about 1/2 inch from the edge, so it's hard to get close in some areas (nose and ears).

When I first heard of NCIS, my immediate reaction was, "Oh no, not another investigative show!" Programs such as CSI, Cold Case, and Without a Trace have never impressed me; I find many of the characters bland, and though the cases themselves may be good, it's a show's cast that sells it for me. 

Luckily, NCIS does the opposite: the formula comprises of characters first, crime second, and the show is embedded with such wit and humor that it's hard not to like it. The cast includes sarcastic Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon); ladies-man Tony DiNozzo (the highly attractive Michael Weatherly); witty Kate Todd (Sasha Alexander) to provide amusing banter with Tony; goth Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette); and M.E. Donald "Ducky" Mallard (David McCallum), who has a passion for storytelling. Season two also adds probational officer ("probie") Tim McGee (played by Sean Murray) as a new agent to the team. (McGee guest starred in a number of episodes in season one as well.)

NCIS is a combination of comedy and drama, and if you like either of the above, you will most likely love NCIS. It's a shame that this show has only just begun to become popular; it deserves far more attention and praise than it has received so far.

I recently used the FURminator for the first time after a beagle breeder noted that our long haired lemon beagle had a thick undercoat that was always tangling. It was very easy to use, and in just a few minutes large amounts of hair was on the floor, and Peaches our beagle looked and felt better with all of the dead undercoat now removed.

Note:  the previous reviewer is mistaken--the Sansa WILL play Audible files.  Just go to the Sandisk website and download the new Firmware update, and everything should work fine.

This is a wonderful little player, even setting aside its low price (I got it for $130 from another site).  The sound quality is very good, and the custom equalizer (which works quite well) allows you to set the music pretty much however you want.  Moving files to the player is simple (I've used MP3 and WMA files so far, and they've all played perfectly)--you don't need to install any new software, just simply drag and drop or cut and paste.  The controls on the player are great:  simple, intuitive, and fast.  You can find any particular song quickly, and you can shuffle all songs or even just the songs by a particular artist.  It won't recognize folders, but I'm guessing this won't matter to most people since the player automatically compiles the ID3 tags for your songs and arranges the music by artist, album, and song.  Additionally, since it's a flash player, the Sansa also doubles as a normal flash drive for data file transfer.  I researched different MP3 players for literally dozens of hours (and actually bought a different one, then returned it), and in my view this is the best value out there.  I highly recommend it.

My wife and I got sucked into season 1 after randomly renting it and we were instantly sold. As you probably know if you're reading this review, season one of heroes is five stars! season 2 doesn't disappoint but the writers strike caused it to be too short - only 13 eps. Not 24 like the first season. Regardless it was still pretty cool and entertaining. The overall stakes don't feel as dire and all the characters don't feel as connected story-wise. Still worth four stars to me though. Buy it - you'll like it.  LOST  is better any day though...

I have very thick, wavy/curly hair and this flat iron has, literally, cut my hair styling time in half!  It's so much thinner/smaller than any other flat iron I've had, so it's easy to travel with and store in small places.  It also doesn't leave my hair looking overstyled or with those too-straight ends.  I also travel frequently to the Northeast and my hair stays straight and friz-free in the humidity.

Battlestar Galactica - a strange name for an addicting series. The acting is superb, the storyline and characters are complex, and the production is cinematic - caveat emptor: if you're new to this series (as I was) - be prepared to purchase the entire series on DVD (I did). Subsequent seasons (2.0 and 2.5) are just as satisfying.

        This review is from: Slumdog Millionaire [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)

      



It's fresh and it's magical and horrific.  It's the hero's story of a quest.  And it's the story of the city of Mumbai, India, with its vast contrasts of utter poverty in an emerging modern world.  It moves with lightning speed and I found myself smiling one minute and grimacing in disgust in another.  It's an emotional roller coaster ride that left me exhilarated and convinced that this breakthrough film is a true global masterpiece.

The film opens as a young Indian man competes on a television quiz show.  He is winning and winning. In the next scene he is being tortured by the police because they think he is cheating as he is not educated and is a child of the slums.  His story is then told in flashbacks, as the audience learns how he came to know the answers to each of the questions.  

We meet him and his brother as young children living on the street and exploited by gangsters to become street beggars.  However, there is constant humor in juxtaposition to the wince-inducing revulsion which adds a special kind of humanity to the story.  Through all the misfortunes to which the brothers are exposed, there is an upbeat quality to the film, as we come to understand that it was these traumatic incidents in this young man's life that taught him the specific answers to the question being asked on the quiz show.

Of course there is also a romance.  Our hero is looking for the young woman he loves, a childhood companion through the horror, who is still being exploited by the Indian underworld, which now includes his brother.  

All of this is packed in an upbeat and moving story that involved me from the beginning and made me want to stand up and cheer at the happy ending.

This is not a film to be missed.  It breaks all the stereotypes and comes across as a groundbreaking fresh new voice in the landscape of the world of film.  I give it my highest recommendation.

I love my labs!  Two chocolate, 125 lbs each, LOTS of hair.  I found the FURminator at a local pet store, and the videos looked great, but I was skeptical, having tried just about everything else.  Once I found it here on Amazon, at a great price, I thought I would try it.  Guess what - it works!  Just like the videos, we ended up with hair all over our family room!  There was no damage to the hair and didn't hurt the dogs in any way.  There wasn't any pulling as I had thought.  After we brushed, their coats glowed!  They had restored luster and shine (sounds like a commercial huh?)  The best part...  the everyday shedding was totally minimized, to the point of no longer having to sweep EVERYDAY anymore!  Give it a try!

This product does exactly what it claims to. It takes care of body hair where you don't want it, and it does so without irritation, rashes or ingrown hairs. I generally use this only on the back of the neck (cleanups between haircuts) and chest, and it's much better than a regualr razor: faster, more effective, safer. Definitely recommended!

It gets four out of five because it's a little noisy and the battery (while long lasting) can only be charged when fully drained. However - I have dropped this numerous times in the shower, some of which cause the entire foil and cutting surfaces to become detached from the body of the groomer. I simply re-inserted them back, and it still worked perfectly. Very surprised at the resiliance of this product, and happy, too.

I have a white australian shepherd/sheltie mutt.  She used to shed all over our clothes, the furniture, and carpet.  This brush does exactly what it says, it removes loose undercoat better than any other brush we tried.  We still vacuum a lot of hair out of the carpet, but I don't have to use a sticky lint roller on my clothes before I leave the house anymore.  I gave it 4 stars because I love it, but my dog hates it.  If it comes across a tangle in the fur the brush will rip the tangle out.  Its a good idea to use another brush first to work out the tangles, but the FURminator is amazing.  You really will have a pile of fur after you have brushed your dog.  It is also a plus that we only have to use it once every 2 or 3 weeks to control the shedding.

This is the deal... This is my fourth one, since I keep selling the previous one with less capacity and getting one bigger... 
Also, the feel on this one is very sturdy as well... 
I would say that is a lot better then my previous one, which was the regular black plastic case. 
The U3 program, it is a handy (and I shall say MUST) factor. 

If you want the program to auto start whenever you plug it in at your USB port (which takes around 5sec.) you just point it out at the installation of the U3 Launchpad, and I bet most of the users having this problem did not try to run and update or at least go to the settings and check this function. 

I have most of the programs I use with this USB drive and whenever I travel and need to use any computer, I just plug it in, and have, all my documents and files (as a regular use of a USB drive) and also the advantage of having my own browser with all my favorites and plug-ins (and cookies and passwords functions as it is set at the USB drive, and not at the computer you are using...), and lots of other programs.. 

There lots of software to anyones interest, Free and paid for... And all of the ones I use are free !! (open office, firefox, skype,etc) 

And if you ever decide to have just an ordinary USB Drive with all the space availabe just to store files.. Just Uninstall it.. [ just look up on google "u3 uninstall" and you will get there..] 

But nowadays, who would not want the REAL Upgrade you can get with a USB Drive.. This the perfection... 

To me, it is a regular Usb Drive most of the time, just transfering documents... But sometimes, I go ahead and start the U3 Launchpad and start using the programs I need, without worring about leaving trails and information at the computer behind... 

And more.. You have all sort of data protection with it, in case it is stolen, lost or someone want to get the date out of it for any purpose.... 

Think again and you will see that this is the Future of USB drive... Just learn how to use and you will not want to have just a regular one anymore... 
U3 is a must ... Once you get used to it... 
Take your time, instead of just listening to people who over react to something that is new... 

As I mentioned at the beggining.. You decide what you want.. 
Regular USB or a Real portable system with all the information at any computer... 

Perfect choice... :-)

I upgraded to this from an old Linksys "b"-speed wireless router. New iPod touch was getting iffy/useless signal, 2 MacBooks experiencing sporadic loss of signal (necessitating router reboots), etc. Gah. I also have 3 PCs (Win2k) and a new MacPro. Leopard on all Macs.

So I got it, used the CDROM that came with, followed instructions (instead of winging it, as I usually do), and I am VERY happy with the results. Pegged signals on all wifi gear, good coverage, full-time, no problems. Price point is ridiculous, quality superb. It even looks kinda cool.

The only catch was with our Tivo... It can't recognize wifi with the new/improved security (WPA2). A tolerable gotcha, no fault of the Linksys. Still deciding whether to buy the new USB/wifi stick for the Tivo or just chuck it for Dish Network hookup. Hm.

We bought this to replace a 6 year old Norelco trimmer with a dead battery. It works quite nicely, just as the previous trimmer worked nicely. With that said, the introduction of the vacuum and "turbo" mode seem really unnecessary. Our experience has been that little bits of hair still fly all over the place, even with the vacuum--although perhaps to a slightly lesser degree. I haven't found the "turbo" mode to be that helpful. From my perspective, it seems to be a marketing tool designed to convince guys that they're getting a really powerful, studly shaver. Power in a car, I can understand. But in a trimmer? Anyway, this is a great little trimmer. I just question the degree to which the new features are improvements.

I ordered what was advertised as an open-box product from Amazon Warehouse (around $20 less than the regular discounted price).  It arrived promptly and in perfect condition, with no sign that it wasn't brand new.

The included CD has Network Magic, which makes the setup very easy.  The router quickly found all my wired and wireless connections, although it did not find an Internet connection. I called D-Link technical service and the rep walked me though the manual setup menu, which is accessed by typing the router's IP address in the browser window.  It was easy enough that I probably should have figured it out myself, but the call took only around 10-15 minutes, including a hold time of only a minute or two.  

Performance has been terrific.  I get a strong signal all though the house and on my back patio, through three walls, even though the router is located under my desk, on top of the CPU.  (The manual suggests  placing it away from the computer, above furniture).  I also have cordless 2.4 GHz telephones in the house, and there have been no problems with interference.

The movie was full of action. The joker was great, performed by Heath Ledger (may his soul rest in peace), however here are my remarks about the movie: 

- Continuous action for 2:20 hours made the movie boring instead of exciting 

- Dark theme, extremely dark. The movie becomes depressing after a while 

- The joker being extremely evil, deserved a worse ending instead of simply being handed to the cops 

- The soundtrack was poor 

- Batman in the end is shown to the public as the villain and gets chased by police dogs!!!!! What a horrible and poor way to end a batman movie 


However, I got to say the best thing about this movie was the joker. The dark knight wasn't about batman but about the joker. He was so bad, evil, sick, and dead smart. His tactics and plans were amazing, I got to salute him.

I purchased the slingbox solo after reading much about it.  I have HD and this allows me to access and stream HD channels without having to buy any extra pieces.  Set up was quick, as Slingbox walks you through everything step by step.  The only problem I ran into was setting up remote viewing.  I clicked on chat, and typed back and forth with a customer service rep.  She could not solve the problem and asked if I would let her take control of my computer.  I hated doing that but let her.  She was not able to resolve the problem, but by watching her click around, I figured out what was wrong.  I thanked her and hung up.  I took control of my desktop and had the remote viewing part up and running quickly.  I wrote this review to explain what happened with my setup and help others too.  

I have a wired/wireless router that assigns ip addresses.  I had changed my router to have a very uncommon ip address.  The slingbox picked that up, but assigned itself an address that ended in 273 if I remember correctly.  My router assigned the slingbox an ip address which ended differently.  Once I chose manual set up during the slingbox walkthrough and typed over the ip address the slingbox had during set up everything was up and running.  I guess I just had a fussy router.  

Slingbox is amazing.  We went home for Christmas and accessed our Slingbox easily from a coffeehouse and from my parents house.  My husband installed mobile software on his dash and was watching a game while we hit the sales December 26. Needless to say we were both happy to be grabbing great bargains while able to check the score and see to a favorite team at the same time.  I highly recommend this product. 

In the fall, our oldest heads to college.  Now we can tape his favorite shows on the DVR and he can still watch them from his lap top.  Great product.

I read the book before I saw the movie in theaters, and I have to say for a page to screen transition they did pretty well. I wish they didn't cut out so much but hey it's a movie, what do you really expect? But let's get on with this shall we.

First my honest opinions, one, for a low budget film this was well done, and that's not particularily easy to do. Aliens for instance was a relatively low budget movie and it's now a classic. But this brings me to my next point, if you don't care about the movie enough to really enjoy it, then don't bother. This was basically made by a fan of the book as far as I can tell, so it was made with them in mind. If you don't care enough about it to really watch the movie then most likely yeah you'll think it sucks. But if you take your time to watch it you may very well enjoy it. And by reading the book you'll become even more entranced by the story, the relationship between Edward and Bella is really interesting and just sparks curiosity. The movie's not too bloody either, which is nice for a change, too many gore porn films out there. As a film itself it's cute, but not Grammy award winning, but who cares. 

Basically if you really watch it and don't criticize it every minute, you'll probably love it. I sure did, even though the book as always is better.

This machine has performed with excellence for over two months.The water is always a perfect temp. and after a few trials to adjust the right grind, the creme is so thick that it lasts until the final drop of coffee.  I always thought only a machine costing 300-600 dollars would satisfy me but the Lello 45900 Artete gives me better than commercial "coffe house" results.  One thing more, the construction is solid.  This is not your cheap plastic make believe espresso machine.  A joy to wake up to!!

This KitchenAid mixer is an excellent investment! I just love mine! The dough hook attachment is the greatest invention ever. No more kneading! I used this wonderful machine to make 4 pounds of Pizza Geina dough without breaking a sweat. Add your ingredients, turn it on and it does the rest! It has a very powerful motor and every part of this mixer is excellent quality and well made. It is simple to lock in the mixing bowl and it is also a breeze to clean. The different attachments are very easy to attach and remove. It would be impossible not to love it! Did I mention how easy the clean up is?  I love it so much I bought the KitchenAid quilted cover for it.  Once you use this mixer you will never want to use anything else! The Best!!!

This is the same type if mixer that my mom had on her counter for years and is still making food prep less cumbersome for me! I have been using this mixer for everything since it arrived! It is nice to be able to walk away while mixing.  Clean-up is easy (most of the attachments I put into the dishwasher but they are truly easy to clean by hand). This creams butter quickly while i am working on other things in the kitchen. It is like having an assitant!  I love being able to start mixing after i put in my first ingedient so that the dough can mix as I add in the rest ofthe ingredients.  Tis mizer cuts my mixing time in half, easy!  I have really enjoyed the recipes in the instruction manual.  There are also tons of recipes online for doughs, etc using a stand mixer.

This is a great cardio video.  She goes through teaching each dance segment.  I recommend really learning each dance because when you do the entire hour of cardio she goes extremely fast.  I have danced all my life.  I am not a professional, but I am some what coordinated and this is very hard.  I think it will just take lots of practice, but it is well worth it.  I would recommend the mat workout too.  It is difficult, but doable.  Tracy suggests you do each video every day.  That is 2 hours a day.  I rotate the 2 videos daily so that I work out 60 minutes a day.  That is what works for me.

After reading others rave about the Furminator I decided to order it for my constantly shedding yellow Labrador Retriever.  Well, it really gets a lot of fur off my dog, but I think I could brush her all day long and still get tons of hair off her!  She just never stops.  If you are hoping that this will slow down your dog's shedding (and the fur floating all over the house)you must be willing to groom your dog daily.  That is the only way we have had less hair in the house, on the furniture and us; if you get lazy and miss a couple of days, it's like you have never"furminated" before. My dog is healthy and eats an excellent diet, the shedding is characteristic of the breed, but the furminator has given her coat more of a lustor and kept her looking sleeker.

This is a very good product if you are counting steps.  The only drawback to it is that it does not track aerobic activity other than the treadmill.  My aerobic activity is taebo and it can't track that activity.  Other than that, I love it.  I have started to park further from the building to get in some extra steps.

</review>

<review id="432">

I haven't used another pedometer so I can't say if this model ranks better than others or not.  According to many other reviewers here, this one is more accurate than most and I'll take their word for it.

I've used this model for several weeks now and given three others to loved ones.  I do find that it does indeed make me walk more - research has shown that most people put more effort into walking after they start using a pedometer.  And as far as I can tell, this model is indeed accurate for the most part.

I noticed something, however, that users should be aware of.  I went through many of the older reviews for this product and found a few from users who said that the pedometer doesn't record all steps taken.  Despite all the rave reviews, this is indeed true. 

I've found that short bursts of walking are frequently not recorded.  However, there seems to be a difference on where you're walking that causes this to happen.  In my home where I have hard wood floors and very small carpets most steps are recorded.  In my office with wall-to-wall carpeting I found that probably only about 10% to 25% of all the steps I take were recorded.  I don't spend a lot of time walking in my office so this isn't a big deal for me.  I don't know if carpet is the issue or not, but users need to be aware that this might be an issue, especially if they're in such an environment all day long.

Some have commented on how accurate this model is in terms of distance and have tested it on a measured track.  Since users enter their individual stride length - and assuming this is accurate - distance accuracy isn't really that big of a selling point.  The primary issue is the ability to record actual steps.  

The fact that you don't have to have the pedometer on your belt (you can carry it in a bag or pocket) is a major selling point.  

In most situations the Omron records my steps.  I figure it's missing a few hundred, but that's not a big deal when you consider that one should be making thousands of steps per day.  So for me the Omron works. Your mileage may vary.

I just recently discovered this show and been watching it from the beginning, starting with the 3 hour mini-series and the first season.
I was made aware of this show by continuesly reading about it in TV Guide...i kept thinking "how annoying is this show"? Oh heck, i broke down and ordered it on Netflix just to check it out so i can say i gave it a try. Then....i fell hard for the show and it's characters.
I can't gush enough about it...i am undoubtedly annoying all my friends and family. Now my sister is starting to watch it, too.
All i can say is BRAVO....for the action, the effects,the storylines, but most importantly, the superb acting.
The commander is my favorite. He just steals every scene he's in, even if he doesn't speak a word! What would the show be without him? He centers everybody. Starbuck is one tough chick but underneath it all she has a tender heart and Apollo is just hot. They would make a great couple. Hehehe. Another thing i really like about the show is that the female characters are so strong. They aren't just there to dress up the scenery.
The girl that plays Cylon Sharon is a great character and i really feel for her even though she's suposed to be a machine. I don't want to close this review without mentioning the doctor character. How original is this guy? Incredible. And i really like the whole thing with him and the invisible sexy Cylon. Never a dull moment.

I originally bought the Linksys WCG200 Wireless Cable Modem Gateway, and had too many problems with it.  I decided to replace the Linksys WCG200, I bought the Mototorla SBG900, plugged it in, called my cable company with the new MAC address, and in minutes I was up and running with no problems! It was easy to set up, and the web interface is easy to use and has all the features I need.  I can even change the user-name in the log-in screen for the router configuration (I couldn't do that on the Linksys WCG200).  I would highly recommend the Motorola SBG900 over the Linksys WCG200.

When reviewing or buying this product, you have to remember that you are only paying about $50-80 more than some of the most basic digital cameras there are.  The price tag on this little camera is not going to hurt anyone!! The video quality is more than adequate for casual usage.  The camera quality, like a lot of reviews have said, is a little on the weak side indoors, but that can be compensated for using the ISO function.  It's easy to use, pocket size, very adequate for anything that someone looking to spend $250 for a video camera is wanting to do!!!  Great buy for the price!! (Obviously there are better cameras on the market, but you're going to pay for them.  A lot of reviews have compared this camera to many camera's that are double and triple the price.... that says a lot in itself!!)

We use the medium Furminator on our three dogs and three cats. It works as advertised and does such a remarkable job removing the excess fur that it almost appears as if the animal is being shaved. The tool itself has a sturdy heft and appears to be very well made. I expect it to last a long time, so it was worth the extra cost. I was skeptical at first about a grooming brush costing $25, but it's absolutely been worth it. The hair literally does fly right off and our animals appear to shed less afterwards. The only reason I've given this four instead of five stars is that the teeth can be a little sharp. That's clearly part of what makes this brush work so well, but it did contribute to my dog getting a red spot on his should after his first brushing. The brush works so well that it can easily be wielded too heavy handedly, so be aware of that when purchasing this product. It was mostly my fault, I was over excited at how well it was working and I really went to town, but the blades could likely be a little less razor sharp. That being said, I HIGHLY recommend this brush.

My daughter (18 months now!) loves this series.  She laughs and claps whenever I put it on.
We started showing her the series at about 7 months but she didn't get interested until about 13 months.  I was shocked at how quickly she began making signs at that point.
Her verbal skills are expanding rapidly at this point but her pronunciation is still horrible - like most toddlers, only mommy and daddy can understand what she says.  Signing lets her get her point across much more easily so she feels far less frustrated.
The only odd thing I've noticed is with the Mommy and Daddy signs.  These are hard concepts to get across in a video and my daughter has ended up thinking all women are called mommy and all men are daddy.  My husband and I are still DADDY and MOMMY however - note the captial letters - so I don't see it as a problem.  In time she will learn that the correct word for other women is WOMAN and the correct word for other men is MAN.

I have it set up in my home network. bought it 2 days ago and its fully functional.  all laptops are more delicate than desktops and not a replacement.  i got a service plan through BB in the case of hardware damage such as the monitor.  this is always wise.  anyway, take care of it and you have a great machine with great graphics capability and i already have an HP desktop and i'd say its comparable if not better.

This waterpik is functioning very well. I used a Waterpick 30 years ago when I had braces. At a recent trip to the dentist the waterpik was recommended to me again--probably because I hate flossing. The waterpik is probably more effective than flossing in cleaning teeth and gums. It also leaves my gums feeling as if they have been massaged. I expect that my dental hygenist will have less work to do at the next appointment. The coiled tube from the pump to the jet nozzle is adequate length. If I could change one thing I would make the water reservoir a little larger, but it is still adequate. 

The turnaround and shipping time by Amazon on this purchase was excellent as well.

There is not a lot i can say about these systems that has not been said already.

I chose the 1000HA over countless other models and manufacturer's because of the hard drive speed exceeding inexpensive solid-state drive speed; the multi-touch trackpad; the relatively bountiful standard ports available as opposed to proprietary; and for the 6-cell battery.

I am impressed with the performance all around after not having used a netbook regularly.

If you are wondering whether you want a pedometer, let me add my vigorous "yes".  Wearing a pedometer has a way of making you parse every step you take as exercise....even walking down the hall to ask an officemate a question raises your step count just a bit, and soon enough you will be raising your ambitions to 10,000 steps a day or even more without needing to make a production over going to the gym.

If you are wondering "which pedometer," I'll add my pitch for this nifty little Omron.  My last pedometer:  inaccurate, physically uncomfortable, impossible to wear with a dress, broke after 2 months.  

My Omron:  accurate, comfortable clip, even works if I just stick it in a pocket or purse, have dropped it frequently to no ill effects.  Best of all, it has quite sophisticated features: it tracks not only steps, miles, and calories, but "aerobic steps" - if you keep walking for 10 minutes or more it counts as aerobic - it is even smart enough to let you pause for up to a minute and still count subsequent steps as aerobic.  Finally, it has a 7-day memory that allows you to track all these features back a whole week so you can see your improvements.

I can't say enough about this product.  I know they call it "premium" but for less than the cost of a couple of weeks at a gym, you'll have a permanent and genuinely practical exercise system. It is the best fitness value of any kind on the market.

First of all, I am 33 years old, and I fell in love with Twilight just last week. I have read all four books now, and Breaking Dawn is my favorite. I don't know why people want to post with such hate for the books, I don't understand. I am in love with them! I have not been this excited over books since Harry Potter came out! I am sick of the comparisons to Harry Potter, there is no comparison! Get over that Bella loves Edward, and would do anything for him! I don't find Bella whiny, I find her quite strong in what she believes and what she wants, and that is Edward.

Breaking Dawn had some turns that quite surprised me. **SPOILERS**
Such as Bella having a baby and almost dying from it. I did not see that one coming! I was a little disappointed with the ending. I expected this huge war where I though that maybe Renesseme (not sure if I spelled it right) would be the one to have some special power to save them, I was glad to find that Bella had her special power, but I did expect the war to last longer than it did. They did not even fight! 
When the war first started, I was so worried, I saw there was only a few pages left, and I thought there is no way they can fight, then end with finding out what happened to all of them after the war, but it ended nicely enough, but like I said I was a little disappointed with the ending, but still love the book.

This was very easy to use and easy to set up. I should have gotten the one with more space. I just saw there is a 250GB ClickFree. I only wished I had read that it only works for Windows XP and higher. I had planned to put my old computer data on this device, but found out it doesn't work for Windows 98. It may have said that, but I didn't seem to read that info before buying. Also I wish you could upload videos directly to Youtube or wherever directly from the device. Maybe this is possible, but so far, I haven't been able to do this.
But it is great for the average person, they can just hook it up and you're done.

I was looking for a blanket sleeper for my son who is very very long. He outgrew the carters version at 4 months.  My son is in the 90th percentile for length, and I followed the Halo sizing charts for length and weight, and the sleepsack still has more than plenty of room left below his feet. I do wish though that it had sleeves, but that contradicts the whole purpose of it not causing re-breathing and helping to prevent SIDS. So i just put on a long sleeve onsie undershirt under his pj's and then put the Halo on. LOVE IT!

I've used TurboTax for over ten years. I like the fact that the product format is consistent. The platform and interview style has remained user friendly. The ability to import my information from previous years makes everything move along faster. The only suggest I could make would be to simplify the ability to jump back and forth between the interview and the actual tax forms. Overall a great product.

This was a good purchase and the recipe book is great! I've made half of them now; some were awesome, some good, some didn't work. The only negative was that it was pretty loud and it got hot around the base after 10 minutes or so, which I found strange. An ice cream maker shouldn't get hot! The ice cream is still really yummy, but the machine could use a few mechanical tweeks. Overall, for $60, it does the job and there haven't been any major problems!

Great little hard drive (I store all my music (Itunes program and music)and Photo programs on it).  These are all easily accessiable just by pugging in the drive. (It treats it like a C drive)so there is no problem getting pictures from one drive and then altering them with a program on another.  Plus my music and video files were getting so large it took up almost half my hard drive.  Having if off the hard drive has made my computer run a lot faster, It has a ton a space for something so small.  I do recommend getting the case for it unless it will be out 24/7.  It is so small it could get lost,stepped on, etc. Better safe than sorry.   It transports great in the little case also.  I would diffently recomend this for someone who needs more computer space. It is awesome!  Much better than some of the other brands I tried in the past. A++++++

I am not a hairy guy by normal standards, and I was able to shave 98% of what I wanted to shave (when I first bought it I decided to shave everything just to see if I could do it without any problems). It also touches up like a charm, never nicks although if you apply too much pressure (excessive) you might get feel it rub for a split second. Under normal usage conditions though absolutely no problems. It is not very useful when the shower is on, and it has a hard time completely taking off the fine hair on my thighs. Which is strange since it removes absolutely everything else. 

For the $40 I spent though, it worked out the gate 5x more efficiently than any $100 razor I used on my face for the first time. For general use I give it an A- but for people looking for that porcelain smooth shave in all areas I give it a B+. Works extremely well, not perfect.

This book is an IMPERATIVE read!  If you really want to preserve this country and the heritage that was given to us, this book is a MUST READ!!  I cannot stress how educational, inspiring, and easy to read this book is.  I don't read much at all and it takes a lot for me to pick up a book I know nothing about and read it.  This book was recommended to by by a man called GLenn Beck on a radio program.  I knew nothing about it but decided to read it.  Boy! what an education!!  I never leraned so much about HOW our constitution was formed and why it was formed as it was.

This book must be put in all the public libraries, schools and universities in this country.

It is a very understandable book.  A child could read it and understand what the founders of America were trying to do but most of all WHY they wrote what they wrote.  It is no longer enough for Americans to have an overview of the founding documents that make up our govenmental system.  We MUST have an intimate and accurate understanding of what our founders where trying to do and what their intentions were.  

That is what this book is all about.  It will inspire pride, honor and more love for this country in your heart than you ever thought possible.  I am giving this book to each member of my family..especially my sons who are both in the military.  Please buy this book, read it and you will say from your heart "God has blessed America Indeed".

This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)

      



Before WALL-E starts, there is a cartoon short. This cartoon features a baby bunny who works for a magician. The bunny wants a carrot, and most of the cartoon is spent on bunny's efforts to get the carrot. The magician is able to put his hand into a bag, and have it come out of his hat, even when his hat is 20 feet away from him. At one point, the bunny is off to the side of the stage and holding the hat. The magician stuffs his hand in the bag, and it comes out of the hat, but when it comes out it touches an electric socket. The electric shock causes the magician to dance. A couple of members of the orchestra take out a banjo and washboard and play some rapid-fire bluegrass music, to accompany the magician's clogging dance! Yee-hawwww! At another point in the cartoon, a rope hoists a piano up above the stage. As one might expect, it later crashes down with a bang. The bunny-rabbit cartoon is colorful and features many crazy angles. The bunny cartoon is a masterpiece. The bunny cartoon is filled with action, attractive colors, and clever antics. FIVE STARS for the bunny cartoon. 

Now this is about WALL-E. The movie called "WALL-E" is a severe disappointment.

The film begins with a robotic trash compactor working in a trash dump near a big city, perhaps Chicago or New York City. The robot lives in a little metal house, situated on the site of the garbage dump. The little house has many interesting things inside, such as amusing knick-knacks that the robot finds and collects, during his daytime job of compacting trash. The robot also likes to watch a Broadway musical (Hello Dolly) that features corny singing and dancing. I liked this part of the movie. I liked the clever knick-knacks in the robot's house, for example, the Rubik's cube. 

Then, the love interest arrives. It is a probe robot, sent by a colony of humans to seek for plant life on earth, in order to determine if it is safe for the space-bound earthlings to return to earth. The probe robot successfully finds a little plant, provided by Wall-e. The little plant is kept in a child's leather boot. The probe robot has violent instincts, and causes widespread destruction around the trash dump, by way of a ray gun. For example, the probe robot destroys a row of large oceangoing ships, destined for compacting. In fact, Wall-e cringes in fear at the probe robot's indiscriminate use of the ray gun. It is not at all clear why Wall-e falls takes a liking to the violent space probe. At any rate, Wall-e does. 

When it comes time for the lovely female space probe to return to the mother ship, Wall-e clings to outside of the shuttle ship, and joins the humans on space colony. At this point, we are introduced to the humans who, for 700 years, have done nothing but gain weight, watch television, and eat junk food. There are some typical fights and chase scenes involving Wall-e and the robots in the space station. Another source of conflict is that the automated computer running the space station attempts to take over. (This part of the plot does not fit into the basis premise of the movie. This part of the plot was arbitrarily copied from the Stanley Kubrick classic, 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY). 

Other reviewers have pointed out that WALL-E contains no dialogue, aside from chirps/squeak sounds of Wall-e and the female space probe. What bothered me was the lack of interesting scenery in WALL-E. Much of the movie is spent in an ugly garbage dump. The garbage dump is a monotonous light brown or orange color. WALL-E dwells extensively on the obesity, consumerism, laziness, excessive eating of junk food, and excess television watching of the people in the space colony. Although there is a grain of truth to this (especially as to obesity), I would not characterize human beings, or American people, as lazy and prone to eating too much junk food or to excessive television watching. Because of the movie's constant dwellings on obesity, laziness, consumerism, and excessive TV watching, I found most of WALL-E to be an insult. The writers of WALL-E failed to understand the virtues of subtlety. WALL-E is simply not cut from the same cloth as other Pixar films, such as Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, or Toy Story 1 and 2.

Every review I have read regarding the Gillette Fusion razor and blades has been from a male.  I am a female and love this razor for my legs and underarms!  I received mine in the mail as a promotion about a year ago, and am still on the original blade!  I often use my Remington electric shaver, but when I want a really smooth, close shave that lasts almost a week, I use my Gillette Fusion.  So, while I've had it a year, I've probably used it a couple dozen times and the blade is just now starting to dull.  I agree with others that the trimmer on the reverse side is a gimmick, especially for a female who doesn't shave sideburns or nose hair.  My only complaint, like many other users of the Gillette Fusion, is the cost of replacement cartridges.  Thankfully, one or two cartridges will last me a very long time!

The new version of BG, airing on Sci-Fi, is an amazing show. It's plot is deep and addictive, and if you're even remotely interested in Sci-Fi, pick this one up. However, if you're a fan of the original, be wary of a few major changes. The Cylons now have a human look and feel to them, and Starbuck is now a woman. All in all, this is a good watch.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1.	Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr) is a playboy genius whose passion is making things that go boom, day or night
2.	Behind the successful billionaire is a pretty woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) showing off her organizational skills
3.	During a product demonstration in Afghanistan, Stark is kidnapped by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings, sustaining serious injuries
4.	Ten Rings wants to rule them all, and they want Stark to forge them the one weapon that can do it*
5.	Working in the darkness where the shadows lie* Stark and Dr. Yinsen (a fellow prisoner who patched him up) pull a switcheroo and build a full metal power suit with a flame thrower and missile launcher.
6.	The Ten Rings are left to pick up the pieces
7.	Stark has a new corporate vision which gets a stormy reception from his partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) and the Board of Directors.
8.	He fashions himself a new and improved armored suit, with all the trimmings, bells and whistles, plus the obligatory arc reactor which is the heart of the design
9.	With help from Pepper Potts (Paltrow) and Lt. Col. Rhodes (Terrence Howard), Stark suits up to battle the bad guys
10.	Two sequels are planned

The movie takes a while to get to the really cool stuff, and while I enjoyed the whole thing, my son didn't get into it until "suit time."  There's no denying that the finished suit is the coolest superhero costume ever, and I'm buying this on DVD just to watch the cybernetic Mark III suit morph, flex and create havoc and mass destruction

Downey proves himself to be an excellent choice for the lead role, and although they are unable to steal his thunder, Bridges and Paltrow are pretty darned good themselves.  Howard doesn't have that much screen time, but maybe he'll get his moment in the sequels

Highly recommended.

My 2007 MacBook's hard drive crashed a while back and erased everything important...my music, my resume, my class syllabi...everything of any value.

I'm determined not to let that happen again.  So far the Iomega eGo with Firewire and USB 2.0 is working great.  I am running OS X 10.5.5 with Time Machine, which automatically backs my entire computer to my hard drive whenever I plug it in.  What a nifty feature!

The drive was pre-formatted so I didn't need to do any work.  Plug and play...that's it.  So far this product is a five star item - nice size, holds tons of stuff and feels solid.  I'll be sure to update if any problems arise.

This is the first pedometer I have ever had and so far it has been really nice.  When I first set it up, I measured my stride quite a few times and took an average.  Then I walked a 1 mile loop in my neighborhood several times, checking the pedometer after each mile.  It was within 0.01 mile accuracy.  I'd say that's pretty darn good!  Not as accurate with hiking in the mountains for obvious reasons, stride length varies depending on the terrain.  And I like the safety line so I don't have to worry about the unit slipping off of my waist as I walk.

I'm no coffee snob - just trying to make a decent cup of espresso with a basic Gaggia - but this Capresso does produce a fine and consistent grind.

The grind is adjustable for when coarser grounds are needed (e.g., my French press).  Putting on the plastic bean hopper takes a bit of getting used to - JUST BE GENTLE and line up the dots!  Some folks note that there's no way to shut off the timer - well, if your beans are done, so what if it grinds air for an extra 15 seconds?  Or just unplug the machine and the timer clicks out anyway.

One final tip: Save yourself a headache.  Given how often products of all types are "discontinued" these days, I recommend ordering spare parts NOW, just in case.  An order form is enclosed with this grinder.  I did, and got extra lids, bean hopper, dispensing drawer, and several of the little rubber collars that fit above the burrs, in about a week, for less than $20.  If you clean this machine regularly, it looks like it would last a while.  (I've already lost the little brush that was included, and am resorting to a toothbrush.)

This review is from: Pinocchio (Disney Gold Classic Collection) (DVD)

      



A milestone in animated films, but it's also a timeless movie that appeals to kids as well as adults. It's remarkable how all Disney films have been such a big part of so many kids' childhood, and 'Pinocchio' is usually  among the ones that leave a profound impact, name another film that could  make you more afraid of lying. The animation is still astonishing, the  degree of detail is breathtaking, even more impressive by the fact that it  was all done by hand and this was one of the earliest animated films. The  story has a timelessness to it and an effortless charm that's hard to beat,  the movie basically puts you under Disney's spell for 80 rewarding minutes.  Out of all the Disney films, 'Pinocchio' and 'Snow White' are the only ones  that can be considered classics, not just because they have aged so well or  because they have played such a big role in all our childhood, but because  there's a certain air of experimentalism to them, animated films were just  a new thing and they could take you places you couldn't even imagine. This  particularly was a labor or love by everyone involved, you can sense that  it was made with dedication and care. Filled with many memorable and  enchanting moments, who can forget 'When You Wish Upon A Star'? or even the  characters; Gepetto, Cleo, Figaro, Monstro the Whale and especially Jiminy  Cricket have been deeply rooted into the American culture. An enchanting  film that never gets old. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 10!

If you're going buy this DVD set, you might as well buy Season 2, 2.5, 3, and 4 b/c you'll probably rip through the first season in a few days.  I was back online within the first hour of watching Season One to make sure I had copies of the other seasons on their way.  

Yes, Season One and the entire mini-series is really that good.   Great characters, just enough CGI to help sell the outerspace and action scenes, intense drama and suspense.   I can't think of one negative thing to say about Season One, only that I waited too long to start watching.

Buy this DVD and as well as the other seasons.

I thought that this machine will add up with my chores, but in fact it takes just 5 min /or less/ to put the ingredients in it then just press start and in 4 to 6 hours there is freshly baked bread on the table and the whole house smells wonderful!

I'm not a super techie, so I was a bit worried about setting this thing up.  However, I had this little baby up and running in less than an hour.  The secret is to not use the disc that comes with it, but go directly to the linksys website.  The have a setup program there (for XP only) called NetSet that is super easy.  Using the disc, I kept getting a message that said that the router could not connect to the internet.  No such issues with the NetSet, it found the internet and was hooked up and working in about 15 minutes.  Setting the security was a little more confusing, but this router seems to have all of the bells and whistles around security, so I was able to figure it out by googling some instructions.  Overall, I'm very happy.

Unlike some of the generic glucosamine chondroitin products, Cosequin works great for our 20-year old cat. Her mobility was greatly enhanced after just three doses of Cosequin. She is able to jump again and her joints seem more flexible. When she wakes from a cat nap, she no longer walks stiff-legged. 

This formula is specifically for felines, so you can feel safe giving it to your cat.  Most other products tout that they are for both dogs and cats.  It's rare that a product is actually good for both.

I bought the Omron HR-100C heart rate monitor after putting up with the Polar brand monitors for many years. The Polar monitors worked well, but the display unit and the chest belt each had built-in batteries that, when they died, could be replaced only by Polar. You had to send it to Polar for replacement - a nuisance, and costly. This Omron system is different in that the batteries in both the display unit and the chest belt are easily replaceable by the user. Aside from that, the Omron system works as well as the Polar, and appears to be well built. However, I do have one minor caveat: If your heart rate exceeds the maximum that you set the system for,  the resultant alarm is only visual, not audible as with Polar.

Like other movies, The Wizard of Oz has been subjected to a number of re-issues, each one trying to top the previous one.  I can't imagine anything topping this one though.  First (as DVD 2 tells us), for this one the producers have taken the negatives and made a wholly new clean-up, realligning frames that had only vaguely matched before.  The result is digital clarity and incredibly indellible colors.  The performance is still as great as it always was, but we just see it so much better.  The added material of home movies, movie-tone news clips, and deleted scenes has been available before.  The 3rd DVD has several VERY early Oz movies that were produced by L. Frank Baum himself.  One of them even features a young Oliver Hardy.  They are a strange assortment of movies, but each one has points of interest and they amount to over 3 hours of viewing.  With this release we are taken "over the rainbow" to a kind of release which, like Ben Hur's new 4 DVD special, is very appreciated and goes as far as a company needs to go in presenting interesting features.

The shifter does not center correctly in sequential mode.  Been through two of them.  Many, many others reporting the same issues.  Throw forward to engage is much longer than throw rearward, and sometimes it never disengages rearward engagement, causing you to miss shifts and run off the track.

The software is NOT fully Vista compatible.  The profiler is pretty well busted at this point.

I'm not sure how they can use the "Vista Compatible" label, and not have software available.

I love this litter box.  I had a LitterMaid for two years and the motor burned out.  There was no way I would purchase another LitterMaid so I went looking for another litter box that would be easy to use and minimize my having to scoop.  This one is a dream come true.  I gave it 4/5 stars because for a litter box that is called "large" it is not quite large enough.  My two boys are about 20 pounds each and they need enough room to be comfortable.  They seem to like this litter box, but I would like it to be a bit bigger.  Size aside, this is my favorite litter box ever!  [Oh, and it's not green/beige - it's blue/gray]

Powerful story, fine art, an intriguing mix of stories within stories.  Basically we have a set of back stories illuminating the lives of the heroes, mixed with intercut 'documents' and an overarching narrative concerning a putative plot to eliminate the heroes so that some grand, dark event can occur without their interference.  To summarize would be to spoil.  Suffice to say, that all of the narrative lines converge, an event occurs and the aftermath becomes the subject of controversial reflection.  As the main narrative proceeds, a second narrative parallels it (from a comic book read by a young bystander within the principal narrative).  The interplay between these two narratives is central to the final resolution, in my opinion, but I can't describe it without spoiling the principal narrative.  The architectonics of the plots are very impressive and engaging, though the greatest amount of attention is likely to be focused upon the aftermath of the 'event' and the degree to which one 'agrees' with it.  Highly recommended.  This is the graphic novel as true art.

I had originally ordered an apple ipod from somewhere else-with a screen and a greater memory, but it did not work.  This was the replacement ipod, and it seems to work just fine, has sufficient capabilities for my needs, is much cheaper, and is like wearing a microphone-nice and light.

The skin is useful. I could type as much as 40 wpm without it (as a self-taught typist), but was slowing myself down by "cheating." The skin forces me to follow the correct patterns, which are more efficient than my old way, and I no longer go back and forth from the copy to to the keyboard to watch my fingers.

I don't own a Cuisinart coffee maker currently offered by Amazon, but I want to write about the one I have, the DCC-2400.  I assume that other Cuisinart coffee makers are as well designed as mine is.

My wife and I have gone though a variety of inexpensive coffee makers in the last 25 years.  All of them brewed coffee of course, but there was something wrong with all of them.  It was the design.  The Cuisinart DCC-2400 is the best designed coffee maker I have ever seen.  

Our last coffee maker came from Black and Decker.  It's a cute little thing that hangs under a kitchen cabinet.  It features  10 cup thermal carafe with a convenient coffee dispenser in the handle.  It's nice to be able to leave the carafe sealed and pour a single cup.  My only complaint about that coffee maker was that I could not tell when it was "on" or brewing.  The LCD display was too small and at the wrong angle for a standing person to read.  A simple red LED in the panel is all that was needed.  That's what I mean about design.  I assume that folks with better hearing than mine have no problem knowing when the thing is working.  It's design folks.  

The DCC-2400 has it all.  By the way, it brews good coffee too.  I can find nothing wrong with it at all.  It even has a built in water filter.  It costs just a little more than most of the other ones.  I really recommend it!

I plugged this directly into my Dell XPS600 motherboard's SATA sockets with StarTech 6 Ft. Shielded External eSATA to SATA Cable, M/M (SATA2ESATA6) , told the BIOS to turn on the 3rd SATA socket, and I am sucessfully transferring files at 95MB/s to and from my RAID 0 hard drive, which is far, far faster than my old Firewire 400 setup.

This will become my primary backup hard drive and my old firewire hard drive will become my off-site backup hard drive that I will bring home from work once a week to refresh the files.

I did not install the backup software that came with it or any of the cables that came with it (USB, Firewire 400, Firewire 800 AND eSata) because I am happy with SyncBackFree & BeyondCompare for backup and I needed the one cable they did not provide, nor did I expect them to.

It seems to be a quality hard drive and very quiet.

An amazing book in the Twilight series!  I titled my review consuming because it consumed all of my time and my thoughts!  I read it continuously and when I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it!  Very well thought out and written.  All of the books flow directly into one another staying in line with the characters and events.  The author doesn't leave holes or give lengthy explanations.  But, instead, uses single words with impactful meanings and short sentences that say a lot. Eclipse is a must-read!  One of my favorites in the series!

The Philips Norelco 8240XL is a nice mid level shaver. It gives me a good shave and is a nice solid unit. It comes with a nice protective case that will keep it safe in your travel kit. Had I not moved up to a top of the line shaver before getting this unit, I would have been very happy with it. It will be a big upgrade to my travel kit. It is a lot nicer than the shaver I used just 2 years ago as my main one. It doesn't have the digital battery level indicator or stand that I've gotten to like in my other shavers so I miss those. 

My main shaver is the Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men's Shaving System which is awesome. It is also twice the price. I also use the Philips Norelco 8040X Moisturizing Shaving System in the shower, or when I want to shave with shaving gel. It gives an incredibly close shave.

Overall I am extremely impressed with the Philips Norelco line of shavers. If you are in the market for a mid level shaver, then the 8240XL is a solid choice. If you are ready to spend the money to get a top of the line model then the Arcitec 1090 is a great choice. I love mine. I'm also becoming very fond of the wet dry 8040X system.

I've used both of the popular income tax programs, and I find TaxCut to be superior.  It's easy to use and very thorough, even for complex returns.  I have two LLC's and two sole proprietor businesses.  It does 1099's and Schedule K's for the LLC's and everything necessary for home businesses as well.

I was fortunate enough to have a fellow Whedon fan forward me to Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long blog in the short week it was initially available for free. Soon after, I bought digital downloads. Soon after that, I bought the soundtrack. It mirrored my obsession of Buffy The Vampire Slayer's episode "Once More With Feeling"; the songs get stuck in my head for days, and I never mind them being there.

You'd think that I wouldn't need this DVD since I already have access to its content in several different mediums. Think again.

This DVD also contains "Commentary! The Musical!" featuring additional musical content as voice over commentary, with more music than the actual set of webisodes themselves! This is in addition to a standard commentary with the writers and stars, and making-of content.

This is a must have for fans of the Whedon family, fans of Neil Patrick Harris, and fans of good musicals.

A must-have for a newborn baby.  I would not recommend buying the larger size because my older baby does not like being so wrapped up.  Would definitely suggest getting this for a newborn baby.

An honest review, from 2 satisfied, long-term customers . . .

Same as flossing, only different. MUCH better.

My wife and I have used 5 of these over a 10+ year span (some were an earlier model, round & small). After about 2-3 years of use the motor brushes wear down, and after a few fits and starts a replacement is ordered. Amazon has always had them for $30, so, it costs around $1/month. 

If you have braces or any dental work, you should just flat-out get one.

The "20 minutes" spec is how long a pair of AA batt's will run the pump at full strength. So, 40 seconds of use each day will run them low in a month or so. You can keep using them, they're just weaker. We recycle batteries.

I cannot imagine going anywhere without it. I have another at work for use after lunch.

You'll stand agog, watching 'fresh garbage' tumble into the sink. You don't want this gunk in your mouth; you know what it turns into (and smells like). You just never got to see it up close until now. Whether to refill it or not depends on whether it's still pulling chunks of food out of your mouth. Meat, bacon, popcorn, fish, seeds, nuts, candy, spices, veggies, etc., no longer held in limbo.

Don't touch the plastic tip directly to your teeth to completely eliminate any scratches. It is considered a 'personal' device, but we both use the same one. 1-year warranty.

Rechargeable Ni-Mh batteries at 1.2 volts have less 'oomph' -- an Akaline's voltage is 25-30% higher, so the pump works harder. Your choice.

So, if using alkaline batteries makes it too strong for you to take, switch to rechargeables or some weak alkalines (and NEVER mix battery types). Later, when your gums are healthier, you can step up to a stronger stream. The purpose of the EW1270AC is to clean and strengthen your gums, and I find it does a super job.

If you'll take my advice for a terrific toothbrush, I prefer the Cybersonic 2 (or #3) Oralcare System Toothbrush ($30 or $50, 110V charging stand, Amazon). We've had 5 of these things over 10+ years (we have a #2 and a #3 right now). Got our first one as a birthday present. I was amazed the first time I used it - got a funky taste in my mouth that got stronger and stronger after 2 minutes of brushing as it pulled off crud that my old toothbrush had left behind. Been using Cybersonics ever since.
Imagine a powerful tuning fork with an ordinary brush humming on the end. Two fresh snap-on brushes arrive in the mail every 3 months (for $5, which also pays for the warranty coverage). You'll find that ordinary electric toothbrushes cost a lot of $$$ for complicated replacement brushes, so they don't get changed.
After about 5 years, the internal batteries won't hold much charge, it's sealed watertight so you can't replace them. Your warranty buys you a new one; you pay $10 S&H. For fresh brushes and the cleanest mouth I could possibly have, the two together cost 10 cents/day (with high power Ni-Mh). Cheap. I hope they make both of these for a long, long time.

We can not imagine going anywhere without both of them (read, they both travel very well on vacations).  And my hygenist isn't flirting with me -- my mouth really is very clean. She always hands me a complimentary toothbrush and travel toothpaste, and I always hand the toothbrush back.

This tiny camera is perfect for keeping with you at all times, just in case of a celeb sighting, cute kid trick - whatever flips your lid.

The Flip is a $100 product, so don't expect high-quality video or audio - it doesn't like too much movement and forget about taping stuff more than 6 feet away. But, as long as you keep this in mind and long as your lighting is good - natural light or BRIGHT indoor light, you'll be good to go.

Another reviewer mentioned incompatibility with certain USB ports. I happen to have side-mounted USB ports on my Macbook Pro, so I had no problem plugging in the Flip.

Yet another reviewer mentioned some ideas for improving the camera. Sure, I have some improvements in mind too, but at 100 bucks, I can't complain too much.

My dislikes? I had to press down pretty hard to make the zoom work. This is a minor quip, since the 2x digital zoom is SO not worth even using. Zoom with your feet, people.

The other dislike isn't with the camera itself. I don't mind so much that there's no lens cap, but the cheap velveteen bag provided with the camera tends to shed, so I have had to blow the fabric fuzz off of the lens every time I use it.

I'm not going to comment on the editing software since I haven't used it.

Tres cute! Tres handy. Tres fun.

This is my 1st coffee grinder. It's burrtastic! Thank you to all the previous reviews which helped me come across this terrific Burr grinder. I was originally gonna get a Krups grinder in the assumption it's good and found out through Amazon reviews the one to get is this Capresso's burr grinder (terrific for expresso). 

I am very glad I chose this. It's very quiet, has lots of grind option settings and looks great too! 

Like other reviews have said, it is a little messy but not as bad I had imagined it to be. 

I have found quite a bit of left over grounded coffee in the lower burr chamber. I found if you tilt the grinder forward, with use of the brush, you can relatively easily get the remainder of the grinds out for use.

I can't get over how fresh, great tasting my Starbucks iced latte came out. Just like Starbucks! Worth every penny!

The DVD has two movies on it. One is the original "The Gods must be crazy" made in 1980 and a sequel made in 1989. I would give the original a 5 star  and the second one a 3 star because the first one is very funny and second one is less so. Although the little boy in the second film is very cute.

Both films features a Bushman named Xi who lives in the Kalahari desert and his adventures with the outside world. With parallel stories of a western biologist and a professional woman's misadventures. Xi encountered modern civilization for the first time when he decided throw away an "evil" coke bottle (thrown from an airplane over the desert) to the end of earth. Xi, through his own experience, interpreted the modern world as "people with a lot of magical things" but are "quite illiterate" because they lack basic survival skills (tracking animals, finding water) and they "can't live without their magical things".

The Kalahari desert encompasses much of Botswana and is devoid of surface water except for a short rainy season. Despite its harshness, it hosts a range of animals including elephants, zebras and rhinos. The Kalahari people are one of oldest people in the world. The film portrays them as living peaceful lives without any knowledge of the surrounding world. That is no longer true. The Bushman were forcefully removed from their ancestral land and put in housing compounds by Botswana government in the name of providing better school access. Although their true motive is to open the area for mining. The Bushman have recently won law suits that would allow them to return. The "complete peace and harmony" of the Kalahari people shown in the film is threatened.

The power is great! I can't imagine ever needing to use the 10. 6 is high enough for anything. I went from a 4qt kitchenaid and  I was not ready for the size. I adjusted to it qucikly though when I saw how much faster it mixed things. The sound is a little different that my 4 qt. Like a low whine I guess you would call it. I wouldn't say it's anything that bothers you though. Because it mixes so fast, you don't have it on long anyway. If I hadn't read the other reviews that said it is loud, I wouldn't have even paid it any mind. It's more powerful so I expect it to be a little louder. )
...)I (...)bought one for my daughter too. She is thrilled with hers. She said the red is so vibrant and the mixer works great. Because of Kitchenaids wonderful return policy, I woudln't hesitate to buy from them ever. I read reviews on their website and even after 3 years they were still more than willing to make things right if there was a problem of any kind. They are a wonderful company and put out a wonderful product...

I purchased the Salton yogurt maker because I wanted to be able to control the sugar content in my yogurt (I add sugar-free preserves for sweetness).  Every day or two, I have a batch going on the counter top.  It only takes 6 or 7 hours to make a quart.  The Salton yogurt maker I used many years ago included a thermometer that indicated the correct temperature range for adding the starter.  I still have this handy tool, but it would be very good if they included one with this newer model. Now my whole family is eating homemade yogurt and the maker runs almost constantly!  This great product makes economical, delicious "custom" yogurt.

This product works great.  It does what it is supposed to do.  However, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because its design makes it less convenient with plugging it in next to other USB devices.  It comes with an extension USB cord to solve the problem, but it's just less convenient to have to use this cord every time.  Also, the cap falls off very easily.  I wanted to give it only 3 stars because of its design, but the most important thing is its functionality.  Bottom line: it works.  It just has design flaws.

"Let The Right One In"
(Magnolia Home Entertainment, 2009)
-------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Spoilers below.
-------------------------------------------------
In this slow, sad Swedish vampire film, a gloomy young boy named Oskar falls under the spell of a magnetic child-sized vampire named Eli... Eli moves in next door to Oskar in a large, dull, modern apartment complex where Oskar often flees to escape the cruel attentions of several sadistic school bullies. Eli sees his dilemma, and encourages Oskar to fight back, even though he is too puny to defend himself without resorting to violent, Columbine-like tactics. As Eli's vampirism slowly becomes apparent, both to Oskar and to the angry locals, the two twelve-year-olds -- one eternal, the other mortal -- grow closer and more co-dependent. Although the film is notably low-budget (and poorly dubbed, in the American re-release) it succeeds on a deeper psychological level, as viewers are constantly made to doubt Eli's altruism towards the hapless, vulnerable Oskar. Their puppy-love relationship is complicated by the revelation that Eli (pronounced like Ellie, the girl's name) was once male, a twist that is sure to be left out of the currently-scheduled American remake... Although this film is low-rent and a bit awkward, it packs a potent psychic wallop: fans of Anne Rice's "Interview With A Vampire" (the book, not the film) will love this as well.

As a beta tester for TurboTax I am always amazed how they are able to make it easier to do your taxes year after year. The guidance the software provides is fantastic, simply enter your information and it will ask you additional questions or skips parts. The automatic transfer from last year's data to this year as well as the import capabilities almost puts tax preparation on auto-pilot. There is no reason to go out and have your taxes done if you have access to a computer, this software makes filing taxes fun.(even more so when you are entitled to a refund!)

Setting this up was relatively easy but here are a few things that might help if you're hooking it up to Vista for the first time. This was not mentioned in any of the prior reviews here so I thought I'd mention it and maybe help someone out in a similar situation.

0) Before you start, read through the quick setup completely BEFORE starting. Then scan through all the reviews here on Amazon. Each little tidbit and tip builds into a powerhouse of knowledge and great advice. It'll take some time but believe me, it pays tenfold to find out what to do and what NOT to do before you start.

1) The CD I got listed drivers as v1.01. According to the website, there are only v1.0(XP) and v1.10(Vista). Just to be safe, I downloaded 'v1.10' and used that. During installation however, the release notes seem to indicate it is a ver1.01 so it might just be a typo error on the website.  I would recommend using the website driver anyways as that should always contain the latest version.

2) The Vista installation went through really fast. There wasn't really any explicit message asking to plug the dph50u in. The final install screen said the installation would complete when the dph50u is plugged in but doesn't say when to do it. And then it exits and the software setup ends! What you need to do is plug it into your USB slot after it exits and the actual hardware installation begins. No reboots needed.

3) Next, open Skype goto options->audiodevices and select 'voip capture' and 'voip playback' as your mic and speaker/ringing settings accordingly. 
And that should be it...unless you have a logitech webcam..

4) The logitech webcam software interferes with the audio device settings above and resets them to the default windows audio device when a)skype is restarted or b)after every call ends(ouch!). Two things you can do. Change the default audio device in control panel OR disable your logitech software from starting up (control panel->sys and maintenance->admin tools->sys config->startup tab. Uncheck the logitech items). I chose to do the latter so that we could still use the computer and get sound through the pc speakers while only skype directed audio through the voip phone. I can still use the webcam by manually starting up the software from the programs menu. If all else fails, uninstall the logitech software completely but that also kills your ability to use the webcam.

It's been running continuously for half a day now. No blue screens, no crashes yet. So DLink if you're reading this, good job! Looking at the early negative reviews, this product has come a long way.

This review is from: Fireproof [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)

      




Since this is supposed to be a Christian movie, my immediate urge is to evaluate it on the basis of its doctrinal faithfulness. From this point of view, I would say some evangelicals, particularly Calvinists may have some problems with "Fireproof", specifically on two fronts. Firstly, it is in regard to how to do evangelism related to the doctrine of limited atonement where in this movie, the message "Jesus died for you" seems to be declared indiscriminately which, if one is familiar with Kirk Cameron's and Ray Comfort's "The Way of the Master," they themselves disagree with this approach. Secondly, due to its marriage-centered theme, unless we are careful, we may mistakenly view the gospel mainly or merely to cure troubled marriages through therapeutic programs. 

With this said, however, this movie is one of a few examples where something is better than nothing for at least three reasons. Firstly, it is a family-friendly movie that portrays realities of what happens in most homes as well as godly responsible parents with a genuine care over their children. So if anyone is having a hard time finding a meaningful profanity-free, bloodbath-free, and lewdness-free movie to watch, "Fireproof" is one of the rare few these days. Secondly, with half of all marriages in America ending in divorce and the worldview of marriage as being a contract rather than a covenant, as well as adverse examples from political, religious leaders, and celebrities of their shattered marriages, "Fireproof" is helpful to prevent further damages in society; in particular for singles planning to get married, as well as those facing relationship issues that potentially lead to divorce or even those who have divorced. If there were only a single message, but there is certainly more, to learn from "Fireproof", it would be for couples considering a divorce not to rush to look for lawyers and sign papers. And for everyone, the lesson is that marriage is a covenant to stick together for better or worse, though it may be hard to embrace this covenantal view of marriage unless one understands the gospel, because marriage is an illustration of an eternal relationship between Christ as the bridegroom and the Church as His bride which leads to the third and most important reason, that is, it presents the Christian gospel. If Steven Spielberg spices up his movies with secular humanistic messages; if witchcraft, which is a form of religion, is unashamedly displayed and encouraged in the Harry Potter's series; why can't the public be exposed to Christianity-themed films? Therefore, despite some criticisms of "Fireproof," I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it still.

Diapers are soft to the touch (not scratchy, or paper-like), and very absorbent.  Easy to tell when Baby is wet (feels like there's jelly in his diaper when pinched), and have not leaked yet!  We're onto size 2 now, but we're sticking with Pampers Swaddlers!

I've had Angel's Eyes for about 3 weeks and I can already see an improvement in my dogs appearance. She's a cream colored poodle so the red tear stains were always very apparent. Since I've been giving her the supplement I've noticed a considerable difference. Her eyes still get a little weepy every now and again but I'm confident that with continued use she'll only improve. The only downside is that even though Angel's Eyes is liver flavored, my puppy doesnt seem to like it very much. If i put it in with her breakfast she's sure to finish it before the end of the day but she definitely doesnt attach her food with the same gusto. It could just be that my dog is exceptionally picky. On the plus side, the supplement doesnt make her sick, (she has a weak stomach and tends to throw up just about anything that isn't her regular kibble). All in all, I would definetly recommend this product to anyone with a light colored puppy who has problems with unsightly tear stains.

As I've said in the title, this yoke is great for flightsim enthusiasts.  As such, the review will frame it in this context.

There are two caveats and one suggestion, however:

(1) Numerous reviews here slight the yoke for its inability to clamp down on thin desktops.  I used to have a solid, 2"-thick desktop when I used this (see my MS Flight Simulator 2004 reviews), and it worked beautifully.  I could suggest using either a phone book or block of wood as a caul if your desk is thinner than about 1".  I don't see why a bit of scrap wood and neoprene or a couple of large rubber bands wouldn't hold the yoke quite well.  Remember - my experience with this is in flight SIMULATION - not combat - so I'm not violently jerking the yoke all over the place.
(2) The CH equipment (flight yoke and pedals) ate up 100% CPU on Windows XP PRO, SP1.  This was fixed by installing the software drivers that came with the hardware.  Simple fix, I know, but it was initially alarming to see the CPU get pegged by "a joystick device".

And the recommendation:  Buy this with the pedals to get the full effect.  With features like toe brakes, you can conduct more true-to-life turns and taxiway movement, to say nothing of applying correct rudder to slew around a turn.  I would also recommend buying a powered USB hub with these two devices, as many people have more than just these two devices they'd like to plug into the computer at one time.

This product is awesome, it really is!!  I was in the search for a better and cheaper way to get rid of hair on my legs and searched the internet for hair removal information.  I came across the reviews left for this product and I figured this product was something for me to try. I got it yesterday and I was so excited to try it!  The pain was minimal considering this device yanks hair from the root.  I was expecting much more discomfort and pain.  I did not experience ANY, no lie!  My tolerance for pain is a bit higher than most people I would guess. I do give myself bikini waxes on a regular basis, so maybe that has something to do with it.  But people on here compared it to getting a tattoo, and well, I find that quite hard to believe!  The Braun 5270 Silk Epil X'elle did not leave any hair behind on the first pass along my leg.  The light is a great feature that shines just right and helps to light the way along the skin.  In reading the reviews posted here people complained of the noise, I did not think it was loud at all.  People also complained of red dots and irritation to the skin, so I was expecting something along those lines.  There were NO red dots or skin irritation (which I was expecting) for me.  I did follow the advice of doing it right after a shower, that could have helped.  After I was done, I applied some lotion (non-perfumed) and my skin felt great!  Now my legs will be hair free for weeks rather than days!  This product works so well and I believe it is worth every penny!!

The Breville wok is a very stylish kitchen addition. It is well-designed and well-made. The only drawback of the unit is that at 1500 watts, it doesn't really get hot enough to approximate a real wok over a gas fire. There's not much "sear" going on here. Still, it is a good unit.

Iron Man is an awesome film with great special effects! Everybody did a great job and all the actors were casted perfectly. A billionaire inventor named Tony Stark is held hostage in Afghanistan for months because terrorists want him to build a bomb. Instead, he builds an armor suit so he can escape. He is rescued and and while he is back home, he tries to reinvent the suit. He makes it and tries to figure out how to work it. His sexy beautiful personal assisstant, Pepper Potts doesn't really him to do it, because she thinks he might die, but he tells her that he must do it to save lives. I love all of Iron Man's gadgets. Soon, some military people think Iron Man is a threat, so Tony asks his friend Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to stop the planes from trying to kill him. His other friend, Obadiah Stane betrays him and builds his own iron suit. If you love action, and comic book movies, you'll love IRON MAN!!!

Very nice yoke indeed. I fly Cessnas, so I do have a small complaint. The trim wheel is on the left of the yoke, in the cessna it's on the right. I'd prefer they at least put the trim wheel in the right place and possibly create some actual push/pull throttle and mixture controls.The action on this yoke is fairly well. Much better experience than using a joystick, especially better than a joystick with built in rudder that always twists when you go left/right.Well done!

I couldn't be more pleased with this product. I've been a Kingston user for a long time now, and I decided if I was going to buy a high capacity USB flash, it had to be from this manufacturer. The design is the typical white Data Traveler; it has a wine-redish colour (not the biggest fan of it) but this one has a kind of glossy finish on the logo side I haven't seen on smaller models.
The cap is detachable and you can place it on the back of the stick when in use. It has a strap whole at the back and the cap won't interfere at all with any strap or key chain you can also attach.

Performance-wise speaking, it has a pretty good speed of a USB 2.0 device: I transfered 460Mb in less than two minutes. Next I transfered a whole 4 GB DVD movie in eight minutes or so.

Moving big amounts of small files is always slow, regardless the storage technology. I was surprised with the speed of the Kingston Data Traveler with 1024 small GIF's copied to it. Timing was also descent deleting files and formatting it.

I've read some users are somewhat displeased with the detachable protector cap. I been using this kind of models and I never lost a cap. And I do prefer this to be a solid dongle instead of those with a retractable connector because the latter are prone to collect dirt and debris, and they can be damaged easier than a solid design.

For the price, a Kingston USB with a 16 GB capacity will far surpass your expectations in any scenario.

I had an electric shaver years ago and it was one of those three head types.  I was never satisfied with the shave so I eventually went back to a razor.  When I bought this shaver, I was hoping that technology had improved as well as that this was a quality shaver.

Both I think are true.  The shaver works great with very few exceptions.  I find the shaver gives a very close shave on all parts of my face.  The technology doesn't make it possible to simply swipe the shaver over a check and that's it; you have to pass the saver a number of times for a really close shave.  

A razor gets to the point quicker but also nicks and scrapes a WHOLE lot more.

I have a bit of trouble getting a close shave on the part of my neck just below the jawbone.  I guess this is because that's a fleshy part of anyone's neck and skin gives too much, but you learn how to adjust your pressure and passes.  

The device can't get that spot close to your nose.  It's just logical.  a razor's cross section is like a 1/4 inch where the electric razor head is  more than an inch.  So, for those who have a whisker or two nearer the nose, you may have to still cut that with a razor if yo want to get all the nasty little beggars.

The razor does not provide a way to make that clear straight cut at the end of sideburns either.  So every once in awhile i cut that with a razor too.

Over all I am pleased.  The readout showing shaver state tells you when it needs to be cleaned.  If I follow the little dial readout exactly, I get three shaves before it tells me the razor needs to be cleaned.  I usually go four or five before cleaning.  It doesn;t seem to make a big difference to subsequent shaves.

The cleaning process is fully automated so you just push the button and walk away.

I bought my son a Panasonic that uses water as the solvent for cleaning.  The Braun requires a cartridge with it's own solution formula.  The cartridges last a long time so it isn't a bother to me but my son seems to like the Panasonic just fine so there is an alternative if you don't want to buy special cleaner cartridges.

The battery holds a pretty substantial charge and I have no problem taking it on a week-long business trip with no worry that I need to charge it while on travel.

I am really!! pleased with my yogurt maker.  

Keep in mind that your yogurt will be runnier than brand name yogurts because you will be making it all fresh with no thickening additives (like aguar gum or carrageen).  If you use especially juicy fresh or frozen fruit you will wind up with "drinkable" yogurt.  My 2 year old loves it when I take the drinkable yogurt and freeze it in mugs (cover mug with plastic wrap) and make "frozen yogurt".   It's a great way to get extra calcium into milk reluctant kids.

But most of all, I love the fact that I'm not sending a little plastic cup into the landfill every time I eat 3 spoonfuls of yogurt.

And I really love the great price I got at Amazon.

This is really a great product.  My two short hair tabby brothers love being 'brushed' and we get gobs of fur out of them every week.  They are inside cats.  I keep a sheet or two of a sticky roller handy to catch the combed out fur. It flies around if you're not careful.  I also find it's helpful to use a comb just to capture the fluffs of fur we pull out.  It's more fun now to play with the cats and rough them up because we no longer create a fur storm every time we touch them.  Also nice for lessening the white fur on dark clothes.

Family comedies don't get better than this. Especially comedies with animals. "The Gods Must Be Crazy I" introduced us all to the Coke bottle that nearly destroyed the relationship of the Bushmen of Africa (envy, jealously, greed. None of these emotions were expressed until the man-made bird dropped the Coke bottle from the sky.) "The Gods Must Be Crazy II" worked with a larger budget and worked more with the animals and with N!xau's children.
This is the kind of entertainment that use to bring the whole family together and laugh together just like old times. Yes, there are some gun fights and episodes of war throughout both of them, but it's never really too intense for anyone over the age of 10. It's not traumatizing. This new double feature DVD is definately one of my Top 10 film packages.

I bought this ice cream maker this summer and we've made strawberry daiquiris and strawberry ice cream.  It did a great job with the ice cream - just as good as my old electric-with-ice-and-salt maker.  It was still a little noisy - we banished it to the powder room and shut the door.  Not as noisy as my old maker though.  It was nice not having to run back and forth checking on the ice level every 5 minutes.  
The daiquiris didn't freeze very well.  I suspect it was because we didn't chill the alcohol very well.  All the ingredients should be well chilled, but that is no different than what's required for my old maker.  The can has to be kept frozen if you want to be able to make ice cream at a moment's notice.  I didn't think about that before I bought this and we don't have much freezer space.  However, it doesn't take up more room that a 1/2 gallon carton of ice cream.  (It is a tad taller than the carton.)  If you are tight on freezer space, this might be a drawback.

I needed a network storage, and I wanted some degree of user-extensibility (hackable). After much research, DNS-323 became an obvious choice, at least based on specification, figures, reviews and user reports. The budget was under $200, and it's incredible how expensive NAS boxes are in general.

Here are some models I considered and why they didn't make the cut:
Linksys Storage Link for USB 2.0 Disk Drives NSLU2 an amazingly flexible NAS that's also cheap. It has a very large and healthy development community for its hacks. However it requires external enclosure and is much slower. NSLU2 also doesn't spin down the drives by default (reports say you can with some tweaks). Has the least functions out of the box. Very tempting alternative however, due to its being a favorite platform for hackers/developers and consequently a legendary bang for the dollar.
Linksys Network Storage System with 2 Bays (NAS200) follow up on the NSLU2, has two SATA bays, seemed perfect. However Linksys decided to drop a dog of a chip in there, making it slower than even the old NSLU2 out of the box. The chip is also different and odd compared to NSLU2, making it a dubious candidate for development projects. Heat dissipation is also a reported problem, as well as fan noise. It's relatively new so no development projects (hacks) are centered around it. I wonder with the lackluster hardware if it ever will.
Buffalo LinkStation Pro Shared Network Storage LS-320GL - NAS - 320 GB - Serial ATA-150 - HD 320 GB x 1 - Gigabit Ethernet Has everything--gigabit, speedy processor, large ram-but only 1 bay and comes with a drive that I don't need. Replacing the drive voids warranty, and the drive doesn't spin down (big no). Isn't as well made as there are numerous reports of it failing after a few months. Also a very hackable unit like NSLU2, and were designed to encourage it.

I came into the decision on my DNS-323 with a slight mistrust of D-Link products, after having owned several buggy network hardwares in the past. The justification for the purchase was its reported speed by many, often comparable or beating units more than several times its cost. It's one of the few "budget" boxes that actually delivers the speed it promises. 

It has a 500mhz processor, the Marvell 88X7042 SATA controller and marvell's 88E1111 gigabit network handler. All proven workhorses. a very efficient case design with small volume/footprint, the dual bay sata with raid, standard linux file format (ext2), the ability to spin down and its operating power efficiency. For the money, there's really none other on the radar with these credentials.

Receiving the product is another revelation. I'm the obsessive-compulsive type who can see every single flaw, which tend to be plenty on mass produced products these days. I couldn't find one scratch on the brushed metal sides of this NAS case. The product is very solid, with hefty metallic casing (I don't think you can find any NAS box made of metal under $200.. or maybe even $500), that actually has a suede rubberized finish on top and bottom. The metal case proved to be important as it helped dissipated the heat of the drives as I turned off the fan with scripts later. It is also VERY spatially efficient, with no space wasted. The only gap between the drives were well thought out as cooling channel. I don't think it could get any smaller without hurting its function. The speed-controlled fan is very quiet to the point of being nearly silent; an amazing feat due to its size (40mm). I don't think I have ever seen a small fan that quiet. The lights are discreet, no Christmas colors. The box looked great and exuded quality. I can't complain about the build quality at all. It's just well made with solid components. D-link's accountant must be asleep at the switch.

Installation is easy. You just open the front face cover and slide in the drives. Connect the power and network cable and that's it. It comes with (or you can download) a software that automatically maps the drive for you. (you can do it yourself too quite easily. it's not proprietary in any way) The configuration page is also very straightforward. Perhaps a bit too plain vanilla, but what it has just works. Have been using ftp and itunes server extensively. I haven't tried raid 1 (which reportedly have issues with older firmwares) or the upnp media server. Otherwise I haven't had problems with the firmware, which I upgraded to 1.03. Firmware 1.04 is due soon, and I tried the beta versions as well without yet running into problems.

The speed didn't disappoint. I didn't have a gigabit network at home though, but at the 100mbps ethernet, it registers 99%+ throughput on transfers. It was able to sustain the speed for the entire 400+gb I transferred on initial set up without any breaks or stops. In other words I haven't been able to touch its limit yet. After almost 3 weeks of constant use, there's not one problem on its basic features: storage and serving files over the network. It just does what it should, even if I fancied more imaginative features.

Now the hacking part: I've discovered after my purchase that there's a sizable contingent of users on the web who have tackled and extended the capability of this solid piece of hardware. I really hoped D-link was stronger on their firmware design or implement more features, but it looks like they have had problems and thus became conservative, resutling in the plainness of the standard firmware. 

If you google fun_plug or check out dns323.info, you'll find all the information you need to explore the untapped potential of this rather capable hardware set. I was able to get this little puppy to be a bittorrent client, a web server, upgrade the itunes server, deliver media streaming over http, customize its fan control (it really doesn't run that hot with my wd5000aaks, helped by the metal case. The hack cuts on fan power and the already unnoticeable noise, and maybe even lower dust levels), and use its usb for storage as well as print server; and I just started playing with it 3 days ago! There are also many security enhancements that solves many of the network functional lackings mentioned in other reviews here. Due to the way the firmware is written, you don't even need to change the firmware to attach all these features. I'm not good with hacking, but it's really not that hard for most of these "hacks". I suspect most people can follow the instructions just fine.

To conclude: this is a solid NAS hardware that has a doubter and a miser convinced of its value for the dollar in the course of the past 2.5 weeks. As a basic network storage, this thing works very well. If you venture into the available hacks, you can really make it work like you dreamed it and maybe even more. I am not giving it 5 stars only because I wish D-link provides some if not all these wonderful hacked features to suit its rather robust hardware, and that I only had limited exploration of its features. However, as it stands, it works quite reliably and fast out of the box. That is probably the most important to most people. For me, it delivered.

This is a very good product. I prefer that my knifes are not razor sharp but sharp enough to cut veggies with ease, and this does the job. Never found any other electric knife sharpener for this kind of a price.

I've tried so many and even the high dollar ones are not what you hope for. This one will grind even the dark oil covered beans well without a peep unlike most. It's quieter than most but not as quiet as it could be. The only real complaint is that the little pull out cup tends to walk out during the grinding causing a mess from grounds flying out, so you have to hold it in with your finger while grinding or use a rubber band. Also because the cup is plastic it tends to build up static electricity so if you don't let it sit a minute or so before pulling out the cup, grounds fly out. Still, it's a better grinder than all the more expensive models and cheaper, and there is no comparison with the cheaper / others in the same price range. Until I find a better or five star one, This ones the bomb.

I recently had braces put on and my Sonicare toothbrush just wasn't doing a thorough cleaning job. At the recommendation of my dentist I added the Waterpik to my cleaning regiment. It has made a tremendous difference.  My teeth are spotless and my gums are back in shape. It removes food particles that you don't even know you had.   I would recommend this to anybody and espcially those who have crowns, bridges or braces. 
The one slight manufacturing design flaw I found is the water cord to the handle is on the short side. This becomes an issue if you are right handed and the unit has to be plugged into the left side of your vanity.

The only gripe I have is the plasic clip holder leaves a lot to be desired.    
It fell from my belt and was found in the grass two weeks later - it's still working (probaby because it fell face down which keep rain from entering the unit).  Now I keep in my watch pocket.

Again, it's a really nice device and keeps good scores.

Fabulous toy. My cat loves it, and it's not just because of the catnip either. Whatever it is, it's great to watch her enjoy it so much. As a plus for kitty's 2-legged companions (Us), the catnip goes into a little  velcro-sealed pouch on the underside, so it doesn't get it all over the place. Highly recommended.

I can be very lazy when it comes to doing my hair.  I like to just come out of the shower and go... but my hair type does not let me do that. It can be frizzy. So using this product is the next best thing.  It heats up super fast and is easy to use. After applying some sort of protectant (Frizz-ease), I just slide it down. The recessed plates helps not to burn your ears or face. I have yet to burn myself! And that is saying alot considering how inept I can be. With minimal effort the frizz and fly-aways are gone and with a little more work, I can get it silky straight.  The only down side is that since my hair is thin, getting it so straight does make it look more thin. But it definitely is a great alternative to the wrist-aching feat of blow-drying and much faster.  

Even though it is higher in price, it is money well spent and your hair will thank you!

This works exactly as specified.  Easy to set up--just keep the directions; when you replace the battery, you have to start over.  I purchased this for the security strap because my other pedometer kept dropping to the floor.  The little plastic clasp that attaches the strap to your waistband is after all "plastic", so it broke.  I called them and they did send another accessory kit for no charge, however, I found that I could use the safety strap and attach it with one of those safety diaper pins.  no more crashing to the ground.  I also love the feature where the pedometer automatically resets the step count at midnight.

This tool is very good, but the price is way too high. I guess they have to make a profit. Consider you can get other brands for $20s price range, what makes these so much more expensive? The labor and material costs are not that much different between all the brands. The positive aspects of this one is that it does heat up more quickly and maintains it's temperature. The narrow width makes it easy to style and curl your hair.

I have had trouble sleeping since I was a kid, which has continued on into college. Prior to the purchase I had been experiencing many sleepless nights before classroom presentations from nervousness as well as a general night-owl sleep habit. I stumbled upon this while looking for an oral sleep-aid and figured I'd give it a try based on the reviews. This machine is amazing!!! I wish I had this when I was growing up! The wooshing that it creates seems to take the thoughts out of my restless mind and allows me to sleep much better now. I am very happy I bought this. If you've had trouble with insomnia, give it a try. Don't go into it with high-expectations, just give it a try and I think you may be glad you did. Overall, good buy and quality machine.

I received the bread machine as a Christmas gift and I love all of its features -- but I am unhappy that the nonstick coating has started to wear off -- particularly at the four "ribs" in the bread tray.  This wear is particularly troubling because of all the recent news about nonstick coatings being phased out in the next ten years due to health concerns.  That's my only complaint.

This is the first scale I've purchased in about 10 years and I'm very pleased with it. The features are easy to use (BMI and %fat). I've found it very helpful to be able to track more than just actual weight. It's nice to know how much body fat I'm losing as well as weight. This helps increase my motivation because I can tell I'm not losing just water weight but body fat.

"Let the right ONE in" is poetry on celluloid, it is one of those rare gems that comes along only once in a while.  I am not a big fan of vampire literature, but this story is so beautiful and the film is so well done that it will hunt you for a long time.   It will hunt you, I might add only if you are open to non-conformist, exceptional and personal cinema.   It was a small US release in 2008, and not surprisingly it was overlooked by the Oscars Group.   Is it a horror film? It could be. A love story? Definitely. Thriller? Not really.  It is a film full of surprises, enigma and metaphors.   Especially, I love the brilliant music by Johan S鰀erqvis and the two fine young actors playing Eli and Oscar.   The cat scene? Just have a great time watching it.  The end scene? Always remember, what goes around comes around, but most importantly, as much as possible, or whenever possible: let the right ONE into your life.  Simply brilliant filmmaking.

Easy set-up, fast and it's beautiful. So far, there's no noticeable problem with the computer. When I had problem with networking, HP's technical rep was very polite and stayed with me until the problem was resolved. Although the problem was caused by configuration of the router thereby having to get to Cisco's tech, the HP's rep called me back the next day to make sure that my problem had been resolved. I was lucky to get a nice rep when most of the people have lousy experiende with HP technical rep's.
Also, the price which include $[...] rebate, it is of good value. I am very pleased with the product.

Hopefully both halves of Battlestar Galactica's second season will be issued together in one DVD set soon. But "Battlestar Galactica - Season 2.5" still gets high marks from me for the intense battle of wills between Michelle Forbes's Admiral Cain and Edward James Olmos's Commander Adama, which will determine how the surviving Colonial fleet will protect the humans fleeing from their merciless Cylon foe. This second half of Season Two is important too in playing out the consequences of Boomer's (Grace Park) pregnancy, especially after revelations of her less-than-human origins disclosed during the first season and first half of the second season. President Laura Roslin's  (Mary McDonnell) relations with Commander Adama remain important dramatic fare too, though now the emphasis lies more on her incurable illness and the consequences it might have for a potential successor like Gaius Balter (James Callis). 

Is "Battlestar Galactica" the best science fiction television drama? No, it is quite simply the best drama airing now on American television. Series creator Ronald D. Moore and his crew of writers and technicians have done a fine job keeping intact the edgy, gritty qualities of Season One which made "Battlestar Galactica" popular with viewers. However, I still regard "Babylon 5" - especially from its second through fourth seasons - as the finest science fiction drama ever to air on television. "Babylon 5" series creator J. Michael Straczynski wove such a fascinating, elaborate web of drama and fascinating back-story, with ample religious connotations from Christianity and Buddhism, and discrete references to such science fiction and fantasy classics as "The Lord of the Rings" and "The Prisoner" television series, which has yet to be equalled by Ronald Moore and his crew. Still, I strongly recommend acquiring "Battlestar Galactica - Season 2.5" to those unfamiliar with this series, as well as loyal fans. You will be well rewarded with ten hours of gripping, intense drama that deserve recognition for being the finest currently airing on American television.

Before it was a constant vacuuming at a daily basis. Because of the high amount of shedding from my two dogs, Me and my family always considered leaving them outside always, but sadly they are used to sleeping indoors, or giving them away.

I bought the FURminator out of desperation. But it became the answer to my BIG hairy problem. A week later after using it, just a light daily two minute brush on each of my dogs and I only have to vacuum once a week now. Their coats are gorgeus and always look high maintenance and people have actually asked me who I hired to groom my dogs.

I recommend the FURminator to every Dog/Cat lover, but hates the hairy mess.

My coton de tulear developed horrible tear staining when he was about 5 months old.  I purchased Angels' Eyes and within a month my puppy's stains were completely gone.  My pup is now 10 months old and remains completely tear stain free.  One suggestion- follow the dosing and frequency directions on the bottle!  At first you will have to give it every day, but over time you can reduce to 2-3 times per week and keep the results.

Evaluation: This is an improvement over the ephedra-free version, which basically had no effect on me at all. I feel increased energy throughout the day and taking the second dose at 5:00 PM helps with appetite control at dinner time. We will see if the 7.9% boasted on the label is true by December (my goal).

Progress: I have lost 6 pounds in two weeks 255-249. I sit behind a desk all day. I try to go to the gym 3-4 times per week and play cricket once per week (20-25 overs). I have also made an attempt to reduce my caloric intake to 2500 calories per day, eating better quality foods, and reducing (but not eliminating) my fat and carb intake. I take my doses 1 hour after breakfast and 2 hours before dinner.

Side Effects: About 30 minutes after you take this, your scalp will start tingling. The tingling sensation is much stronger after the second dose each day. Heed the instructions on the dosages, starting off with 1 pill per dose. I have had no trouble sleeping at night, but I do have increased dream activity. As I am taking this with MMUSA creatine serum, I am not sure which (if not both) is causing the excessive dreaming. There are no other side effects that I am aware of.

Disclaimer: The only way to permanently lose fat is proper diet and exercise! This supplement is helping me reach my weight goal. I intend to remain at that goal by controlling my food intake and exercising.

I own this toothbrush and think it is the best toothbrush on the market, well worth the money. I drink a lot of coffee and tea - both stain your teeth - upon recommendation of my dentist I purchased this toothbrush after my last cleaning and to my amazement I have managed to keep the stains off my teeth. My gums were a little sore at first, but they have adjusted to the brush and now I have a beautiful smile, stain free!!! I have owned many electric toothbrushes but this is the best, hands down.

What a great product! I have a very vocal Australian Shepherd puppy and was pushed to the brink of insanity by his incessant barking. I consulted a trainer and nothing they recommended worked so they finally told me to get this. I wish I would have gotten it sooner! It has made our relationship so much better! After 3 weeks, the collar malfunctioned and I had to send it in to Premier. They have great customer service and I am now waiting for a replacement collar (free of charge). I didn't realize how great it was until now - when I don't have it. It has been a LONG few days without the collar. If I try to mimic the sound of the citronella being released by the collar, sometimes he will stop barking, but I'm definitely not a good substitute. The other down side is that the battery is not easy to find (at least in my area - I checked 4 stores before I found one at Radio Shack) - I'd buy one online and also an extra can of citronella, because you won't want to be without them for long.

The Little Mermaid is my personal favorite when it comes to Disney movies. I love having it on DVD and the bonus features are extensive. I would normally rate this 5 stars, but I was a bit disappointed with the cover art. I'm a fan of hand-drawn animation. The cover is very obviously a computer generated version of characters. I wish the cover art matched the animation of the movie. Ariel just doesn't look right. Yes, I agree, this isn't a big deal...but it bugs me a little. However, I still am happy I purchased it!

This gadget was on my amazon wish list for a few weeks. I kept looking at the online information, and visited a local computer store which had a display of a few Eee models, in order to handle them and translate the written specs into 3D for myself.

Finally, the price here dropped a little and on the last day of a rebate offer, I ordered it. I've had my Eee 901 for a few days now and so far, so great! I got the black one, with Linux. Don't have any experience with Linux so I'm on a learning curve; I figured that if I really want Windows, I can always buy an XP OS and install it. But since I mostly will use this to access the Internet, blog, download photos and upload them to my online photo service, and to work with documents and spreadsheets, I think the Linux software preloaded on this sweet little machine will be just fine.

The reviews here prepared me for the small keyboard on the Eee, but I don't have large hands and I'm adjusting to it faster than I had expected. The touchpad is not so great, but I hate touchpads generally and I can't say I dislike it any more than any other touchpad I've used. Today I'm taking the Eee to my office where I left my USB notebook (small sized) mouse and will probably use that instead of the touchpad. 

I just completed my first charge/discharge battery cycle, and was impressed by how long the battery lasted. I charged it up on Friday when I unboxed it, then unplugged it. I used it a bit on Saturday and a lot on Sunday, and finally the battery capacity dropped below 25% on Sunday night. All of that was with wireless enabled, which I understand drains the battery faster.

So far, this is a very portable (and cute, I have to say it) mini-notebook that boots up like lightning, has a user-friendly interface for this total Linux newbie, connects to wireless networks smoothly, and has a display that's big enough for serious internet browsing as well as working with documents and spreadsheets. I bought this to take with me when I travel, but I can see it's going with me around town as well.

Bottom line: if you are not a geek, but a reasonably informed PC user who doesn't need to run specialized software on it, don't be afraid to consider the Eee PC 901 with Linux. You'll get more GB of storage in the machine than comes with the Win XP version of the 901, and a user-friendly interface. Some things about Linux are different but not enough to make me regret this purchase. Not at all!

UPATED TO ADD: The outside surface of the lid is shiny black plastic, which shows smears and fingerprints, and collects scratches. I got this protective decal/skin for my 901: Cruising Design Asus Eee PC 901 Skin Decal Protective Sticker. It fits well, looks nice - no more smears - and protects the lid.

SECOND UPDATE: My Eee came with a cushy fabric slipcase. But the fabric assiduously collects lint, and as a slipcase it doesn't have a carry strap. I prefer carrying a shoulder bag and having my hands free. I've found two bags with shoulder straps which are good solutions for carrying my Eee and accessories, with room for other things as well:

     1.  The Sumdex MT-3 Series Vertical Messenger - which I have been carrying as my main handbag ever since I got it. It's big enough to be useful but still on the small side. It has a padded compartment with a side pocket into which the Eee 901 fits perfectly (and when my Eee isn't in it, my Kindle usually is).  

     2.  The Asus Eee Pc 7-10 Inch Laptop Case by Case Logic, which I think is a good deal for the money and a nice solution for carrying the Eee and other necessities around in something handier than a standard sized laptop case or backpack.

Background: On recommendation from a friend, I purchased this Omega Paw litter box when I adopted a young cat.  When I have lived with cats in the past, I have always been too lazy to clean out the litter box every day.  This litter box has definitely made my life easier, and my cat's life cleaner.

Using the litter box: The box works as advertised.  I simply roll it over, the clean litter filters through the plastic grate on the side, and the clumps collect in the tray ready to be tossed out.

Issues: My cat is medium sized and I think if she were any larger she wouldn't be able to use the box comfortably.  This portion of the box that actually contains the litter is pretty small in size.  Because of the small size I've had an instance where, after a couple of days of not sifting out the clumps, my cat has gotten mad and peed outside the box.  In the future I may purchase the larger size box to give her more room.

The box quality isn't top notch.  When I assembled it I found some of the edges weren't flush to each other.  However I have had zero litter leaks between the seams when rolling the box.  It may not be true for all boxes, but mine seems to work perfectly.

Overall: I would recommend this litter box for those who are a little squeamish about scooping poo or are lazy about scooping out litter boxes the old fashioned way.  I change the box every day now because it is so easy.  Happy owner + constantly clean box = happy cat.

It is a good little camera and the quality isn't bad.  I had hoped to import or move the files to the mac to use these files in imovie.  It is possible to use the files in iMovie, but you first convert them to DV or MP4 format.  Having to convert the file defeats the purpose of the camera to some extent.

This book is amazing. Some things surprised me which I didnt think would happen. Some might not like the book because of these surprises because they already have the characters futures mapped out in their heads.  I love the surprises and things that I never thought of. This is what keeps it interesting because Meyer does not keep it cliche.  If you loved the others and dont have any strong feelings about how "you" would write the book then you should love it like the others.

I always like to play racing games and recently purchased a PS3.  Wanting to wait for the full version of GT5 so I purchased GRID.  Despite that I enjoyed this game with the Sixaxis controller, I wanted to try playing the game with the Logitech G25 as I found this on sale for $200 at the local Fry's.

The game recognized the G25 without any issue.  With the default setting, it doesn't feel natural.  The force is actually too strong.  After trying to learn to adjust to the G25, my time was still better with the Sixaxis controller than the wheel.  Disappointed as I was, I considered returning the wheel to the store.  Luckily, I found an option menu in the game that allows modifying several settings to suit the user.  After playing with the settings for several races, the wheel feels much more natural.  And my time around the tracks is significantly better.

In 2 days, I have won many events/trophies in the game.  Now that the controller is adjusted to my liking, the experience during play cannot be matched by using the standard controller.  The steering wheel set is very well made.  I have not tried the other steering wheel systems, but I highly recommend this.  It will elevate your racing game experience to a new level just as it did for me.  I cannot wait for the full version of GT5.

I will not expound upon the really incredible video captures here.

However, as another noted, there is a real sameness to the structure:  Food and procreation, ad naseum.  If I heard 'world's biggest..largest...etc' less than 60 times in this series, I would be astonished.  The narration is rather dull (not in performance but in the script).  The musical contribution is variable and sometimes pointless.

One cannot but wonder in awe at the dedication that produced this, however.

In the end thanks to Philips for such a nice product..I wonder where can I get mineral oil for cheap though..I have many such devices which recommend using it after interval...

I loved Dorothy and her little dog, Toto, and her three new friends, Scarecrow, Tinman, and the cowardly lion. And most of all loved the music.  As I grew up and continued to watch the annual t.v. viewing of it, I was able to watch the whole thing but in Black and white! At the time it didn't bother me as I loved the fantasy of it all and it had appealed to me so well.  Then one year, I was invited to my best friend's house to watch it, well, all I can say is WOW.   The colors! They actually made the story all that more my favorite movie.  Through the years I watched it less and less but always treasured it as my absolute favorite movie of all time.  My husband bought me this dvd, and it is just an amazing feast for the eyes.  With oodles of extras to watch, even some parts that originally met the editting floor show up here, this is just a perfect dvd to add to your collection.Even if the dvd didn't have all that supplemental stuff, I would still love it. The movie just sets the imagination free and let's you go with it.  I sing a long with the entire cast and have a ball!  The witch doesn't scare me anymore, and I watch it on a 42 inch screen so I am getting a pretty good showing.I highly recommend this dvd. It's a perfect family film and for any fans of older movies, this is the one to have.  It will not disappoint in the least. I've only met one person in my entire life that didn't like this movie.  What's not to like?  You have a good story, motivation, fun songs to sing a long with, awesome acting by all in it, and glorious cinematography. It's a wonderful film that will remain forever in my heart and always remind me of my youth."There's no place like home", Dorothy says.  I say, "Tthere is no movie like this one."

A hands down favorite of my dogs. Glucosamine & Chrondrotin is a favorite recommendation from my vets. No better way to get it than in a tasty chewy (not hard) treat.

This is one saga of books that is so interesting, it takes virtually no time to read, leaving the reader wanting even more. I saw the movie first, thought it was so very good (this woman threw out all the old rules about vampires, people and werewolves and created a whole new genre'!) I am no teen, and I was entranced, as I think anyone who reads the first book will find themselves, I was given the first book, bought the second next day delivery, because I simply could not wait to read the next book, and was given the final two to read, I will eventually buy my own final two books so that I have the whole set to keep in my collection. I reccomend these books for anyone who wants to be swept away, which is what we do when we read anyway, there could have been no better venue for this that this saga. Anyone who picks these up, in my opinion, will NOT regret the fantasmic draw of the writer. I honestly don't know how she will be able to top what she has done with this retreat from reality, but if she is able I would love to find out! Happy reading to anyone who finds themselves entwined in this storyline. I think there will (again, as I have said) be no regrets, only that it doesn't keep going!

I have been using the Deluxe version for more than 10 years working as an employee, software consultant, and at times a mixture of both.  With all the IRS rules each year, the complexity of TurboTax has grown.  2007 was the most difficult for me to use and I had to recheck the individual forms more than any year to ensure I entered the correct information.  It seems that their are several areas that could be improved on when running multiple small businesses.  One of the areas is depreciation or mileage of vehicles used in more than one business.  Very easy to double up expenses.  One of the the areas I like the most is with the importing of Stock trades.  I have not found another product that will allow you to access your brokerage account and import all your activity.  This saves so much time, it's easly worth the $50+ just for this feature.  
Overall, this is a very good product and will continue to use it, even if I had to pay more to file additional returns.  But, I am glad there is competition to make sure this 500lb gorilla listens to its client base.

I tried the Tassimo but did not find the coffee to be strong enough.  There also weren't as many coffee choices.

Keurig B60, however, is an excellent machine. The coffee is strong and hot and the choices of coffees is immense.  Just the variety pack that comes with the machines shows how many options there are.

The unit is easier to use than the Tassimo, also.

After letting this movie digest for a while after all the hype, I thought I could make an honest review to the best of my ability.  I'll break it down into 2 parts: the movie and the blu-ray.

The Movie
I've watched The Dark Knight 4 times now and it still doesn't disappoint.  It has taken the comic book genre and the Batman series to another level.  The standout performance obviously is Ledger, in an unforgettable performance that will definitely stay with you days or even weeks after.  This is the joker's movie.  I can still hear his catchy little quotes in my head ("Why so serious", "Here weeeeee go", etc.).  He has left us with gift and I'm sure his career was only going to get better.  What a tragedy.

Bale slightly edges out Keaton as Batman, but I preferred his performance better in Batman Begins, which offers much more depth to the character.  Be of the rich plot and excellent action sequences, TDK is a better movie, but Begins is a better "Batman" movie.

Overall, this is the best movie of the year...quality acting and an epic story.

The Blu-ray
There is a lot of controversy among HD fans about the use of edge enhancement (EE) on this transfer.  On my Panasonic 42", it looks flawless.  The aspect ratio changes do not hinder the experience but only add to it.  

The thing that is lacking the most is the special features.  No true behind the scenes featurettes, no Ledger tribute, and no behind the scenes footage of his performance for that matter.  A total letdown.  I'm sure these additions will be available on the inevitable double-dip.

This is my 1st HD camcorder and it has yet to disappoint.  After using the "movie" mode on our point-and-shoot Nikon, this is a breath of fresh HD air!  My wife and I just had our first born and we wanted to catch everything our little man does! The HF100 is perfect...small, lightweight and easy to use.  My wife is somewhat intimidated my technology(she does not touch my Canon 40D) but she has little issues with this camcorder.

I usually shoot 30P in Program mode with the image stabalizer on.  Program mode will give your shot far better color contrast and 30P is much easier to convert for web uploading than 60i.  60i looks good on DVD but most videos I shoot end up in Vimeo for my family to watch, most of which live hours away.  

Uploading is a breeze with the flash drive.  I purchased a cheap flash drive reader off an auction site.  For whatever reason you have to have the camera plugged in when uploading movies to your computer.  That is a lot of cords. A memory card reader is cheap and a major life saver.

I have both a Mac and a PC so I have some experience with both platforms when viewing video.  One major complaint is that AVCHD is somewhat difficult to view on a computer.  You do have to convert it to another format to view your movies on a Mac and even to edit them.  I use Toast 9 along with Quicktime Pro to convert my video to a format easily uploaded to Vimeo(H.264 - 1280X720 HD). The quality is astounding!

In its RAW format, AVCHD looks excellent.  The bundled video software(Windows only...dang) does a great job with unconverted AVCHD playback and some editing. I wish they would make a Mac version of this software. I have even made a DVD with the software and it looks really great on my Plasma.  For bare bones editing, and DVD creation...the bundled software does work, and works well.  One thing I have noticed when converting AVCHD to a more friendly video editing format such as HDV with TMPGEnc 4.0 Express is some stuttering when panning video is being played.  This does not happen when viewing in AVCHD format.  My suggestion, unless you really have to, try not to convert the video unless necessary.  SONY Vegas video software lets you edit in AVCHD, no conversion is necessary.  If you are on a Mac...well as far as I know a program does not exist that allows editing in AVCHD...you have to convert the file to something else (video codecs are numerous).

Eventually AVCHD will be the format of choice as tapes will inevitably be phased out (some will argue this, but this is my personal belief). In my opinion you cannot go wrong with this camera.  Hard drives fail, tape drives fall apart and RW-DVDs are a pain.  Flash memory is the future.

One issue I have is the lack of a stand alone plug in for the battery.  You have to plug the camera in to charge your camera's battery unless you shell out around $60 for a separate plug in charger.  In my opinion this should have been included with the camera.

This is absolutely the very BEST BRUSH for long haired cats and boy I have tried everything! It really gets big matts out. I would recommend you petting while you are working the brush. This is what keeps Fluffy happy and still for me.

This is the greatest invention for pets on the planet!  We have two cats, one long haired and the other short hair.  It did a great job on both!  The only thing you need to watch out for is the static cling.  After we furminated both cats there was probably as much hair on me as there was on the floor.  I think I'll use Static Guard on my clothes next time!

My wife first discovered The Secret while watching Oprah.  She forgot about it shortly after until some very trying times came up with her aging parents. She needed something to help her cope and The Secret came to her mind so she ordered the book. After the book she ordered the video. I have never seen her so committed to a concept in all of our 32 years of marriage. 
After realizing how happy she had become and after receiving several unexpected checks in the mail, I decided to give it a try. I must say I have not been so happy and content since I was on antidepressents.
The video is certainly dramatic at some points (some would say melodramatic)and I'm sure the intent is meant well. They intend to capture the attention of millions who can't react to something unless it is sensationalized on film...such is our society. The truth is still there.
In my carreer as a manager for many years, I have read and viewed hundreds of inspirational and motivational books and films. In truth, I've heard it all before. Somehow this film has captured not just the intellectual side of things but the emotional and spritual as well.
Some of the images in the film are absolutely stunning (I suspect stock footage in many scenes). The music reaches deep into your emotions. The true pleasure of the film, to my mind, are the teachers who appear. They are strong, positive, electrifying personalities who are extraordinary in their committment. 
My personal favorite is Lisa Nichols. She simply exudes hope and love and success. She gripped my heart and mind more than any other. Others that spoke clearly to me were Bob Proctor, Jack Canfield, Dr. Joe Vitale. This is not to detract from the others, who are powerful messengers in there own ways.
My wife and I have set some very specific goals for the universe. We expect fully to achieve them and will update this review at that time.  We have shared this concept with our children and a few others.  Many scoff at the idea and we do not preach. We expect to demonstrate by example.
If you are looking for hope, health, happiness, peace, wealth you can get a great start with The Secret

I had purchased this same item 2 years ago at PetSmart -and boy was it costly!  I searched online and found this one at almost a quarter of the price I paid for the first one!  Also, before you purchase a crate you would be well advised to read customer reviews on them -Thank goodness I did!  My Lab/Retriever/Newfoundland puppy would have bent the wire on the Life Stages crates now at PetSmart!  The customer reviews had complaints about that, so I kept looking for the exact one I already have.  I couldn't be more pleased with the product -the divider that comes with the crate is priceless!  As my puppy grows and learns that the crate is his "den" I can allow him to have more room.  I use the divider in my first crate to separate my 2 dogs now -the puppy and dog get along well, but the puppy has "messed" in that crate without the divider because there was so much room. So with the divider in place, both dogs can be crated happily in one crate in the living room, and the second one is for the puppy at night in the bedroom.

Ok First Thing i do is take it out of the box, so far so good ha, after a few miniutes with the cd badda bing badda boom. it all powered up and working fine with my two wired PC. Wireless well i had a few problems like every time i tried to connect to the network i had just set up windows would locate it but when it came to connecting it wouldent let me connect even though i was using the same WEP keys, well after about 5 mins reading the manual on the cd i just reset the station and well the rest is how you would say history, works fine ever since that one little problem, never has disconnected from any wired or wireless and so for 39.99 after rebates (i got it at best buys and they had it cheaper) where can you go wrong. Linksys did a great job on this one and i think im going to buy one of their access points too. i hope this helps you deciede what you want to do.

Although this is a new purchase, and I've only used it for just over a month, it is the single best game controller I've had for my PC. I have several other Logitech devices in use on the 2 PC's in my home, and both have been performing flawlessly for over 2 years. This game controller was a stretch for me, I've never had much faith in cordless hardware. This unit may as well have a cord attached to it, it responds better than the Gravis controllers I've had (5), and the action on the joysticks is profoundly accurate. Durability is still in question, since I've only put 30 hours on this unit. My PC is a Dell Dimension 8200, running XP Home edition with service pack 2 already installed (CD version, minimal install). The games I play are Mechwarrior 4 and expansions, NASCAR games. The driving games have been hard to get used to, the controller responds so quickly that I'm not used to that amount of precision. For the price you pay, you can't go wrong. Especially if you're familiar with the Sony Playstation controller.

I bought one of these while pregnant w/our five-day-old daughter, and I never had anything like it w/our first two daughters.  Let me just say, this one simple product renders ANY OTHER blanket obsolete.  It's soft, pretty, cozy, easy to use (I was always lousy at swaddling w/regular receiving blankets!), impossible to get out of, and she loves it.  I'm going out tomorrow to buy five more, LOL.

I put this item on my wish list as a total luxury item, thinking I would never receive it.  I also wondered if the thing would ever work the way one would hope. How could it for the price?  Well, I got it and it works perfectly and I love it!!!  

I was in the market to upgrade my Sony Handycam for a pricey digital recorder this year, but forget it now.  I don't need it if I have the flip.  

I am not a computer geek by any stretch of the imagination so I'm I'm not going to go into all the technical specs on this recorder, except to say that to the lay person, the video quality is very good.  I think others have done a fine job reviewing the technical specs!  I'm just a Mom - looking to record family moments - although I do know my way around a computer. 

Anyway, as another reviewer reported, it took me less than 2 minutes to get this thing up and running out of the box on Christmas Day when I opened it.  I loaded the batteries (no charging!), turned it on, pushed the button to record and BOOM....there I was.  I recorded several clips and then held my breath when it was time to upload.  Well, to my surprise, that was a snap too. My computer recognized the device right away (I run Vista OS), it transferred the files and opened to the thumbnails!  I clicked the thumbnail and a clip played...just like that.  I couldn't believe it!  Could not have been easier!!  

The device itself has several great features too.  When you boot it up, it tells you how much record time you have remaining.  It has an auto shut-off after a couple of minutes but boots up very quickly - so no missed moments!  You can also go back and review and delete a video right from the recorder (without the computer). Every time you stop and start the recorder it creates a new clip, which is also really nice!  It is small and lightweight - fits in a larger pocket or you can hang the cover (that comes with it) from your belt.  My unit is pink/white, which I love!  :-) It does NOT seem to hog batteries either.  I have a set of AA batteries in it now (the kind meant for electronics - so slightly longer life) and I have recorded over 30 minutes of video and done several playbacks with no problem.  Although, I don't really see a battery life indicator so I don't know what kind of warning system there is or how much life I have left in them. I also have not tried to take it to a kiosk to copy onto a CD yet...but I have read other reviews that say that's a snap too.  

The primary reason I wanted a digital recorder was to share videos with family out of town.  So, I tried sending a video clip through email but the file was way too large and they all came back as undeliverable.  However, I don't think this is an issue with the recorder...I'm sure it's the user and/or the file size!  Maybe there's a way to compress it but I didn't mess with trying that.  Instead, I just uploaded the file to a photo sharing site (I used photobucket) and shared it that way.  Again, worked perfectly!  I think the device is even meant to share easily with certain sites/providers but I like photobucket. 

The bottom line is that if you are thinking of trying this device...do it!  You will love it!

I've been using ON 100% Whey for about a year now, and I will continue to use it.  It's a great product, goes down well, and in combination with my 5x per-week lifting routine I've noticed great results.

I've tried chocolate, vanilla, and cookies 'n cream.

They were all pretty good, but my favorite is the chocolate.  While the vanilla one tasted fine, for some reason no matter what I mixed it with (whether it be water or milk) I would always have a TON of foam after mixing it; I would then have to let it sit for a few minutes for the foam to turn back into liquid.  So, beacuse of the foaming issue with the vanilla one, I think I might go back to chocolate.

But still, it's a great product and I will continue to try other flavors as well.

I highly recommend Frontline Plus! I have tried many different flea products on my cats and Frontline Plus is the ONLY one that got rid of the fleas. 
I used it last summer, then quit using it, but this spring the fleas came back and before I knew it both my cats were badly infested with them. I started using it again, and after using it for a couple of months the fleas are GONE! I have decided to use it year round, so that it will help my cats from getting them next spring. 
The price seems high to most people, but it is well worth the money. It cost a lot more to get the same thing from my Vet.

I purchased the Tassimo machine in December, 2008.  I loved it, especially the fact that I could order Starbucks coffee for it.  Then, I began to experience a little disappointment, since I was limited in coffee selections.  Lots of good coffees, but not many flavored coffees. I love tea, but Tassimo doesn't have that great a selection of teas.  

Then, I started reading about the Keurig.  Bad move.  I began to lust for the Keurig in my heart.  I read about all the selection of flavored coffees and teas, and rationalized that I needed both machines.  (Okay, we know I don't need both machines.)  An unexpected refund from Uncle Sam came in the mail, and I decided that the Keurig was mine.  Oh, how I wish I'd bought this unit first.  

1.  The Keurig comes with 18 samples.  The Tassimo comes with a brochure that shows you how to order free samples.  

2.  The Keurig is so easy to get started - easier than the Tassimo.  

3.  The Keurig doesn't keep dripping after the coffee is brewed.  Unfortunately, the Tassimo does.  

4.  The Keurig brews wonderful tea - I got the lemon blueberry and it's scrumptuous.  Tassimo doesn't have herbal teas.  

5.  The Tassimo water reservoir has a handle and is easier to carry and fill.  The Keurig unit is a pain.  I use a pitcher now to fill it.  

6.  The Keurig is a prettier machine.  Cute little blue lights.  The Keurig unit is bigger.  Tassimo is more compact.  

7.  The Keurig has to warm for about 3 minutes before the first cup.  The Tassimo has an instant on that requires no wait time.  

8.  The Keurig K-Cups are smaller to store.  The Tassimo T-Discs are cumbersome.  The Starbucks coffees come in a square cardboard box of four t-disks, with three cardboard packages per package. Lots of packaging.

9.  The Keurig unit allows you to choose what size cup you want.  The Tassimo reads the bar code of the disc and selects the appropriate cup size.  I like to select my own size, so this is a pain.  The Tassimo allows you to add more water to the cup, however, which the Keurig does not.  

10.  The Keurig unit does not come with a water filter.  The Tassimo does.  However, I have filtered water, so I don't use it.  

Altogether, each unit has strengths and weaknesses.  I really don't like the water reservoir on the Keurig.  I don't like the wait time.  But everything else is perfect or superlative.

I had my doubts but this player has proven itself to be easy to use and reliable.  The best thing is that it uses a standard AAA battery which you can get anywhere; this is especially good for travel to foreign countries.  No software is needed and you can upload songs from any computer! The ear phones are not the best; the type that hook on you ears are more comfortable; this cause some pain and irritataion especially when sweating heavily.  The case that comes with it looks real flimsly but work very well and seals out the rain. The only negative for the case is the dificullty in removing the player to change the battery.  That is probably a good thing as you know the play will stay in place securly.  The buttons are great; very easy to use while exercising and very reliable in thier fuction.  The unit doesn't shut off accidently and forwarding to the next song is very easy while engaged in physical activities.

LITTER LOCKER is a great product. I have two cats so I empty the bag from the container once a week. (just using the handy cutting tool inside the litterlocker, tie a new knot, and empty the old one and set to go!!) If if you have one cat, it can be emptied once every two weeks. The bag cartridge will last a LONG time (about a month for two cats). When bought in bulk (package of 5), it's much cheaper. 

LItterlocker has made cleaning up the litter box a snap. No more grocery baggies and going outside every single time. Once twist of the handle, poo is gone and it really is air tight so no odor!

Finally, fans of GWTW get what they've so desperately craved.  What a wonderful set this is.  I can't tell you how happy I am to have all of this additional material.  For someone as deeply in love with this film as I and so many others are, all material is good material, no matter how trivial it might seem.  I ripped the package open and watched voraciously from beginning to end.  Everything.  And it was wonderful.  Anyone, ANYONE who loves this movie should own this.  It's been long enough in coming, after all.

I purchased this trimmer as an upgrade to my older T900 model. The vacuum definitely reduces the mess. It's not perfect even on turbo but catches nearly 90% of what previously was 100% of hair on my sink. The turbo is not that loud (no significant difference between normal mode and turbo). My one observation is that the moustache trimmer attachment seems less precise than the one on the T900 however it can still produce the same results. Although the mechanics look the same this one felt like it delivered a smoother shave than my older model. Less mess, lighter device, overall this is an acceptable upgrade.

Wonderful product.  The breeder of my lab suggested Zymox.  If your dogs ears smell & are infected.  (most likely yeast)  Zymox clears it right up.  The wash works great too.

If you have a cat that is nervous or aggressive, I sincerely recommend this product.  I spray it in the areas where my cat sleeps or sits a lot and after a while, he calms down, is much more relaxed and happy.  My cat is extremely aggressive, I almost got rid of him because he was so difficult to live with.  After using this product, I was able to become friends with him.  Now he is my buddy.  I still rely on this product though because he still has the aggressive streak that pops up when I am not using Feliway.  It lasts a long time, I would say 1 bottle lasts me
6 months or more.

This review is from: Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)

      



After the Furious Five fiasco, Dreamworks has decided to give you all the goodies--and more--in the Blu-Ray release of Madagascar 2.  Not only do you get the behind-the-scenes, commentary, and other extras of the DVD, you also get the two Penguin cartoons from the 2-pack DVD bundle...and...

Easter Eggs!  Go to the Penguin episodes menu.  Highlight an episode.  Move the directional controller on your remote and a penguin appears!  Each episode will let you slide off the menu to two penguins, for a total of four extra "short" animations that launch when you select the penguin.

The Penguin episodes (and shorts) are hilarious.  The quality of the Blu-Ray version is eye-popping:  while Kung-Fu Panda produces lots of color and detail, Madagascar 2 goes it one step further with some pretty amazing depth of focus.  Some of the panning shots, for example, seem to pop off the screen.

In addition to all this, BD Live will connect you to other extras:  we watched a pretty good short documentary about lions, for example.  The way the menu is built makes me think there might be more to come.

If you haven't seen this movie yet, Madagascar 2 is a bizarre and hilarious sequel.  It introduces new characters, keeps the favorites from the first, and adds yet more movie spoofs and references for the grown-ups, some of them obvious (the Lion King) and some more obscure (The In-Laws).  If you're buying for a small child, chances are they might not follow the nuances of blu-ray:  the DVD will upscale enough on most players.  But for the best experience, this blu-ray is the version to buy.

Why Bother?: Maybe you will find it as useful as I have and throw out your todo lists, day planners and scraps of paper on your nightstand. This simply-titled book started something of a revolution in the tame world of personal organization. In the words of an article in Wired, Allen inspired a "new cult for the information age".

Core ideas: The inspiration for this book was a realization by Allen that until the `information age' most people worked at jobs where achieved tangible outcomes such as building a house, cooking a meal or healing a patient. Today, the typical information worker rarely gets that feeling of accomplishment. Even people working in traditional occupations suffer from this malise: a vague and constant feeling that there is something you need to get done though you are not sure where to start, nor if you are making progress once you do.

Allen devised a simple system that allows people to get all of that stuff out of their head. He discourages priority based todo list. A lot of the stuff we worry about is the little stuff, such as the birthday present to buy for a relative or a library book to return. The first step is to throw all of that "stuff", no matter how minute or mundane, into a "bucket". These are then filed into folders with tangible, well-defined outcomes, thrown away or saved for reference. There is a lot more to his system and Wikipedia does a fairly good job of explaining it. Or if you prefer a hands-on introduction to his system over reading about it, install ThinkingRock.

I was skeptical when I heard that the Sci-Fi channel was working on a "new" Battlestar Galactica.  I had been a fan of the original as a kid and even though that one was cheesy it still had a special place in my memory.  I should not have worried.  The new Battlestar takes everything that I loved about the original, removes the cheese, and makes it darker and more realistic.  I love this show.  This show is actually what I had hoped for with Star Trek Voyager, but of course never got.  A ragtag fleet, on its own, trying to survive against a superior enemy.  I love the way the mythology is developing and I know this will be a classic for years to come.  The stories on the show are so well done that they are accessible for everyone, even those who do not like traditional sci-fi.  Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.

This is really handy for do-it-yourself computer operators.  It was a decent price for 500GB, though it would have been more reasonable for a full TB which is really what you'd need these days.  Plug and Play, even comes with built in software for backup, etc... Quiet and functional.  It would have been awesome if it had built-in retractable plugs (USB & Power).

I couldn't have imagined how great this book turned out. Stephanie Meyers is a very talented author and I am so sad that I won't be able to continue reading Bella, Edward, Renesmee, and Jacob's story. On the other hand, this was the perfect ending. I feel as though, as sad as all sagas that come to an end are, this ending allowed me to come to terms with a finale. I will always want more, but am satisfied that the story ended this great. If you ever get the chance to read it do! Over, and over again. As I tell all of my friends, once you start reading the Twilight books you will be obsessed and this book is no exception. Well done and thank you for giving us this amazing ending, Stephanie!

This device allows both storage and transfer of data at a high rate of speed. Computers have a limit on the number of IDE devices, and desktop computers have a limited number of bays. The disks may be replaced to provide vast storage within the 250Mb limit. This device may be connected when power is on. The fastest transfer is with an internal IDE ZIP device. The 250 unit can read and write the more popular 100Mb ZIP disks as well. If your unit has a power supply be sure it is connected before inserting the plug into the USB device.

The "User's Manual" warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk. Use the Iomega "Copy Machine" program. Right click on the ZIP drive to select the Iomega "Format" function. Use "Short Format" to delete all data on an Iomega disk. The "Long Format" repairs a drive with errors, converts from another format, or removes all passwords. "Write Protection" protects against writing over data, a password can protect against both reading and writing files. You can also flag the ZIP drive as "non-removable" so it appears like a hard drive. The manual has the details.

Iomega ZIP drives have their drive letter(s) assigned after the hard drive, this changes the drive letter(s) assigned to CDs [Windows 98]. A USB drive has its drive letter assigned after the CD-rom drive letter(s) [Windows Me or newer]. This is the optimal unit for most people. Will the data on a disk survive for over a decade? Not with some floppy disks. Few hard drives survive 10 years of daily use. All your important data files should be copied from a hard drive to ZIP drives or other media. ZIP drives, like floppies, should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat. CDs can be damaged by high heat. ZIP disks are reusable, replacing data does not decrease the size. A CD disk consumes space when a file is replaced. Both can have labels. Some say ZIP drives are obsolete, but not as long as they are useful to you. 
Nobody makes plastic cases to hold a dozen ZIP drives.

I bought this ice cream maker because it was in my Gold Box. It has turned out to work RATHER well. We've made some GREAT ice cream and I've been quite pleased with it. My only cautions are:--If you plan on making ice cream more than once a week (or more than one kind of ice cream at a time), you will need more than one freezer bowl.--It can take several days to entirely freeze the bowl. Make SURE that the bowl is frozen SOLID (so when you shake it, you don't hear liquid sloshing around) before you make ice cream or it won't freeze all the way and you'll be left with chilled slush.

This is the BEST, and ONLY wireless router you should buy. After NIGHTMARES with Netgear N wireless routers, and Tons of problems with Linksys, I tried on of these. Boy, it is like DAY and NIGHT! First the Netgear Wireless (which use to be good) is now TOTAL JUNK, put your wireless netgear in the garbage. Also, Linksys is very bad too. This Wireless router performed exellent in a variety of areas, with a variety of network cards. Don't like like a Newbie and buy a netgear or linksys, look like a genius when you buy this 655. The speed is incredible through this thing, although my main concern was connectivity. Flawless all around, works with ever environment, and every card I threw at it. Works through walls. This is the new Defacto brand to buy, don't buy anything else but this router. As a matter of a fact, don't even buy newer models of the D-Link unless they have reviews like this one! I used to HATE wireless until I bought this router, because I was tired of getting all the phone calls from employees who couldnt connect to our servers. Problem is solved now, never any calls, never any drops. Speed is INCREDIBLE! Highly Recommended!

I've waited for this animation to be released on dvd ever since I heard of possibility of dvd invention years ago. I've loved it that much. I finally got this dvd and it's like a dream come true. I too was a bit disappointed  by its lack of 'side dishes(special features)', which never stops me loving  this film. What a lovely story! How wonderful the music is! This dvd is a  must have. P.S. A video pause in chapter 17 is not a glitch. It is the  very moment for switching to the other layer.

I fix computers for a living, so I see about five or six dead cable routers per month. Many brands -- and I'm not naming names here -- are so unreliable that their "half-life" is about 8 months. I had so many routers fail under warranty that I tell the customers to buy their own router for me to install: I lose the profit, but I avoid the warranty work.
When I simply must buy and resell a router, it's usually a Netgear WGR614. It's reliable, versatile, and easy to configure. I can set it up as a router or an access point, and my favorite feature is that the wireless radio is turned OFF by default: other brands establish an unsecured WLAN as soon as you plug them in.
If you're looking for high speed and gaming features, surf the other reviews. If you want a router that just works, buy a Netgear WGR614. I sell them, and I'm writing this review over one.

Just got mine today. I wasn't expecting such great quality. This thing is built extremely well. It's rock solid. Nothing cheap feeling about it. I installed the 2GB of memory without any hastle. For the price I am really shocked at what you get. Way to go Asus. The keys are half sized of standard sized keys. But what do you expect? Do you want a mini sized laptop or do you not? Yeah a 10' screen version will have standard sized keys but it will also be a larger laptop. I wanted something as small as I could get. And this is it! 5 stars from me.

I loved this book it was a great way to wrap up the twilight series. This book had several twists that I didn't see coming at all. Several people have been saying that SM tried too hard to end the series on a happy note, and as a result the plot suffered. While the story did end on a happy note, the plot didn't suffer. This was a great book and a great way to end the series.

This is my first non-Braun coffeemaker.  Had it for about two weeks now and very pleased.  I like the flip top lid, easy to remove the filter and coffee basket.  The water bin is a bit awkward to reach, have to be a bit careful in spilling water.  There is a number of cups water guide in the water bin, but unless you are looking directly down at it it's very hard to see.  It makes good tasing coffee.  Warming plate has three adjustable settings which is also nice.  Cleanup is very easy with the Cuisinart.

Like many others here, I use this gamepad for emulators. I am pleasantly surprised by the compatibility - it works with every emulator I've tried it with (MAME, SNES9x, Nester, Gens, VColeco, Stella). There are no drivers to install if you own Windows XP - detection is flawless. 

The button action is good enough to accurately simulate the feel of, say, an SNES controller or a NES controller. The d-pad is just slightly inferior to those original controllers' pads, but only ever so (no one has truly gotten it right since the big N did in those days). The buttons have enough of a digital click to them, without going overboard. They strike a great balance between click and mushiness. 

This gamepad is shaped comfortably, like a PS2 pad minus the dual analog sticks. While it is light, it is not flimsy - squeezing and twisting your hands on the plastic produces very little "give" on the thick plastic parts.

I also like the pad aesthetically. The dark blue plastic is handsome and the shape is pleasing to the eye. This might seem silly, but if you're going to look at the thing resting atop your PC for months or years, it's at least a minor factor.

If, as is currently the case, this pad is available for $10 with Super Saver Shipping, you should not hesitate. For $10 or under, this gamepad is a steal!

Recently I picked up an ASUS Eee PC 4G (701) model micro laptop.  I thought that it was an interesting concept that might be able to fill a gap in the market.  After running the notebook through its paces, I must say that I am very impressed with this "little machine". 


The Machine
Let's first look at the specifications of the machine.  It is approximately 9"x6.5"x1", or roughly the size of a book; and it weighs in at roughly 2 lbs.  It is powered by an Intel Celeron M 353 (Dothan) socket 479 processor rated at 900mhz with 512K L2 cache.  Earlier models shipped from ASUS had the processor underclocked to 630mhz, but ASUS has since released a BIOS revision that allows manipulation of the FSB so that owners can run the processor at a full 900mhz.  The machine also comes with 512MB DDR2 RAM, a 4GB Solid State Drive (2GB or 4GB on Surf models), built in webcam (not available on Surf models), 10/100 LAN, 802.11g WiFi, internal MMC/SD(HC) card reader, 7" LCD WVGA screen with a resolution of 800x480, and three USB2.0 ports.  The laptop also supports video out (VGA), had headphone and microphone jacks and comes with a modified version of the Xandros Operating System installed (although ASUS provides all of the drivers for Windows XP and instructions on installing the operating system).

Impressions
My first impression of the machine was that it was a little larger than I had thought it would be.  This was not a bad thing, just unexpected.  I charged the machine and then set to work learning it.  Being a Linux user, I was already familiar with Xandros, the operating system installed on the Eee.  One of the things that ASUS did was create a tabbed interface with large icons on the Eee, making navigation similar to that of a PDA.  If someone has never used Linux before, this would make navigating the computer very, very easy.  In fact, it is called "easy desktop mode".


Logging onto my home wireless network was very easy, I just entered my WEP Key and away I went on the internet.  Once I had checked my GMail, I decided that I wanted to write down some of my initial thoughts on the Eee, so I clicked on the "Work" tab and opened OpenOffice.  Typing on the small keyboard took some getting used to, but after 10 or 15 minutes I had the hang of it.  I can't bang out an email as quickly as I can on a full-sized keyboard, but the small keyboard is still very functional.  The biggest change to become accustomed to is the size of some of the keys (the right shift, tab and caps lock are not to the same scale as a full sized keyboard) and the placement of a key or two (the tilde is placed between the ESC and F1 key and the 1 key is placed directly above the Tab key).  These are minor differences in the overall scheme of things.

After I played with the stock unit for a while, I decided that I would then upgrade the RAM to 1GB. While this had little affect on the overall speed of the unit, I'd like to think that it ran more efficiently afterwards. :)

I spent the next couple of days playing with the unit with different operating systems that suited my needs, after I was done and satisfied with my tests it was time to test the worlds most popular operating system on this little laptop.  It was time to install Windows XP Pro onto the laptop and rather than do it in some fancy geek way, I decided that I would follow the instructions given by ASUS in the owners manual.

Now, I did nLite my legal copy of XP Pro to slipstream XP2 into the install CD and also strip all of the stuff out of XP that I knew I wouldn't be needing on this machine (foreign laguages, drivers, etc).  The only reason I did that was to conserve space on the 4GB SSD, even though a full install of XP Pro would fit onto the drive.  Once my modified copy was installed, the entire OS install with ASUS drivers and Firefox web browser occupied only 834MB of the SSD

NOTE that the install of Windows (or other Alternate OSes) needs to be done via an External CD/DVD Drive, as this notebook does not have an internal optical drive.

I followed ASUS' instructions on installing Windows and everything went off without a hitch.  The directions were simple enough that anyone with intermediate computer skills could have followed them.  ASUS even gives instructions on making Windows more efficient (by changing the virtual memory, compressing the drive to save space, relocating files and folders to another drive/partition). XP ran great on this little machine, better than I had initially expected.  While the default OS is perfect for this machine, I wanted to install XP because I figure that a majority of owners who purchase this laptop and have an extra copy of XP would eventually install it.


Performance:
This machine is great.  The default OS boots and is ready to use inside of 24 seconds.  XP boots and is ready to use inside of 35 seconds.  The OSes see and use SDHC cards as if they were a second drive, so storing documents and even installing programs directly to them works just fine.  

Wireless performance is very good, I was able to connect to my home network without any problems, and also able to connect to a local Hotspot and the WiFi at my local library.  Microsoft Office 2000 seems to load faster than the default OpenOffice, and both a very usable on the 800x480 screen.

Battery Life I was able to get about 2 hours 45 minutes of near constant surfing while in battery mode.  While that isn't GREAT, given the specifications of the machine, it was certainly decent.

Internet browsing on the 7" screen requires scrolling, horizontally and vertically.  I left the screen at the default 800x480 for the entire test.  This is the only drawback to using a 7" screen with a resolution of 800x480.  Some websites, such as Google and the Forums at RV.NET did NOT require horizontal (left and right) scrolling while others, such as the RV.NET homepage, did.

All in all, I think that this is an excellent addition to the ultra portable lineup.  What you get for the money (approximately $400US) is a fully functioning computer with a 7" LCD screen that weighs about 2 lbs. With 3 USB ports there is plenty of room for expandability, and using the VGA out to hook up to a computer monitor or HDTV is great.  You will not be playing games on this machine or editing video, but this machine offers great function without a hefty pricetag and all in a body about half the size of a conventional notebook.  Will this replace your home desktop or be your primary machine?  Probably not, but you will be able to browse the internet, check email, do office work, listen to music, share and edit photos, watch movies, do your taxes, and any other general basic computer function with this machine.

The following ratings are how it performs against manufacturers claims, not how it performs against full-sized notebooks:

Performance: 9/10
Screen: 8/10
Battery Life: 7/10
Cost Benefit: 8/10
Portability: 10/10

Overall: 8.4/10 Very Good

very good espresso maker. only used less than 10x.  im used to the industrial size espresso machines at work. the crema comes out pretty good if you make everything at the right consistency. the ground press is awful. go buy a separate one to press the coffee grounds. takes a while to heat up, but that's expected. you must clean everything up after which can take awhile.. i think this will be for weekend use only when i have the time to go through all the steps and clean up.

This wireless router, besides supporting Linux firmware, is a tested and true wireless router with 802.11 b and g support.  It supports WPA, WPA2 and the older WEP encryption schemes.  In addition, it has a built-in firewall, MAC address filtering, and supports access policies (such as "don't allow FTP connections to this computer on Sundays").

When I installed this wireless router, setup was very straightforward (I did not use the Setup Wizard because it didn't work for me).  I changed the IP address range (because the DSL modem uses the 192.168.1 address space), set the administrator password, chose a name for the Wireless network, enabled WPA2 encryption and picked a passphrase.  

After that, I connected my laptop to the router right away, and received an excellent signal and throughput of 100 KB/sec (for comparison, my DSL connection maintains a throughput of 300 KB/sec when I connect straight to the DSL modem).  

I've been using the router for several months now, and have not had any dropped connections (my older Netgear router dropped connections fairly frequently and did not support the newer WPA encryption scheme) and have consistent throughput.  The router has been running constantly for these past few months.  

For the real tech-heads, this router has customized Linux firmware available from third parties.  I haven't tried this firmware, since the base Linksys firmware more than meets my needs.

Finally, good security practices are to:  Change the administrator password, disable Universal Plug and Play, disable Remote administrative access, use a unique name for the access point, and if the network is only for a small number of personal devices (i.e. a laptop you own), enable MAC address filtering.  A MAC address uniquely identifies a network card, so this only allows certain computers to access the network.

I am new to the juicing world, so my review is for anyone who wants a basic impression of this machine.  The simple truth about this machine is that it is quiet (at its highest speed it reaches a loud hum, hardly what I would call "loud"), it is as durable as it could possibly be, it is powerful, it is well designed, it extracts a significant amount of juice (the pulp it extracts is lightly damp to dry but not wet/pulpy), and it is very fast.  The only thing this juicer does not do as well is juice leafy vegetables such as wheatgrass, lettuce, etc.  The juicer extracts some juice from the leaves but chops them up and puts large pieces in the pulp bin as well.  I don't believe this is a great criticism of this juicer, because from what I've read you are best with a masticating juicer (not a centrifugal juicer such as this) if you want to juice leafy vegetables.  That said, buy this juicer if you want a good vegetable/citrus/fruit juicer that will last for years.  I've juiced ginger, carrots, apples, grapefruit, and celery in it and had no problems with any of these.  The juicer did not clog with any of these items.  It's a great machine.  I am very satisfied with it.

This is the first video camera I've ever owned (I'm 58 yrs old), and I love it!  Video quality is excellent (even in low light). I have not tried viewing it on a large TV, but the playback looks great on a 19" monitor.  Best quality is observed at the "normal" size (about 8" diagonal) but the full screen version is perfectly acceptable.  Audio quality indoors is good up to about 8 feet from the subject.  Comments made by the person holding the camera while recording are extremely clear.
Battery life so far has been NO ISSUE.  A continuous 30 minute recording does not even move the battery charge indicator bar.  Beware of incredibly large files though!  A 30 minute recording will consume 900 Mb, and I've found no way to share files that large.  There must be a way to convert the files to DVD on the computer, but I'm not savvy enough to figure it out yet.  The included software says you can edit the files too, but the instructions have thus far eluded me.  I consider that to be a user problem, not a product issue. Just be prepared to dedicate a LOT of computer memory to file storage!
Another restriction is camera shake.  Mino is so small and light that it's nearly impossible to hold steady.  Pressing buttons to zoom or start/stop will almost certainly result in a shake, but most people will figure out how to clip the ends in editing.  I did buy the little tripod which eliminates the problem.
Despite the few difficulties, I do highly recommend this camera after 3 months use.

Exceptional computer for any size, fast, long battery life, ultra portable, excellent deal! I also love the fact it has XP and not Vista! It is easy to use and carry! I love it so much I bought two more Aspire ones for my kids to use. I do homeschooling and they are perfect for it! Also the cannon bjc85 ultra portable color printer truly makes this an office on the go. I recommend the merchant "printers to go" for printer purchases, he is awesome with exceptional customer service!

All reviews led me to this and am so pleased.  It has such a great weight, bowl turns easily and snugly into operating position.  The sound is about half as loud as a can opener!  Never startles me.  The Lexan bowls rinse off readily.  I have added three more blades and used a large French fry for a variety of omelet vegetables.  Worked well for all three.  Nice size after saute without wilting away. 
I use this several times a week cooking only for myself and simple dishes, mostly salads. I can even change blades without emptying the bowl.
I have all blades in a handy top drawer of my kitchen and this is one device that will never be put away.  Love it!

GTD (Getting Things Done) is the martial art of personal productivity management. It teaches you a systematic way to keep projects, tasks, wishes, and "stuff" managed in a universal list system, and off your mind. It leaves you free to devote your full attention to the present moment, knowing that everything you "should be" taking care of is tracked and WILL be taken care of in time. It allows you the flexibility to change your plans when necessary without losing track of your SHOULDS.

I've been using GTD for over 4 years now, and I keep rediscovering its beauty and applicability to new situations. Whenever I feel stressed, or find myself working at less than stellar productivity rates - I find that it's because I've neglected some aspect of the GTD system.

David Allen is an excellent communicator, and his system is bullet proof. If you would only experience the relaxation of a clear mind that GTD offers once, you will swear by this book like I do.

I gave one of these to my daughter when it was clear the Sony videocam I had given her earlier was not seeing any use.  Immediately the films of grand-daughter demonstrating her latest ballet moves started arriving via e-mail--good enough to motivate me to get my own Flip, even though (or especially because) I'd never used my Panasonic videocam. Like a Canon Elph, the Flip fits in a pocket, but it's less complicated and more user-friendly.  The image quality, moreover, is quite satisfying if your primary interest is in capturing some of those moments that are otherwise lost.  

The good: 1. The convenient the pull-out arm means no missing USB connector when you need it. 2. Good image and sound when camera is plugged into composite inputs on a TV set (admittedly lousy audio from the camera itself).  3. The company is so determined to make things easy, the camera comes with batteries installed. Such attention to user-friendliness characterizes everything about this camera and its save and edit program.  You can send low-res clips over e-mail, save hi-res clips to your computer, select snap-shots with a simple click and then drag them as Jpegs to iPhoto (I'm using a Mac).  Edit movies in iPhoto or use Flip's editing program, which is similar to that of Roxio Toast (permits trimming the beginning and end of a scene).  4. On a Macbook a 30-minute film opened on the desktop in 30 seconds.  Saving it to a higher resolution required 2 minutes. 5. The lens is capable of capturing viewable images even in near-dark conditions.

Things to be careful about: 1. The zoom lens button is so close to the start and stop trigger that it's quite easy to activate the unintended feature (compose your shot, then forget the zoom). 2. The lightness of the camera makes it very susceptible to camera shake. (Keep your shots short and resist the temptation to zoom in and out.) 3. There is no viewfinder and the camera's screen washes out when shooting outside in bright conditions.  4. The delete button is so accessible that a 2-year-old can lose all your footage with two clicks (it was poor judgment on my part to let her play with the camera). 5. Very few instructions come with the camera, but they're not needed. Flip dumbs it down to practically any point and shooter's level.

Which Flip? There are some demonstrations comparing this Flip with the newer model (Ultra Flip) on Youtube.  It soon becomes clear that there is no improvement in image quality when using the newer, more expensive model. And since I have little interest in editing and have an accessible laptop, I figured that 30 minutes would be all the time I would require from the camera.  If you choose your shots resourcefully, half an hour is enough to capture an entire wedding--from ceremony through reception.  Think like Hitchcock--keep the shots short in duration and make them count.

Who cares if it's a netbook or notebook.  It's freaking awesome!

The Intel Atom CPU is almost identical in performance to the Pentium M.  My 2.0GHz Pentium M is just slightly faster than the Atom 1.6GHz.

The little Atom CPU works well for gaming if you switch Power4Gears (overclocking software from ASUS) to Turbo Mode, the CPU jumps to 1.75GHz.  I tried overclocking it with a third party program but it kept turning off my network cards.  (i know, right?)

With Turbo Mode, my Vista Performance index is 3.3.  CPU: 3.3, RAM: 4.9, HDD: 5.4, AERO: 5.9, GAMES: 5.4

I have installed and played the following games on the N10J-A2:
Fallout 3, Gears of War (DX10), F.E.A.R., Tomb Raider: Anniversary, Unreal Tournament 2003, World of Goo, FakeNES, ZSNES, DooM 95.  I simply let the game decide what settings are best and the frame-rate stays high.

My favorite feature is the HDMI port.  One plug switches the computer to display 1080P 60Hz on my TV.  Switching takes about 5 seconds after plugging it in.  My last notebook required a VGA and minijack cable, yuck!

I play a lot of highly compressed DivX files with no stuttering.  DVDShrink takes about 30 minutes to deep analyze and 30 minutes to encode a full DVD.

Netflix Movie Player plays flawlessly even with the highest quality setting.

The keyboard and mousepad are both large and feel expensive, although the mouse buttons produce somewhat loud clicking compared to others.

The screen is gorgeous by the way.  Very good quality.  The 1024x600 resolution isn't a hassle with ASUS MultiFrame program.  It helps arrange the windows to maximize your square-pixelage.

I recommend fresh installing Vista (not the restore CD, but just a Vista disc) and turning off the page file.  

BIG HINT:  Also purchase a 4GB 150X SD Memory Card for ReadyBoost!  They're about $40 and will make a HUGE difference for the better.  Just pop it in, click "enable readyboost", and forget about it.  Everyone should have a readyboost drive on a vista machine.  

The bottom line concerning this computer:  This is a highly portable media machine.  It will play modern games, watch compressed videos, and encode DVDs far better than I predicted.  I thought the Atom CPU was a joke until I put it through the tests.  Some would consider it underpowered, but can your Eee PC play Gears of War in DirectX 10 at 20-30fps on a 57" LCD @ 1080P?  

Hope this helps!

This is a great series and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the vampire/human love angle. There were so many twists and open angles left for this series, I honestly wish it had been picked up for a second season.  The relationship between Beth and Mick had a great deal of promise and the eventual - "Turn me" question would have surfaced.   Would Beth have gotten to that point and would Mick have made her like him?  I also like the development of Joseph who, at first, came off pompous and yet was there to back Mick when needed.  He had a heart, as one episode showed, and that softened his character.  And what did eventually happen to Coraline? This series is much better than 'Twilight'.  But then, Ron Koslow was part of the production team.  He was also involved with 'Roar' and I believe 'Beauty and the Beast' (TV series), both which I also recommend.

Hi All,

First things first...I have recently started the Atkins diet, yet again, and thus wanted to get a scale that I had faith in.  We went to Target and bought a regular Taylor Digital scale...but I was a bit perturbed by the way that thing behaved.  I figured I would try Amazon and get a higher quality scale and give it a shot.  Here is my story.

I setup a physical with the DR yesterday evening, the 1st day I decided to start my change in food based lifestyle.  I knew the scale would be at home when I got there since I had it shipped via Amazon Prime 2nd day.  The DR did the usual and took my weight (without shoes, fully clothed).  I came home and without too much of an afterthought I set this scale up (it requires 4 AA batteries NOT INCLUDED).  I went ahead and weighed myself without shoes again and voila....the weight was almost identical to the DR's office.  I mean its hard on those DR scales to get a ACCURATE read-out...but I had a good idea and this scale was 99.9% dead on.  I then proceeded to try the Taylor (which we still have until it gets returned) and my weight was off by 2lbs....off on the lower side.  There was no way I lost 2lbs that quickly.  HAHA.  As a side note...I did place the scales at the same location when weighing myself so that there was no difference in floor/etc....

All that being said...  I dont really care about the BMI measurements, YET.  That will be something I get more into when my body starts to make changes.   However, here is the cool part, this scale will remember up to 6 users in its memory.  Basically you go through a simple setup and tell it about a users age, weight, height, and male/female.  While it may not allow day to day tracking of weight loss, it does keep track of your weight and BMI on a daily basis.  

The build quality of the SCALE is nice...it also looks great in stainless steel and looks like a professional unit.  If you are wondering..it is probably about 2 inches in height from the ground.  The LCD is large enough to see clearly and guides you through your weigh in.  When I say it guides you, I mean that when you turn it on and get to your user settings it blinks to 0 and then you simply watch the lcd display until it has done your weight and BMI.

One of the best features is that it turns it self off when you are done and you simply can hit the power button towards the front lip with your toe to tun it on.  You can also use your toes to press the buttons to get it into your USER settings so it can memorize/track your progress.

I think it is a great scale and would highly recommend it.  I hope my review gives you some helpful insight into the product.

I bought these Cliff Kids Twisted Fruit Ropes for my son.  He did not care for them, but I (his Mother) love them.  They should take the word  "kid" off the label and leave them as just Clif Twisted Fruit Ropes!  They are conveniently packaged so that I can put one or two in my purse for when I need a quick, nutritional snack while on the go!  They are about the size of a pen and just slip right in my purse.  I buy these for me now.....not my kid.  These taste great!!!!

You cannot beat 264 diapers for 35 bucks. I was worried about using Luvs on  my daughter, because they broke my son out because of the blue strip inside. But my son has many allergies, and breaks out all the time. My daughter hasn't broke out or had diaper rash since I've used the luvs. Before I was still using the pampers swaddlers the hospital gave me. She stayed red in those. I'm glad I decided to give them a try with my daughter. And I'm glad I'm only paying 35 bucks a month on diapers!

I'm a beginner with video, so I'm not one to judge the quality of the image. After reading other reviews, I thought it would be better than it is though. You have only the small LCD screen to use to make adjustments such as exposure or white balance or manual focus, and LCD screens are notorious for looking different at different angles. The screen swivels for ease of use, but where do you set it to know you are seeing what the camera is seeing? Once I put some video onto my computer, it was easier to view, but several shots taken of a marina on a cloudy day had vague purple stripes in the sky. The still images are awful, with lots of purple fringing. The stabilization is electronic and only applies to the video mode, so the camera portion is almost worthless. 

I took some video of some real estate to show my family, and the microphone picked up my footsteps in the grass much better than my voice. The windscreen hardly works at all. I shot some video at the beach and didn't even notice the breeze until I heard it on the video. (and despite what another review said, there is no audio gain control -- there is an audio level indicator but you can't control it)

A big surprise for me was the noise of the buttons. The microphone is up front, but the buttons on the LCD are right there too. There are only a few things you can change while recording (exposure, manual focus, mini-light, backlight compensation, zoom), but all the buttons make noise that is recorded and make it difficult to hold the camera steady.  Other features such as white balance, scene type, digital effects, and a few other settings must be chosen before recording starts.

I haven't tried the included software. I can easily copy the files to my computer by plugging the camera in with the USB cable. I tried putting the SD card into my built-in card reader, but half the time it worked and half the time it locked up my computer. I think that's probably a hardware issue and has nothing to do with the camera. But the first few videos I took were strange because sometimes playing them (in Windows Media Player) sometimes hung the program and sometimes they played fine.

If you shoot video at eye level, the standard grip that the camera is built for is OK. I have fairly average sized hands, but I have to put my hand at a tiring angle to keep the camera level. My boyfriend's larger hands have no problem with this (it fits better), but he has a hard time hitting the record button with his thumb - he has to use the middle of the thumb since it's so close. Trying to hold the camera any other way, it's difficult to keep it level and steady.

It's hard to get a drip coffee maker to brew at the right temperature, approximately 195 degrees Fahrenheit.   I have tried and tested several drip coffee makers and this one is the best I've found.  Although the Black & Decker doesn't meet the drip temperature specifications for making the best coffee it will begin at little over 170 degrees and toward the end of the brewing cycle it will reach 190 degrees.  Most others like the popular Mr. Coffees don't get much above 175.  I read the Bunn coffee makers brew drip coffees at the correct temperature but they only sale a 10 cup brewer or a pod machine and I think the water reservoir is always heated.  They are also a lot more expensive.  You can make improvements in brew temperature with this machine by filling the reservoir with hot water.  The coffee will then begin brewing a little over 180 and eventually get close to 195.  Caution: better not heat the water above 150 degrees before putting it in the reservoir or you will have a bubbling mess on your hands.

If you want drip coffee at the correct temperature it is probably best to heat your own water using one of the inexpensive (under $5) manual coffee filters.  This machine, although not perfect, is more convenient.  It is very cool how it automatically turns off and I really like the fact that it doesn't destroy the coffee with the usual drip coffee machine hot plate.

One other thing... I had a minor problem with the reservoir not emptying completely.  Jiggling the plug at the bottom of the reservoir fixed the problem.

This made for TV HBO mini-series is outstanding. Based on the book of the same title by David McCullough (watch the extra interviewing him), it is excellent history as well as character study. If Adams was the somewhat cranky but brilliant statesman he is said to be, Paul Giamatti plays it to perfection. Laura Linney is also brilliant as Abigail Adams, every bit the intellectual and emotional equal of John (the film does a great job of showing the important role she played). The more we see of the real history of our founding and its architects, the more amazing the story becomes. These were not perfect men or saints as sometimes is portrayed but flawed human beings with great ideas and the will to persevere and sacrifice personal interests in implementing them. There also was not the harmony and unity that is often implied. Our country was put together in the crucible of debate and compromise and hammering out some very different viewpoints as to what the country should look like. Adams and Jefferson (also portrayed very well by Stephen Dillane) were two opposites in philosophy and personality but who were able to work together (most of the time) for the good of the country (a novel idea for today's politicians). A great story about the founding of America. By the way, did you know BOTH Jefferson & Adams died on July 4, 2026, exactly 50 years after the Declaration of Independence. www.lusreviews.blogspot.com.

The Ultra Series Flip Video is perfect for recording up to one hour worth of video. It is perfect for families who want to share videos. I found that the sound quality is ok. The zoom is adequate but not great. And the picture quality is good for its price. The better the lighting you have, the better the quality of the video taken. It even looks good when watched on a TV screen. No sense lugging around a camcorder when you can carry this very light and small video camera that fits in your shirt pocket.

Downloading the videos to a computer is simple and it keeps with some pre-loaded software, which makes it easy for you to edit, email, save, and make photos from the videos. The editing is very basic; it lets you trim some off the front and back of what you recorded. And it is set up to link right into You Tube. I was able to make a video just seconds after installing the batteries.

The Ultra Series Flip Video has the ability to be mounted on a tripod as well as an action mount that can both be bought separately. But the 1-hour of video is all it can hold, which is more than enough for me. It does not have the ability to have the memory upgraded.

Just to summarize this video camera is very light and easy to use. It is so easy to use that no instruction manual is necessary and I am not electronic savvy. It comes with all you need, including TV connector cable, carrying case, wrist strap and even the batteries. This is all you need to share video with your family at a low cost.

I purchased this as a gift for my Father. First and foremost, it had to be easy to use and durable as my Dad has little patience for complex gadgets that don't work or break easily. So far so good. He uses it every day. Sets it in his pocket and tracks his calories all day. He was even impressed that is can automatically tell when you are running or walking and it adjusts calories burned. He set it up himself too. Normally, I have this task but was impressed he was able to do it in about 5 minutes. He still needs to hook up the USB connector to the computer, so I wonder if he would have been happy with the unit just a step below this one without the computer hookup. Oh well, I think it is money well spent so he stays encouraged to exercise more.

I persuaded my husband to go with me....it did not take much, anyway ... neither one of us could take our eyes off the screen... the chemistry ... facial expressions...slow motion...the extreme wanting... the burn.  It was us but on screen... minus the vampire flare of course. For us it was like looking in a mirror....and the twilight saga is amazing. I thought about the movie for days....weeks. I was completely taken by it.... it was not at all what I expected... it was so much better to the contrary. I hope they keep all of the actors for the following film... sequels. With the same actors, well it just makes it all the more astonishing....that may not be the word I am looking for but I'm sure some of you follow.

I LOVE this product. I live in a townhouse where putting up a traditional fence is against the rules. Invisible fence is my only option. I looked into having one installed but when I heard $1500.00, I nearly fell over. My back yard is only 40x40!!! ... how could it cost so much?!?!  I am a single mom and have no idea how to install an underground fence so when I heard of this product I couldn't imagine a better solution. (AND AFFORDABLE!!) Set up of this unit is as easy as plugging in a lamp. That's all you do.... plug it in! It took me all of 5 minutes to set the boundaries. It really is SO easy and anyone who says otherwise is... well I will keep that to myself. 

I have two dogs (150lb Great Dane & 50lb Shiba Inu mix) and both dogs learned their boundaries the very first day! Of course I would like to assume that my dogs are exceptionally smart but reading the other reviews, this is not uncommon.

I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone. Super easy and even better yet.... when I move I can take it with me! Try THAT with any other fence!

You know I was pretty surprised how well it worked. I pretty much took a leap of faith due to the fact that I am on a budget (trying to get ready for the fire academy, wish me luck!)

What comes with your purchase is a heart monitor strap that goes around your chest. You do feel it, but when your running and in the zone, it doesn't really bother you. A watch that teleports the heart rate from the heart monitor strap to the watch. You also get a rubber mound on which you can place your watch on an exercise machine, and a convenient pouch to store everything.

What I also like about it is that I can just put on just the chest strap, and it would transmit my heart rate onto a treadmill or an oplitical machine without the watch. 

Overall I am happy. I wanted to go with Polar, but you get all this for a fraction. And it really works. Overall, I would recommend this to my friends and other gym "rats".

First, my actual rating is 4.5, but seeing as you can't rate half-stars...yeah.

*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*

I, personally, am satisfied with the ending to Edward and Bella's story.  However, I regret greatly that it's over, and also that there was no battle scene.  I was anticipating an epic battle between the Volturi and the Cullens (+friends).  I was, rather sadistically, anticipating the deaths of some major characters.  I was prepared to cry; as a Harry Potter fan, I'm no stranger to deaths of characters that are well loved.  The main reason for the half-star deduction is that the ending is very unicorns-and-rainbows-esque.  Everyone is happy in every perfect way, everything plays out exactly (if not better) than Bella had hoped.

On the notion that Meyer is sending a negative message to teens everywhere, I say, IT'S A BOOK, PEOPLE.  The Twilight universe is imaginary, and if anyone were to say, "Hmm, I'm not going to college and I'm getting married at 18, and that's OK because a character in a book did", then I would say that they were destined to fail in life anyways if they would take such irrational direction from a thoroughly fictional book set in a thoroughly fictional universe.

Breaking Dawn is truly the epic conclusion that Twilighters everywhere have thirsted (ha ha) for (sans battle scene, of course...). I cannot say much more than that on the book as a whole. It captured me, reeled me in, and kept me reading for hours on end. I recommend it (and the rest of the series) to everyone, book-lover or not, Twilighter or not.

After purchasing a laptop for my son, I needed to get a wireless router for my home.  I put off getting on for fear that things would be "too difficult." 

Finally, I relented and purchased this modem.  Even before it arrived, I had planned on having to get my IT brother to do the installation.  Turns out, I didn't need him after all! 

Anyone can install this router!  Just follow the directions and it is up and running within minutes.  There is nothing hard to understand in any part of this at all.  If you know where you're modem cable is and can reach the back of your hard drive, you're ready to install it.  As simple as 1-2-3! 

I've had no down time since having it.  And I've found that it works all through the house and even into the yard, so there is definitely great reach on this product. 

When it comes time to upgrade, Linksys will be the ONLY way for me to go!

This ice cream maker is easy to use, takes up almost no space, and turns out bowl after bowl of creamy custard based ice creams, light fruit-filled ice creams, and fluffy sorbets all with a minimum of set up or effort.  The bowl goes into the freezer until it has frozen solid (I just leave mine in there all the time so it's frozen when I need it), and in two seconds the base is set up and I'm pouring in French Vanilla Bean ice cream, or champagne citrus sorbet, or fresh peach ice cream with peach chunks.  Sorbet is as easy as grinding up some frest fruit in the food processor or blender, mixing in a simple sugar syrup that takes 5 mins. to make with sugar and water, and optionally adding a little lemon juice or a teaspoon or two of alcohol to give it a softer consistency.  I like adding champagne -- it softens the texture but tastes great as well, giving it an added tanginess that helps keep the sorbet from being too sweet.  Clean-up is a breeze as there are only three parts to clean.  The freezer bowl, the plastic piece that sits inside it, and the top.

Seriously, I have not bought commercially made ice cream since I got this maker.  I just go to the market, see what looks freshest , and it's sorbet within a few hours.  Ice creams almost as easy and much better than Steve's, Baskin Robbins, etc.  I can't say enough about this little unit that looks like nothing.  It's sure something!  And at less than $50, it's a bargain.  I've bought them for all my friends.

I'm a Twilight newcomer.  I was initially hesitant to read the books because I figured that they were probably just trashy teen vampire novels like the ones I was into back in high school.  After several friends in their 30s insisted that I read the books, I picked them up...and couldn't put them down.  All four of these books are some of the most mesmerizing books I've ever read.  The Twilight Saga is one of those rare series that envelops you in the world that the author has created and haunts you for days after reading them.  Actually, I must admit that I've become embarrassingly obsessed with them.  My husband is beginning to suspect that I'm insane.  It's just impossible NOT to become obsessed with these books, though.  Meyer has a rare gift.  I'm quite jealous of it - I wish that I could create such a powerful world full of characters that seem so absolutely real, regardless of the improbability that such beings might exist.  

On to the book at hand.  I have to say that I am very disappointed about the negative feedback that this book has received.  When I began reading Breaking Dawn, my initial reaction early on was, "No...No...What's going on here?  I don't like the direction that this is headed."  Yet the further on I read, the more I realized that this book was the perfect resolution to the Twilight Saga.  After a second reading of the series, I was absolutely convinced that this was true.  Breaking Dawn pulls together all of the uncomfortable hanging threads that arose throughout the other three books and weaves them together into a perfect ending.  In fact, upon a second reading I realized that everything was heading this way from the very beginning, and that there was no other way that it could end.

Meyer's writing improves with each offering, so Breaking Dawn is definitely the most well-written of the saga.  The prose is excellent, and just like the others before it, the book sucked me in and immersed me in Bella's world.  This book is quite a roller coaster ride, so I went from feeling elated, to uncomfortable, to depressed, and so on.  The moods in this book are in a delicately balanced, constant flux, which Meyer handles excellently.

Bottom line:  Read this book.  Ignore the negative feedback.  This is how the saga should end.  The book is riveting and well-written.  It left me clamoring for more stories about the Cullen family.  I hope that Meyer chooses to continue writing about them.  I'm desperately curious about where the future takes them.

I paid for $450 three month ago, since I really need it for working in airplane for cross country flight (my Dell D630 is still too big and last only three hours with a $400 9-cell battery).

Same as some other customers i originally bought Tarantula and exchanged it for this one two days later. Tarantula might have more features but unless you are used to a laptop keyboard feel, Reclusa by far outbids it in comfort. The moment i hit a button on this beast i knew that im keeping it, words cant describe how soft and easy to press they are. Im a hard core gamer, I have tried every major gaming keyboard out there and besides the fact that Reclusa is a little shy on features it is still one of the best gaming keyboards in my point of view.

I just got this for Christmas, so I'm still getting used to it.  It is easy to use.  I like that it has a covered compartment for the different toothbrush heads.  There is a 'soft' speed, but I wish it was a little more gentle.  Overall, this is a great toothbrush.  It came with the flossing head and the polishing head and I also got a pack of the regular heads.  The flossing head was a little harsh, I was scared to use it on my front teeth, but the regular heads worked fine.  If you are planning on purchasing this particular toothbrush, I suggest picking up a pack of the 'Oral-B EB17 Flexisoft' heads as well.

My daughter and I keep our 'Eat This Not That' books in our cars.  It is a great reminder of what to order when needing to catch a meal on the run, and simply eating out in general.  There is interesting detail, and several alternatives to help choose what is best for you.  

There are a number of restaurants in this book which we do not have in our area, which made the book a little irritating to thumb through.  But now I've marked the pages of those that we have, and the issue is solved.  Not all the healthiest menu choices are intuitive -- some surprised me -- so I am glad to have the information this book provides.

I've given it 4 stars because I doubt it will save me 30 pounds or more.  But it does provide realistic, wiser choices for each time I eat out.

I ordered this camera before starting a 2 month vacation.  I got it about 5 days before leaving on the trip, so had very little time to get used to it.  Fortunately it is an easy to use camera.  I've been using it for nearly a month and still have plenty of memory left on the hard drive.  The only time I notice any shaking in the video is when I need to zoom in to the maximum.
I would recommend this to anyone looking for an easy to use, reasonably priced digital camcorder.

This product worked spectacularly well in my house with 6 cats in 2400 sq feet. With two males (neutered) and four females (not spaded) we have had constant problems over the past three years with cats spraying areas to establish territoriality.

We have 10 litter boxes scattered about with 3 or 4 different types of litter (more than the n+1 rule), but this hasn't eliminated the problem. I've tried isolating cats with their own litter box, and although this helps it also didn't solve the problem.

About three weeks ago we installed 6 diffusers throughout the house -- particularly in areas where the cats constantly soiled. The result was almost immediate. They stopped urinating outside of the litter boxes. In only one instance has a cat urinated, and that was in a room we normally have as a cat free zone.

The problems caused by having the second male cat hasn't disappeared. He is socially immature and tends to attack the other cats, but the stress levels for the cats have gone down.

I wish we had known about this product sooner. Other than its cost, which is a problem, Felliway does what it claims and I will be using it from now on and am an enthusiastic endorser.

I have been looking for a good bread machine every since my last one that I had had for about 10 years accidentally fell off the counter.

Although costing more than a standard modem this unit works as advertised. It offers a 2 way firewall watching both inbound and outbound packets. Most router firewalls are inbound only thus some setup is required for products like steam that need special outbound ports opened. A simple Google search for this modem and steam ports showed me how to fix the problem. The wireless is good not the best but has the latest encryption formats and I get signal thru the house. I have no connection issues to my laptop or playstation 3 using WPA encryption.  I have been using this modem combo for about 2 months with no issues except the firewall ports.  I do not see closed non standard ports as a problem as I appreciate the better firewall, verses my old router firewall/wireless that only blocked inbound ports. If you have cable buy this modem over renting.

This is a great combination of Cable modem and Wireless router. It takes up so little space compared to having them separately. If you're using comcast you will need to call up the customer executive to get its mac id added to your account. But installation takes only 10 mins and it runs smoothly. Also its software for changing preferences and firewall settings is one of the best I've seen. For a little more or just the same amount of cost as a wireless router and modem, you can buy it in one. 

100% recommended!!

Our dog is basically obedient, but sometimes "forgets" himself in the excitement of the moment.  This led to his being in the road and not returning when called one morning.  This collar was just the thing.  We only turn it on when he will be loose outside (always with us) and just the beep will break into his excitement and make him return immediately. Turning it off and on is easy and the little "clicker" goes into a pocket.

I bought the Slingbox Solo and Turbo, as my router is not close to my HDTV. The setup process took about 15 minutes, and the Sling Box works great. I use it to watch  recorded programs while travelling on my laptop, the quality is generally very good. One problem that the Sling Box has, if you connect your cable box to your HDTV using an HDMI cable, you will only get a video signal using the analog video cable, when connecting the SlingBox to your cable box. The composite cable connection will not work, so you will not get a HD connection.  I contacted technical support and Sling Box does not have a fix for this yet. I have a Scientific Atlantic Explorer 8300 HD cable box and a Samsung HDTV.

Currently 22 years old but more relevant than ever, this story is one of the greatest novels EVER created-it's one of those things to read before you die and ideally before the movie comes out next March!! [sidebar: go to the offical site-you'll find it, and watch the trailer if you haven't already: OMG. That's all I'm saying. Here's hoping the movie does justice to this amazing book.]
Personally, I wouldn't read it if I was under 17, it's a bit strong on the violence, it's brutal, gory, very dark-though not without humor, but there are no excesses here; everything including the few sex scenes and strong language serves only to move the story forward.
In short, this is a work of SHEER GENIUS.

Although I come to this as someone quite new to graphic novels-picking them up because of the Iron Man movie this year and the ever brilliant Heroes, you have to trust me on this and after the first 3 pages, you'll be glad you did!
Without giving anything away, (I didn't have a clue about this when I picked it up, I got interested because of a vibrant movie magazine cover) it's a superhero/save the world deal in it's most basic essence, intelligent, multi-layered and flashbacky.
Sometime in the late 1930s, regular joes, inspired by Superman comics and the like, decide to don costumes and fight the crime in their neighborhoods. For the most part, they don't actually have superpowers-except the blue guy, but the was due to an accident in the lab. Anyway, having a common goal, they come together.
In 1977, these vigilantes are outlawed so most of them retired and went into other ventures.
In 1985, the year the story is set in, it seems that someone is killing off these once masked heroes while Earth is fast approaching the brink of World War 3.
One still active, despite being a wanted man, is on the trail: What will he find? Will he live to tell the tale?? Will there be yet another war to end all wars???
Well now, there's only one way to find out-until March anyway, but come on, books are (99% of the time) always better!
From the first frame to the last and every single one in between, (provided we don't take Sally Jupiter's hair into consideration,) is FLAWLESS. And once the ride's finished, you'll want to go on it again.

There may be better crepe makers out there, but for the money this one can't be beat.  It took no time to figure out (well, okay, maybe 2 bad crepes) and it consistently makes excellent crepes.  I can make enough for breakfast for 2 in about 5 minutes (I make the batter the night ahead).  After breakfast, I use up and remaining batter and freeze the crepes for another day.  If you really get into it, you may want something fancier, but I suspect you'd still keep this one around for ease of use.

It's really a no-brainer.  If you need an easy to pack light-weight (2.2 pounds), compact travel computer this is the one.  It's fairly shock resistant with a solid state harddrive which doesn't have a moving part like standard harddrives so it won't be unuseable just because you drop it, or because someone else did like a baggage handler, or a child.  It can virtually be tossed around without scrambling the harddrive, while it's turned on.  The Linux Linpus operating system is simple and intuitive by design.  I think it's easier than using Windows but not quite as slick as Mac 10.4.  It's drawback is built-in storeage but it's so easy to carry a small external 250gb HHD it becomes a non-issue.  Plus with the Aspire One, sometimes referred to as "the One", AA1 or AAO,there are two SD flash memory slots to add a maximum of 32GB each and there are three USB slots to even add more flash memories or external HHDs as mentioned above.  The important features for me are that it e-mails well and I can use it for Skype, specifically Video Skype, especially convenient with the built Webcam and WIFI.  And, yes, you can eBay with it.  Those who are stuck in the conventionalities of Windows compatibilities such as MSN Messenger, Yahoo, and GoogleTalk, while it does work on the One you'd be better off getting the model with Windows XP for wideo chatting, though you'd have to get a standard harddrive.  One other point about the One is the keyboard.  As with all the netbooks if you have big hands and thick fingers you're going to have a bad time with it unless you get an external keyboard, but if you're more normal sized the Aspire One has the most user friendly of the netbooks.

THE MOVIE

I'm going to be keeping this spoiler-free, so don't be afraid to keep reading. I hate it when reviewers give away key plot details, it really hurts the movie experience. Speaking of which: you need to see this movie in IMAX if it all possible (they're doing a re-release in January 2009). It's worth the extra few bucks, trust me. Christopher Nolan shot at least 6 scenes in the movie using IMAX cameras, and it shows.

In case you've been living under a rock: this movie is a direct sequel to Batman Begins and is not at all related to the prior Batman films. The main premise is that the organized crime in Gotham, under siege from Batman, turn to The Joker for help and, naturally, chaos ensues. This movie is hands-down the best comic book movie ever made. It took my high expectations and just shattered them. This movie doesn't just blow away Iron Man, it really outshines Batman Begins in its dialogue, pacing, and action scenes. This is Batman the way it was meant to be experienced and really combines the elements that make Batman my favorite comic book/animated series.

There's so much to love about this movie that I'm not sure where I should start. I think I'll go with the acting: Heath Ledger steals the show as Joker among an already incredible cast. He doesn't just portray the Joker, but for 2 and a half hours he is the Joker. I can't think of the last time I saw an actor nail a role so well that I couldn't even believe it was them in the role. I'm not saying I thought he was a bad actor before, but just the voice and makeup and everything transforms him into a completely different person. He's so good that I'm sure Jack Nicholson will see it and say, "Wow, he was good!" If you go to this movie for no other reason it should be to see Ledger in his best role ever. It's so sad to know that he can't come back in a future Batman film or any film at all. If you ever doubted his abilities as an actor, this movie will embarrass you.

The rest of the cast doesn't disappoint either. Christian Bale is an even better Bruce Wayne than before and really takes on a darker, grittier Batman. This movie is really dark, and Bale doesn't shy away from this. Michael Caine IS, well, Alfred. He was in the first movie and he is here also; he defines what it means to be Alfred. If you've seen the first one (which you really should before walking into this one, but don't absolutely have to) then you know what to expect here. Maggie Gyllenhaal really steals Rachel Dawes from Katie Holmes because it will amaze you that Katie Holmes ever could have been Rachel Dawes. I always felt that Gyllenhaal was underrated and it shows in this film. Aaron Eckhart was the perfect man to play Harvey Dent. The concept of a DA with a passion for justice is not lost on Eckhart. He starts off as being not bad and then progressively just gets deeper and deeper into the role. Morgan Freeman's character is given more screen time in this one and while I would've loved to have seen his character fleshed out a little more I appreciate their time restrictions also.

Speaking of which: the worst thing you can drudge up about this movie is how dense it is. It's 2 and a half hours long and a lot happens, but I feel like it's paced well enough so that you'll always want to know what happens next and you can't possibly be bored. You probably will laugh, cry, and jump in your seat (or squirm) during this movie, it's just that powerful. I love the dark humor because I love dark humor in general, and the delivery is always impeccable. The dialogue in this movie is decidedly more mature when compared to its predecessor, which I think is saying a lot (probably because David Goyer was not a part of writing this one, just in conceiving it). Getting back to my point though: there are several plots throughout this movie that do all tie together but can get confusing if you don't pay attention. Of course, I just look at this as giving more re-watch value to the film. There's so many little details to appreciate and the cinematography is so spot-on that you can't help but want to watch certain scenes again and again. The special effects are never too heavy and are always just welcome inclusions.

This movie should not be seen by small children. Seriously, if you're under 14 then you have no business seeing this movie. It's not curse words or violence (though there's not much cursing and there's absolutely no nudity), but rather the themes that this movie revolves around. They're dark, complicated, and involve a lot of moral gray area. Besides, the Joker would probably seriously creep out anyone that young (I'd be surprise if he didn't give some adults bad dreams). The haunting imagery in this movie will likely stick with you, but you have to appreciate the fact that these characters are likely to stick with you. You really care about them and feel involved in their lives.

I give this movie an A+ with my highest recommendation for you to run out and see it right now. Please, go see it in IMAX if you can, and Blu-ray if you can't. If you are above the age of 16 and you do not see this movie then something is wrong with you. Yes, it's that good.

THE BLU-RAY SET

Does it look every bit as good on Blu-ray as it did on the big screen? For the most part, yes. I think that when you watch a movie with as dark as palette as this one the scenes with a lot of black don't look as good as you may remember on the big screen. The IMAX scenes are pretty much breathtaking. I was a little disappointed with how they enforced the IMAX aspect ratio: the IMAX shots will take up your whole screen whereas the rest of the movie will have black bars at the top and bottom. Since my other Blu-ray movies don't do that, it makes me feel a little cheated. Still, they're fairly thin bars and the quality is pretty amazing for the rest of the movie also. The only flaws you're really going to find in the other scenes in the movie are just noise in the backgrounds occasionally, but you pretty much have to walk right up to your TV (which I hope is HD if you buy this on Blu-ray) to notice this noise. The edges are razor sharp all around and I can't recall seeing any artifacts. I think it doesn't look as good as Wall-E simply because the colors in the movie itself aren't as vivid, but they're definitely crystal clear and ensure that you won't miss a single detail in a single frame. So don't buy too much into what some critics are saying, I still think it's worth your money video quality-wise (I can't speak for the DVD version though because I haven't seen it). The sound is even better though. Even on my simulated surround sound, it never comes close to disappointing. It gives you that true movie theater experience with explosions you can almost smell and gunfire that's almost too realistic. The score shines pretty well also.

Now for the weakest part of this set, if you can even call it that: the extras. I didn't try out the digital copy, but I did try out BD Live and perused the other extras on both discs. The BD Live content is nothing particularly exciting. You can create and watch video commentary, which I think is kind of a gimmicky. You can also do live chats. The other main feature is the ability to watch movie trailers and other video content that should've been on the disc but wasn't because it wasn't good enough. There were a couple of videos that I was kind of peeved didn't make it on the Blu-ray because they were actually interesting, but the others were animated shorts that added audio to frames of a comic book that was created for the movies. I only watched a couple, and they were terrible. The artwork was just fine, but the dialogue did not sound like Batman at all (I mean the writing, not the voice acting). What's worse about this stuff is that the video size is only a quarter of your screen, are lacking in quality, and buffer terribly. It's best to start playing one, pause it immediately, and then go make yourself hot cocoa while it buffers the video so that you can actually watch it continuously. My cable Internet isn't the bad, but I can stream videos just fine on my laptop. I would've liked to have seen a trivia game or something else on BD Live.

The other features are pretty good though. There's no commentary track, which I didn't mind because I rarely listen to those, but you can trigger featurettes at various parts of the movie when you see the appropriate icon, or watch them all entirely outside of the movie. There's about 90 minutes worth of that stuff, and they're pretty fascinating overall. I had never seen an IMAX camera before watching the featurette on it, and it's incredible to imagine how they filmed any action on that thing. On disc 2 you'll find a couple of documentaries that no one has seemed to point out originally aired on the History Channel in the weeks leading up to the release of The Dark Knight: Batman Tech and Batman Unmasked. So when you read reviewers talk about how strange it was that neither of these documentaries include non-trailer scenes from The Dark Knight and only scenes from Batman Begins, you can be a smarty pants and correct them. I thought that they were pretty well-done and great ways to lend another level of realism to this character and world on top of what the movie has to blot out the abominations of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. I especially liked the Unmasked one, a psychological analysis of Batman, because part of what I always liked about him was how dark and gritty and real he would always feel and that he was even thrown into Arkham himself once. There are also some episodes of a Gotham news program that were movie cheesy, but still useful addition in that they help ground the film in what feels like reality. They're almost like deleted scenes, in a way. The other features you have is a smattering of photographs and concept art, and all the trailers and TV spots, which I always love to have to watch long after a movie was released and I'm always bothered when DVDs don't include them. The concept art is pretty awesome, and I really wish that had taken the initiative to let you view them picture-in-picture with the film as an optional layer.

Overall, this is definitely something worth buying. Even though it's not a monstrous amalgamation of special features, it's a pretty healthy amount that will take even longer than the movie itself to go through, and the quality of everything (besides the BD Live content) was excellent.

ADDENDUM: LIVE CHAT EVENT

I participated in the live chat event with director Christopher Nolan on December 18 and it was awesome! It was text only, not video. At first I was disappointed, but actually text chat lets you enjoy the movie fully and only tune in to what Nolan is saying when/if you want. It's actually a text box at the top of the screen that's readable without being too big and has a somewhat transparent background so that you can see whatever part of the movie it covers. You ask questions on the WB BD Live site (you had to be logged in, so only people in the chat could ask questions), and Nolan (or perhaps a third-party) goes through and asks as many of the best as quickly as possibly. 

Sometimes, he picked ones that I thought were kind of dumb or already answered in other features on the disc, but there were a lot of insightful questions answered about the casting, nuances of the story, origins and inspirations, etc. I didn't get any of mine answered, unfortunately, but the event could only support 100,000 people and with 600,000 copies sold on the first day alone (I imagine a significant number from pre-orders), I imagine a number of people were excited about this event a week afterwards.

I don't know how often they're going to be doing this, but it was cool. It was the only BD Live feature that I thought was creative and on par with some of the stuff Disney is trying out. I'd love to see them do more live events with actors from the film or even Batman comic experts.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)

      



I picked up this router for two reasons: (1) I wanted to upgrade from my Wireless-G to Wireless-N (draft), to make file transfers faster between my computers; (2) I wanted to give whichever router I liked less to my parents, so I could have wifi there when I visit them. My existing router was a Linksys WRT54GS, which had good wireless-G speeds (I couldn't complain) and excellent uptime, stability, and reliability. It's main drawback is that the firmware doesn't have some features I want, such as the ability to set stable IP addresses to my PCs, and it can't be flashed to Tomato or DD-WRT. When I received the router, I decided to replace it, without using the Windows-based setup wizard (networking equipment shouldn't requires Windows), and set it up in the manner of an advanced router user. 

First Impressions/Hardware Impressions
This router looks very nice. The lines are clean (there is no external antenna). The plastic is shiny. The lights on the front are stylish. The only thing I didn't like was that the manual said that the unit MUST be used in the vertical position, due to concerns about operating temperature (and probably the internal antenna, too). This is fine and all, but I liked the ability of the Linksys and other routers I've owned to be wall-mounted or positioned horizontally. The router is set up thoughtfully, and I like the on/off switch; I've never seen one on a router before, and I don't intend to use it, but it's nice to be able to turn off a piece of electronic equipment for a change! The packaging was spartan, sensible, and minimal, which I liked.

Initial Setup
The router comes with a CD with a Windows-based setup wizard. As a Mac and Linux user, this made me a bit nervous. Netgear seems to understand this, and helpfully point you toward the help files on the CD-ROM, which in turn point you toward "manual" setup instructions. The instructions were clear, concise, and had clear illustrations. They are minimal, however. They don't outline the capabilities of the router's firmware, which I was very curious about.

Firmware
As far as my Internet research told me, open-source, third-party firmware such as DD-WRT is not compatible with this router. I would love to run alternate firmware on my old Linksys router, but the version I have (version 5 of WRT54GS) doesn't support it. Fortunately for me, this router's firmware has a lot more functionality. Using the manual setup instructions, I found I could connect to the router using the address [...] instead of its IP address, which I thought was a nice touch. (Routers like this one have a web interface, which lets you adjust all available settings from one of your PCs.) The firmware presents you with a three-pane interface. The right-hand pane is context-sensitive help for each function. The contextual help is pretty useful, actually, for intermediate-to-advanced users. Most home users wouldn't look at it, I don't think. Anyway, the first time you connect to the router, it automatically checks for firmware update--a good feature. The best feature of this router, to an advanced user with a home network set up, is IP address reversation: You can force the router to give the same IP address to each of your computers, every time they connect. This is great for home servers, and is so easy to set up on this router, as compared to setting up static IPs on each computer. The router also has Quality of Service (QoS) features, which allow you to shape how much bandwidth is used for internet, voice, instant messaging, video games, and so on. Personally, I don't use this, but I would have loved it back when I was a VoIP customer. There are, of course, many features that I consider standard, such as DHCP and port forwarding. All in all, I was impressed with the stock firmware and don't feel a need to replace it.

Speed
Large (1 GB+) file transfers between my wired Linux server and my wireless-N MacBook are faster than with my old wireless-G router. I'm happy. I can't compare it to other wireless-N routers, though. As for Internet speed, it certainly seems snappy, though it could just be my imagination. I am not sure if it is any faster than my wireless-G router was; if anything, my cable modem is slower than this router can handle, so I didn't expect much change.

What I Didn't Test
I'm an advanced user, and don't mind setting up the wireless network and security myself, through the firmware. Therefore, I didn't test the WiFi Protected Setup feature. I didn't test the wireless range because I have a rather small apartment and it isn't an issue I'm concerned with. I didn't get Quality of Service because I tend to use the Internet for only one thing at a time. I've only had it for a short time, so I cannot comment on stability or robustness.

Remember To
If you buy this router, remember to set a new password for it, set up Wifi security, and change the SSID (the network name) so you can easily identify it!

Verdict
I really like this router's firmware features, and think that I will hold onto it, and pass my Wireless-G router on to my parents. I'm a little concerned about the stability issues that other reviewers mentioned, so I'm going to dock the router one star for now, and revise my review (if I'm allowed to) in several months or so.

My cats love the Petmate fountain!  I purchased the fountain elsewhere and actually paid $30 for it.  I think it's a bargain even at the price I paid!  Assembly was simple.  As long as you don't let the tank run out of water it is almost completely silent.  Refilling and cleaning are simple.  I've found replacement filters to be inexpensive and easy to find.  Basically, I'm as thrilled as my felines!

My cats love to drink from the "waterfall" - and sometimes love to splash around in it, too.  The fountain big enough for both of them to drink at once, so the less aggressive cat doesn't get shoved aside so the bully can have a sip.    

There is only one thing I would change in my fountain - I would have purchased one with a larger capacity.  Living in Hawaii, I think the water evaporates quickly because I have to refill the tank every day.  Since it's easy to refill that really isn't much of a problem, but I will keep it in mind if this one ever conks out on me...

Tropic Thunder takes an absurd, behind the scenes look at a blockbuster Hollywood production while satirizing the war film genre. From tongue in cheek jabs at great war flicks like Platoon and Apocolypse Now, to prima donna actors, to Tinsel Town power brokers (Tom Cruise's best performance of late), nothing is sacred. Stiller's humor is over the top and razor sharp, Jack Black does what he does best, fart jokes and physical comedy, and Robert Downey Jr. is nothing short of amazing. 

The special features include the standard behind the scenes featurettes and deleted/extended scenes, but hidden among them are two gems. Rain of Madness does for "Making of" documentaries what Tropic Thunder does for Hollywood blockbusters.  Also included is the sketch from the 2008 MTV music awards showing Stiller, Downey, and Black trying to come up with a viral marketing video. The clip had me laughing as much or more than the feature did.

If you are into satire and silliness, Tropic Thunder is a solid fun movie.

I got into the CH hardware after my trusty TM F-22/TQS/RCS set up got to the point where it was too old and battered to be able to keep working correctly.  I started with the Fighterstick and the Pro Throttle and within a week had placed my order for the pedals.  So far they have worked well and withstood the effects of damp shoes, cats, dust, and so on.  I have used them in Aces High 2 and the previous incarnation of Microsoft's Flight Sim and when combined with the CH yoke these pedals have also acted as racing controls in GTA2 and I have been extremely happy with them.  I only gave the pedals 4 stars because, to me, they are a bit too narrow.  Given that the pedals were designed to fill double duty as both a flight controller and as a driving accessory this is understandible and probably would not be a problem for anyone who had not started out on Thrustmaster's RCS.  Another small problem has been that the left toe brake consistently has a stronger 'grab' than the right despite numerous calibrations but this is a managable problem.  Overall these pedals are an excellent addition to any sim-pilot's flight control suite and well worth the purchase.

I would probably give this 5 stars had I not seen this film so many times that its charm has worn a bit thin.  This is an excellent film for the entire family.  The jokes are clean, though mostly geared toward adults, but there is more than enough swashbuckling action and basic humor to entertain the kiddies.  For those with kids, it's a good DVD to invest in, particularly if you're tired of watching The Land Before Time Part 28 and would like to enjoy the same movies your kids do.

This is a nice product. It was easy to install (just connect to a USB port) and has enough memory for most simple applications. Have not figured out the inscription files yet, but so far, have not had a need to. The long strap is interesting, it certainly will be hard to lose this flash drive with it. Overall, nicely designed, although the rubber tip could get lost if you don't keep track of it.

First, Quicken Mac is an excellent basic financial tool (I'd hate to be without it).

However, after reading Intuit's press release for Quicken Mac 2007 and then using the program, I have to wonder what Intuit has been doing all year ... especially the Mac programmer(s). The Mac version's feature set (especially new features & bug fixes) seems woefully inadequate when compared to the Windows version.

[...]

(1) New! Easily download and track your 401(k) portfolio
Um, couldn't we do that before (except maybe the "easily" part)? The biggest problem I've seen is that many financial firms refuse to support Mac downloads. Banks, etc. have told me that Intuit wants to charge them separately for Mac support, and they refuse to pay.

(2) New! More detailed paycheck tracking
Wow!

(3) New! QuickEntry Widget
How long does it take to write a widget. An hour? A day? Note to Intuit: most widgets are given away free. After all, the technology is now built into Mac OS X.

(4) New! Know precisely what your balances and holdings are
I hate to pick on Intuit, but does this imply that previous versions of Quicken only allowed "imprecise" balances & holdings?

So, in summary, each of these "New!" features is priced at the bargain-basement price of $15 ($59.99 upgrade price), and took an average of three months to produce. And all this at the same price as the Windows version!

Also, I wonder if Intuit spent much time in fixing the bugs still evident in Quicken 2006? After all, Quicken is one of the few programs that still crashes on my machine (besides MicroSoft products, that is) [and luckily, the autosave feature works]. Also, did Intuit make any attempt at all to improve the Home Inventory program that has been limping along since 2004 or 2005?

Actually, we Mac users are pretty lucky, I guess. Just imagine how bad things could get if Steve Jobs' buddy Bill Campbell (Chairman of intuit) wasn't on Apple's board of Directors.

Purchased this a few months ago.  Used to have the portable battery operated water-Pik.  Battery started wearing down and wasn't getting good power.  Then, I lost the power cord and couldn't use it anymore.  

Like this one much better than I thought I would.  Not as big as it looks.  Sits nicely on my bathroom vanity.  It's AC powered, so I also get a good stong water stream.  Comes with several cool attachments, though I find that I never use them.  Water tank is big enough so that I can gat my whole mouth done with one tank.  (Portable one I used to have had to be filled up several times)

Only downside is that I can't take it into the shower like I could witht he portable device.  I've gotten the hang of it, so not much water spillage, but it can still be a little messy sometimes.

Teeth and gums are definately healthier.  I recommend it!

HBO's special miniseries and projects have been the gold standard in quality television productions in the last decade.  They have delivered many popular portrayals of American history, such as the notable mid-90s TV movie with Gary Sinise as Harry Truman, and the recent FDR bio "Warm Springs".  The former work made use of David McCullough's excellent biography, and now comes "John Adams", following McCullough's book the same.  The result is a quality production overall, though it is a bit slow in places.

Adams was a major player in the American Revolution, and his contribution is deservedly celebrated here, though his life presents some challenges to filmmakers; in particular, he was not really a presence in the field (so no big battle scenes or such moments of martial heroics), so the main drag comes after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, when Adams is shuffled off to the Continent to impotently lobby for aid from Europe.

The basic outline of the story begins in Boston in 1774, when lawyer John Adams is recruited by the British to defend the soldiers under arrest for the famous Boston Massacre, when protestors were gunned down.  The question is whether their captain gave the order to fire.  This first episode plays out like a legal drama; in episode two, the scene shifts to Philadelphia, and we get a new rendition of the familiar scenes of the Declaration being argued-over and drafted, and meet figures such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.  Episode three, the weakest of the seven in my opinion, sees Adams in Frnace, doing little of consequence and bemoaning his separation from his beloved wife Abigail.  Adams his little talent for diplomacy or the foreign French court, and he often finds himself getting in the way of the more skilled Franklin.  Upon his return to the United States in the final episodes, he must deal with the maddeningly inconsequential role of the Vice President, the rivalry between Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, his troubled presidency (with the focus being on the prospect of war with France), family squabbles (most of all his drunken failure of son, Charles), and, finally, his physical decline in retirement.

The title role is essayed by Pail Giamatti, who is a rather interesting choice for the main character in a 19th century drama; he is not the sort of heroic type one might expect.  This is suited to the Adams of the story, who is, for all his positive qualities, frequently petty and short-sighted, given to bursts of anger.  His wife Abigail is played by Laura Linney, who sometimes skirts too close to being a stereotypical Supportive Wife, but other times is accorded more in the way of emotion and personality variance (and Linney is a great actress).  Other performances of note are Stephen Dillane as Jefferson and a drole Tom Wilson as Benjamin Franklin.

Given that the story pans from 1774 to 1826, the actors require extensive use of age makeup, and the stuff used here is very good.  Giamatti, in particular, spends the last few episodes as an extremely believable elderly Adams.  Being HBO, the series makes a point of giving as 'realistic' a setting as possible, rather than the spotless look of movies like "1776".  Bad teeth abound as Adams grows older.  The series begins and ends with two especially memorable moments of period gruesomeness: the first, a grisly tarring-and-feathering of a British loyalist, the second a wince-inducing depiction of a 19th century mastectomy.

There is a rather bizarre scene where Adams rants about historical inaccuracies in the depiction of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, which seems out of place, given that this miniseries takes liberties with history as the average production does (right down the Adams' rant itself, ironically, which he did not give).  It's hard to know what to make of that moment.

Regardless, this is overall a very interesting piece of work.

After being a happy owner of linksys router for several years, I order this router and one g card the day it's available. I got it to work within 10 minutes using all the defaults and the quick installation guides on my VAIO running XP. Well prior experience sure helps here in getting the router configured via the web interface.It takes another couple hours to get my self familar with the technology, i.e., RTFM. Here are a couple things you definitely need to do to lock it down unless you want to be an ISP for your neighbors :)(1) First it is wide open using the default. Change the SSID to something else other than linksys and turn off the broadcasting of SSID.(2) Enable 128 bit WEP fast.(3) Lock down the mac address so only your g (or b...) cards can talk to the router.(4) While at it, you may as well change the channel.Other than these, I am very happy with it.Have fun surfing....

If you're worried about SIDS (loose blankets in the crib), or whether or not your little one is warm at night...look no more...HALO SleepSack Wearable Cotton or Fleece is the way to go!!!!  I love them, and know that my little guy is warm during those chilly nights.

Some spoiler info included, read this review at your own risk:

So I was finally able to finish it.  The verdict is in... and I personally really really LIKED it.  Not saying that it was my favorite.  I'm not sure at this point which is my favorite, BUT I liked this book.  I liked the fact that it didn't follow the exact same format as the other books.  I liked the fact that other than the fact that everyone predicted Bella and Edward would get married and that Bella would become a vampire, nobody predicted they were going to have a baby.  In turn nobody predicted that Jacob was going to imprint on said baby (this really is PERFECT if you really think about it).  I LOVED the unpredictability of the book in general.  I loved that there was a section from Jacob's point of view.  I'm not at all upset that Edward didn't get a point of view in this book because Edward is already getting a whole book from his point of view with Midnight Sun.  Pretty much the only thing that I didn't like in the book in all honesty was the name that she chose from the baby.  Seriously?  Renesmee?  Thank goodness she was able to shorten that down to Nessie.  Poor kid.  LOL

Yeah... maybe some parts seemed a bit rushed.  But as a whole, I think she did a good job at finishing out the story from Bella's perspective.  I'm happy that we got to experience Bella as a vampire and how absolutely opposite she was from her human self.  I also liked the fact that she basically had her cake and got to eat it too in the fact that she didn't have to leave Charlie behind.  There was a whole lot more pros than cons in this book for me.  So much so that I'm willing to overlook the few things that might have bugged me.  =)

Overall I give it an A+.

This review is from: High School Musical 3: Senior Year (Deluxe Extended Edition + Digital Copy + DVD and BD Live) [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)

      



I have loved disney films since I was about four years old and I still do. They're cheesy, but they're always entertaining. I think Highschool Musical 3 is a really well made film with great music, some good acting, and it's just a good time for the whole family. Some of the actors in the film aren't that great, they're way too cheesy for me to find them believable, but Ashley Tisdale is actually pretty decent at being the snobby diva and Zach Efron is actually a good stage performer. Other than that, most of the cast is slightly forgettable. Good movie and good musical. I have a weak spot for musicals and disney, so this one gets the better side of me. ps it looks great on blu ray, I'm glad this is how I saw it for the first time, however, i think ima skip out on 1 and 2...I've never seen them but...they must be alot cheesier than the 3rd one. Ok maybe I will rent. :)

Having been raised on Japanese food my whole life I am a stickler when it comes to good quality white rice that is cooked to perfection.  I can always tell the difference between good rice and cheap rice and whether or not its been cooked properly.  Also since I've gotten older, I've grown to love brown rice.  My old el-cheapo rice cooker would almost always under cook my white rice, and brown rice would make a huge mess all over the counter.  

I have been lusting over one of these fuzzy logic cookers for a long time.  I finally took the plunge and bought one last week.  I love this little high-tech appliance!  

A few tips to those who want to experience amazing Japanese style white rice:
1. Buy this or a similar "fuzzy logic" rice cooker.  You can't go wrong with Zojirushi, they are a very reputable and well known brand in Japan.  
2. When it comes to rice, buy the good stuff at your Asian market.  You can tell by the price of a bag. The good stuff usually costs almost twice as much as the cheaper rice.  Tamaki Gold ([...]) is a good one.  
3.  The quality of the water you cook the rice in is very important.  I use tap water to rinse my rice, then cook it in filtered or bottled water, it makes a huge difference.
4.  Follow the directions that come with your rice cooker.  Be sure to measure the rice and water amounts correctly.
Enjoy!

Looks great on the counter (I bought the red one), easy to use, quick clean up.  You can whip up a batch of ice cream in less than half an hour with just whipping cream, half and half, sugar and vanilla.  Throw in some cookies, fruit, or candy for an extra treat.  Great value!

Note:  this appliance comes with a recipe book so no need to go out an buy one right away.  Use the real vanilla.  The imitation has an ingredient that will keep the ice cream from freezing.

Nose hair is one of those side effects of aging that no one seems willing to talk about, even though everyone notices it. Co-workers, bosses, clients and friends will tell you their secrets for dealing with almost every other matter, but not this one. Well, I've had it. I have ear and nose hair and I'm not going to take it anymore. 

This thing just might be the solution. So far, it seems like it's got a good chance.

I received the Platinum XL at the same time as the Groom Mate Silver Wing Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, and I must admit my disappointment with the Silver Wing (not very effective; comprised of metal blades and silver-painted plastic handles; looks like it's got a lifespan of a year or two, if I don't drop it in the sink first). But, the Platinum XL more than made up for it. 

Once you hold this thing in your hand, you realize it could well be the last time you're ever going to buy a nose-hair trimmer, and, well, that's a shopping experience I can do without. It's metal, not plastic, with an adjustable tension screw and the most basic (yet ingenious) moving parts. 

My only concern is how rust resistant it will prove to be, but only time will tell. So far, I'm very pleased. I expect that with proper care to keep it dry, there's no reason it shouldn't last me until I'm too old to see, or care about, the shrubbery sprouting out my ears.

I'll start by saying that I'm 31yo, female, married with kids :)  I've always been fond of teenager drama; something I never really outgrew.  I've found this show's storylines interesting and entertaining, enjoying both the stories of the teenagers and their parents.  

The show's greatest perk imo is in the costuming.  Each character in each scene is wearing an eye catching, or in some way riveting outfit, including the men.  Accessories are used beautifully.  The actors themselves of course provide their own eye candy.  

A WORD OF CAUTION TO PARENTS however.  In the seven episodes I've watched so far there has been a great deal of alcohol imbibing by the teenagers, including a 14yo.  It is implied that one of the teenagers habitually uses a drug, pot if I remember correctly, which is discussed as trivial in light of a parent's cocaine use.  One of the teenager characters is occasionally seen sleeping with women paid by his father.  

From the first episode it is clear that almost all of the teenage characters are sexually active or plotting to be.  In the seventh episode, a parent gives advice on ambience for his son's planned night of virginity loss in his bedroom on a night the rest of the family will all be out of the house.  

Bottom line - A lovely guilty pleasure for adults who enjoy the genre but off limits to minors whose parents are hoping to instill morals in their children and teenagers.

This is a terrific little pedometer with many merits.  The most important is that one can simply slip it in a pocket where it functions brilliantly.  I have lost every other pedometer I have ever owned because, without fail, they eventually slipped off my belt during a hike. This one is also extremely accurate and has many features which I needn't repeat here.  And when it came time to change the battery, I realized I had forgotten how to reset it and didn't have the manual.  I went to Omron's website, downloaded the manual, and reset it all in about a five minute span of time.  This is definitely the pedometer to buy!

THIS GROOMING TOOL WAS THE BEST I'VE USED at first...but at 5 TIMES THE COST OF ANY TOOL I'VE PURCHASED BEFORE. SO IT IS DISAPPOINTING TO FIND THAT IT IS NOT WORKING AS WELL AFTER ONLY 20 FIVE MINUTE GROOMINGS. IT STILL WORKS, BUT NOT AS WELL. WITH REPLACEMENT COMB/BLADES RUNNING ABOUT 30 DOLLARS FOR THIS SIZE, I'M GOING BACK TO MY "SLICKER" GROOMING TOOL FOR ABOUT 10 DOLLARS AFTER THIS TOOL FAILS... AT LEAST UNTIL THE REPLACEMENT COMB/BLADES ARE LESS EXPENSIVE.I WILL USE THIS FURMINATOR A WHILE LONGER BUT IT JUST ISN'T AS EFFECTIVE AS WHEN NEW. 
update: well, i estimate grooming my lab with the furminator will cost about 60 dollars per year because the blade/comb must be replaced to remain as effective ...a well-made 10 dollar slicker works about 90 percent as well and last several years!

My baby was rolling over and getting his arms and legs stuck between the slats of his crib, but I didn't want to use a standard fabric bumper because of the SIDS dangers. The mesh allows air movement, but keeps his limbs inside the crib. I also really like that when he starts pulling up he won't be able to step on the bumper because it's so flexible. He was just over 4 months old when I got this, and now he is just over 6 months and I haven't had any problems with it. I highly recommend this product, with one caveat: The set includes one length of fabric for the front rails and then one much longer length for the other 3 sides of the crib. This allows for people with adjustable front rails to use the product. I don't have one of these, so there are two small spaces that aren't covered by the bumpers in the front corners. This hasn't posed any problem at all (and my baby is very active), but it should still be included somewhere in the product information.

I'd have to admit that the author is getting better.

I remember my Junior High Literature teacher telling us "You'll know you love a book when you loose track of time and try to finish it in a single sitting".  This was my experience with the book.  The author has improved in keeping the pace building into a crescendo that you wouldn't want to stop until you get to the denoma.

Instead of following-up on the author's hanging plot from her previous installment of the saga (NEW MOON), she had unexpectedly continued a plot element she has planted on the 1st book (TWILIGHT) and developed it.  This development has given the book a whole new different ethos and flavor as new characters in this installment are different "entities" from the previous books.

The author has also TRIED to give her other existing characters (aside from Bella, Edward and Jacob) their own identities, but her attempts were a bit flitting and most of the time feel cramped. At least though, the author has given time to make us realize the other people in the novel are "alive" and not just flower vases present for decorative purposes.

The author, just like in the first two books, is evidently still prone to putting her messages across too blatantly (like her view on pre-marital sex in this installment),  Her moral innuendos were close to becoming preachy, which is very brave on her part as the series is meant for young adults.

In general, the book is a great read and provides a significant insight for today's pop culture.

But as I said in my review on TWILIGHT ...

If you are not fond of Harry Potter, Anne Rice and Sweet Valley High ... this book wouldn't be for you ....

This is a very comprehensive pedometer.  It notes things that I hadn't even thought of.  The fact that it can be carried in a pocket or purse enhances the product, helping you to stick to your goals.  I would recommend it for anyone who is serious about their health.

I finally took advantage of getting what I pay for with my cable company. Prior to Season 3 of Dexter, I watched the first two seasons on DVD (Season One & Season Two). I used to send all this money to my cable company for subscribing to Showtime, and Dexter was never part of my regular TV viewing until 2008. Color me stupid. What was I missing out on?...Only the absolute best show on TV.

How good is it? Let's put it this way...I'm actually glad that I hadn't seen this until DVD, because my wife and I were able to watch the first two seasons in weeks versus like 3 months PER regular season on Showtime. We often watched three episodes in one night on the DVD sets. Alas, I couldn't wait for Season 3's release on DVD, so it was one episode of Dexter, one week at a time for Season 3. 

So certainly one of the good things about Dexter on DVD is that you don't need to wait 12 weeks to see a season from start to finish. But certainly the best thing about the series is how well done it is. 

Dexter (played by Michael C. Hall of HBO's Six Feet Under fame) is a blood spatter analyst with Miami Homicide. It's his job to help solve murders, and he also happens to moonlight as a serial killer....Just a side note that last part. 

The acting in the show is terrific, and the thrills and twists are plentiful. Combine the nature of Dexter's professional life with his favorite pass-time, and you can bet your carotid artery that there's plenty of blood in the show too. But rest assured that the show isn't just about killing. Relationships, family, the inner working of a homicide squad...all of this "stuff" is also packed neatly into the Dexter series and makes the show one of the best on TV that I've seen in a long long time. 

The major plot involving guest star Jimmy Smits in Season 3 is a bit more of a stretch of reality than were Season's 1 & 2. But the acting, dialogue and well-written story flow kept the show right up there at the top of my list of TV's finest.

Add this bloody-good show to your cart. I'd strongly urge newcomers to start from Season 1. I dare you to just try watching Season 1 and then not go for Seasons 2 and 3; I simply don't believe that anyone could possibly do that.

This is a worthwhile film that has all the elements needed to keep men & women interested in the outcome. It does not fail to entertain while also teaching that apart from having a self-sacrificing spouse, most marriages will fail once they hit the rough-sledding that comes after the first few months of romantic love wear thin. The acting is exceptional given all but the star (Kirk Cameron) are amateurs. The script & production rival  Hollywood.

Breaking Dawn is a GREAT book.   This book has a good mix of suspense and romance.  I had anticipated a different ending, but was pleasantly surprised with how the author chose to end the book.

We received an Oster egg cooker as a wedding gift many years ago and used it frequently, especially for poached eggs. When the Teflon wore out, we were unable to find this product on the market. We tried other egg cookers/poachers which were adequate, but we always wanted another Oster. When we found that amazon.com was offering this product, we ordered it. I boils up to 8 eggs and poaches up to 4 eggs. This is a wonderful little appliance that is easy to operate and is easy to clean.

I just wanted to say, I read the other user reviews and so I was concerned about the possibility of overflows, or cheap plastic that doesn't fit together, but I decided that for 30 dollars (total), I might as well give it a shot.

Well, not only am I pleasently surprised by how easy this product is to use, I also do not see how other users could be getting errors unless they are totally using the coffee maker incorrectly.

It's not at all difficult, just make sure that the filter is placed properly (there is a notch that fits the cup - it's not rocket science), don't overfll the water container, and don't put too much coffee grinds in.  The manufacturer recommends 2.5 tbsps, which is what I used.  I could see how with that amount, the grounds sort of ride up the side of the filter container.  If you put a lot more than that (say 4 tbps) you would probably end up overflowing the grounds when the water goes through.

Other than that, it is a cheap plastic coffee maker.  I wouldn't expect it to last forever!  But everything is in working order, and I'm happy with what I got.

WOW!!!    One of the BEST purchases EVER!    I went shopping for a mixer to make Holiday cookies and just could not bring myself to spend near $300 for the KitchenAid even though I have always dreamt of owning a KitchenAid mixer and brought home an Oster hand held instead which could not quite do the job.        THEN......I found that Amazon had the Artisan for the low low price of $199.99 with FREE shipping!     I immediately purchased it.   It arrived to me in just 2 days!  It got put to work making cookies within minutes of it's arrival!     I made LOADS of cookies for days with ease!     Wonderful!    Thanks Amazon for helping make my dream come true!!!   And my Family and Friends thank you for all the yummy cookies I made!

This is actually the second one I now own - not because the first one was defective in any way, but because the first one is great.  The first one, my husband and I received as a wedding present.  We have had that one over 2 yrs now, and it is still working great, after constant use.  Nothing has yet to break, unlike my many of my previous coffee makers, and it is very easy to clean - the main parts (the decanter, coffee holder basket) pop right out.  To clean the whole system, you just make a pot of white vinegar (not really, but you get the point), which is brainless and cheap!  No expensive cleaning solutions or anything.  And the decanter is virtually indestructible - we have dropped it on virtually every floor in our house.

This new one is now at my office where it also gets a lot of use - multiple pots a day which are drank by both myself and my co-workers.

As other people have commented, the coffee stays hot for hours (it even stayed fairly warm overnight once), and the coffee maker is really easy to use.  And you can stop the "making" process mid-drip process, which is also nice, especially at 7am.  And the timer is also nice (as long as you remember to set it)...  The coffee also comes out with out that burnt flavor and even after it sit in the decanter for hours, it doesn't taste burnt, because it isn't sitting on a heater.

First, a couple of disclaimers:
1.  This is the first pump-driven espresso machine that we have owned.

2.  We generally drink cafe Americano, which is an espresso with a little added hot water (or cold water with an iced Americano).  We make an occasional cappuccino and have thus used the steam wand, but not extensively.

After doing a cost/benefit analysis in regards to our current cafe Americano habit (~10 per week), we realized that there would be some justification to buying a home unit.  We first considered the Breville ESP8XL Cafe Roma Stainless Espresso Maker, but reviewers consistently lamented the unit's tendency to clog the filter, necessitating time-consuming cleaning.  Also, not being completely sure that we would actually use the espresso maker, we balked at the $250 price tag.

We also considered moving up to one of the superautomatico machines that grind, tamp, brew and dispose of the grinds, but we worried about the reliability of technology that had only recently hit the consumer-grade appliances.  After reading zillions of reviews, we realized that every mid-priced machine had some glaring flaw and, in the end, we decided to buy an inexpensive pump-driven unit and wait for the technology to catch  up before investing a huge chunk of change in an espresso machine.  Moving our investigation to low-end espresso makers, we were impressed by the reviews of the DeLonghi EC155 and purchased it from Amazon.

I put off writing a review in order to make sure that the DeLonghi was going to last until we had at least broken even on it.  We received it in mid-July and since then it has produced about 200 double shots flawlessly.  By my reckoning, that's about $400 worth of Americanos at the local cafe.  Even considering the price of the coffee, we have more than broken even.  So, here's our pros and cons:

PROs
- Price--we paid $91.28.
- Crema Production--this unit consistently produces a thick layer of delicious crema.
- Powerful Stream Wand--Easily froths milk.
- Mechanicals--After six months of nearly daily use this mighty-mite works as well as it did the day it arrived.
- Easy Cleanup--Filter cleans easily.
  
CONs
- Ergonomics--As other reviewers have noted, there could be a little more room between the area where the cup sits and the output nozzle.  Also the steam wand could be longer.
- Features--No cup warmer.  Not a big deal to us, especially considering the price of the EC155, but it will put off some buyers.
 
SOME THINGS WE HAVE LEARNED
- Using a coffee especially made for espresso, such as Lavazza, produces a much better espresso.  Lavazza has the added benefit of allowing you to go for hours without blinking.
- Preheating the unit for 15 minutes and warming the cups in the microwave improves the results and experience.

I know a lot of Fans did not like this book as much as the first three, but I was ok with it. I loved how Bella finally got what she wanted. Edward after 100 yrs he got his love and a family... I loved that Jacob found someone and still could be best friends with Bella. I have no problem with happy endings. I think a lot of fans thought Bella and Edward both needed to suffer more.. I am not for sure why.. I am just glad they can have their happy ever after.... I just hope she writes more about vampires... I know she says the Bella and Edward story is done, but there are more ppl in the last book she could write about.

At least its outer housing is mostly metal, not plastic. It's thinner but has a little larger footprint than the other drives. I was told by the Seagate tech guys that this is simply a laptop hard drive in a housing for external use, which I would assume is a cut above what's usually sold as this type device. I've personally autopsied, (after both's premature failures) a Western Digital and a SimpleTech external drive and was rather shocked at just how poorly constructed and sealed they seemed to be.
I haven't dissasembled this drive since it is still functioning perfectly, but it seems somewhat quiter and faster than the others. Of course, only time will really tell whether or not it really holds up to everyday use. So far, so good!

David Allen is a genius!  A few months ago, I was looking for a way to get organized and motivated about &quot;getting things done&quot; on a more timely basis.  I am so glad that I ran into this book at the book store!Mr. Allen puts forth a very simple, down-to-earth approach to accomplishing more in less time and with less stress.  I am absolutely hooked on his approach to organization and daily productivity.  I read this book through twice because it was so helpful and full of great advice that I wanted to make sure I adapted and changed my thinking fully.The basic plan is to get everything out of your mind and into your organizational system where it belongs.  Once you have your system set up with the proper &quot;buckets&quot; to hold all the items you need to deal with (and some that you don't need to deal with,...yet), you can clear your mind of the stress and worry that goes along with thinking about them subconsciously every waking moment.Throughout your day, you knock out any actionable items and place the unfinished ones in the appropriate &quot;bucket&quot;, depending on their status and the context of how they will need to be processed later.  Once these items are in place, you can forget about them until the next moment you have time to process more items.The weekly review is a major part of this entire system.  Mr. Allen covers each step with great detail and provides outstanding tips and advice on how to adapt it to work best for you.I recommend this book to absolutely ANYONE who would like a new and fresh way of thinking about productivity and how to best accomplish it stress free.  His ideas are easily adaptable too.  I changed some of the methods to fit what works best for me.  Overall, this book is excellent.

When I bought this cheese maker I had never made yogurt or cheese before, in fact the family never ate yogurt, I was worried this would be a one shot deal.  I heard yogurt was hard to make...but it was easy!  I tried several ways to make it. My favorite is with sugar free vanilla syrup, you know the kind we put in our coffee. I also bought a yogurt maker...but I never used it...it dosn't make enough now that we all eat yogurt and this great cheese. I make about 3or 4 qts.of yogurt at a time in my oven. 
Temp can't go over 120` or under 90`. I fix it before bed and let it bake overnight in 12oz.canning jars, you don't have to put the lids on, just use foil to cover. These are great to take to work for lunch.! Now that I have this cheese maker we don't use mayo or sour cream. Just cheese! I have this cheese maker going 24/ 7 in my fridge. Yes, I'm going to get another one! Nancy in Oregon.

I found the black version of this product by chance at a Duty Free Shop in Sao Paulo, listed at 750 USD, before a trip to the US. Once there, we weren't able to find it at any brick&mortar shop (BestBuy, now defunct CircuitCity, etc.) in the greater Miami area but many of Amazon's shops did carry it.
My 11-year old daughter wanted a digital camera but I had been procrastinating... This one seemed sturdy enough, being waterproof (has been in a pool more often than I initially imagined) and impact resistant (well, I don't know of anything, but it would be safe to assume that it did happen). 
So far, very satisfying. The only thing I would like to see improved in the future is resolution for still photography (VGA at 640 x 480) and maybe the zoom, but not that it is really needed because 10x is really good). 
Ah, one point of attention is battery life. It will go for about one hour before it dies. Replacemente batteries go for 35USD and are a good thing to have around.

This was an accidental purchase. I thought that it was much smaller when I originally purchased it. But when I received it, the company was willing to accept it back immediately upon notification of my mistake. I did wind up keeping it and is very easy to use and self explanatory. The external seems to be holding up well even in a severely dusty environment. All that you have to do is blow it off daily. It seems to have more room than I will ever need.

I think it's safe to say many were disappointed in CBS when they decided to cancel the series after what seemed to be a successful first season.  It left the fans and I think those involved with the show saying 'WTF?' (I personally haven't watched CBS since)... 

Thankfully they released the one season to DVD and for those that loved the show, they'll buy the season.  I will say it doesn't seem they put much effort into giving the fans what they were clamoring for - very simple packaging and I'm not seeing much on the 'extras' front so that's a bit disappointing... But I'm just incredibly thankful those of us that miss this show have something to remember it by...

(PS with the success of True Blood and Twilight, I wonder if the network is wishing they hadn't canceled!! They should bring it back - so much could've been done with this show)

I just wanted to start out by saying i second the guy that said that this thing loses a lot of its value when its outside of wifi range, and for some reason it doesn't do a good job in picking up wifi as many other handheld devices that have purchaced. I am in North Dakota at the moment so this is a tad bit of a problem, but if i were back in Cleveland or another big city then im sure id be in wifi range where ever i went. 

I would suggest listening to your music or watching a movie till you got back in wifi range because this device is amazing, from the apps store (where there are a number of apps downloadable for free) to the breath taking mobile web browser. The main downside of that though is that you can't watch flash videos. They did an amazing job with the keyboard and this thing holds a charge like nothing ive seen of this type. 

But i have to admit if the archos 5 had just a bit more polish i probably would have went with the 120g version of that. But i am VERY happy about my purchase.

Word of advice, this thing looks beautiful, but that quickly changes as it smudges very easily and its also very noticeable. GET A CASE YOU WILL NEED IT!

I actually bought this book for my sister (it was on her Wish List) but after she unwrapped it we both became fascinated by the information contained therein. Some of the items listed in the "bad choices" truly surprised me. 

Now, I hasten to add that you still have to read the book carefully. Just because a choice is "better" doesn't mean it's not loaded with calories. Sometimes it's 29 grams of fat vs. 35. So, just pay attention :)

The other thing I really think is helpful is that there are sections about supermarket choices and holiday eating.

And my sister likes it because it's an easy size to keep with you in the car, so that you can have the book handy wherever you end up.

This product does exactly what it's supposed to do - monitor your heart rate during exercise. The chest strap is fairly comfortable and doesn't move around. Put a few drops of water on it before strapping it on. 

My only complaint is that the alarm is not quite loud enough to hear when I'm listening to music. You can spend a lot more on a heart rate monitor, but I'm guessing that the expensive models don't work any better.

I purchased the Oster egg cooker as a gift for our son and his family, and they are happy with it.  We have had the same egg cooker in our home for 40 years, and it still works well after that many years of use.  It is small, compact, easy to use and reliable.  Before I purchased this new one for our son, I looked at egg cookers in stores, and I decided to purchase one like we have - based on size, appearance, ease of use, number of eggs cooked at one time and price.  This is one of my favorite kitchen appliances.

My husband and I are not coffee snobs but pretty close to it.  We love this machine!  We drink coffee all day long and it's so nice to be able to brew a fresh cup every time.  I also love the variety we can drink without having to make a whole pot and I can switch to decaf in the afternoon no problem.  I do however wish the k-cups weren't so expensive but we did order the pod holster to lower the expense.

Works well.  Crushes ice and makes drinks pretty well.  It's better to push the toggle switch down which causes it to run at a lower speed.  The liquid keeps moving and the ice crushes just fine.  With the switch pushed up and the blender on, the blade spins at higher speeds which sometimes causes a thick drink to have an airpocket to form above the blade so nothing moves.  Not the end of the world but causes one to either stir the slurry or jiggle the blender.

I bought this for my wife last fall.  Unfortunately, one of the buttons on the front didn't work.  When I went to return/replace, it was out of stock.  We waited, and eventually, they did get more.  Despite our 1st experience, we ordered another, and it seems to be fine.  Build quality is kind of cheap, but not out of line with the price.  My wife grew up baking bread, and is very pleased with the results she gets from this machine.  I would certainly recommend.

I love this straightening iron.  My own hair is straight as an arrow, but for personal reasons, I've taken to wearing wigs quite often and the hair is not always as easy to manage as my own.  Often, it's knotty or gets frizzy at the slight touch of humidity.  That's where the CHI comes in.  Within a couple minutes, the CHI is heated up and ready to go and I can quickly re-style my wigs or my own hair and have it beautiful and salon-finished at the drop of a hat.  

I was expecting some sort of a knob to put the iron at different heat settings, but there was only an on/off switch.  Nevertheless, the CHI has never gotten too hot to burn my hair (a big consideration, since I paid about $1000 for my wigs) yet has always gotten hot enough to get the straightening results I needed.  I also use it to curl the hair slightly at the ends and have now done away with my curling iron as well!  So happy for this product!

I received this as a wedding gift and like it a lot. Although it is super easy to use, it is not really a practical gadget for regular use. The canister requires a chunk of freezer space and must be frozen a day in advance. The appliance itself has a small footprint and a nice cord keeper underneath. Would be a good purchase for those who like different ice cream flavors, dieters, or those with special diet requirements (like no sugar). I usually make mango ice cream in it. In addition to ice-cream, it is fun for parties to make slushy fruity drinks. In  that case you will want to get an extra canister.

After reading many of the reviews before actually reading the book, I approached the book with great trepidation - how could such an amazing series be ruined with a disappointing ending that would leave some fans with the desire to burn their books?! I wanted to have faith in the author to deliver a storyline that was thorough, engaging, and as completely satisfying as the other books. I was not disappointed. For those reviewers who are complaining that the story wasn't realistic and that it shouldn't have tied everything up so neatly, what were you expecting when a series is about a love story that involves vampires and werewolves?! Yes, it got a little too sci-fi and gross for my liking when describing the unusual pregnancy and imprinting, but you have to admit, it was definitely a plot twist most readers would not anticipate and the author made it work! I was glued to the book for 9 straight hours because I was so absorbed in the story!

Stop treating Stephenie Meyer like some fundamentalist who is supposed to deliver this ground-breaking message! She is a gifted author who has been able to create incredibly captivating works of fiction and while the story is complicated, I believe that it is true to her original vision. Hopefully most readers can recognize that she is not encouraging 18 year olds to get married and have babies; she is very careful to promote "good" morals like loyalty, love, personal responsibility, and self-control. All along, she has described Bella as being different from others and noted how it would not be healthy for a normal person to lose themselves so completely in another person as Bella does with Edward. If her age had not been mentioned, I would not have considered Bella's actions to be unusual because you do notice significant maturity in her as the book progresses. The reason why this story is so attractive is because most, if not all of us yearn for the kind of love that Bella and Edward have - where you love someone enough to do anything to protect them and make them happy. 

So for those Twilight fans who are now wondering if you should read the book after the frenzy of scathing reviews it has received, I definitely recommend it. Just recognize that this is the conclusion of Stephenie Meyers' enchanting fairytale and all's well that ends well.

I was worried this would hurt my stub nosed pugs, but it almost sounds like screaming when I walk them and they see another dog.  
They still bark at other dogs a little bit, but these collars have reduced that a TON.  The citronella scent does not stay for long, and it does not hurt them at all.  I have noticed when the collars come out, the barking stops, even when getting them ready for their walk which is GREAT.  They are not 100 percent quiet, but at least I am not dragging them away from other dogs profusely apologizing anymore, and that is enough for me!

All is true, the spout wide enough to take small whole apples, it raced through everyhting I tried to juice, carrots, celery, cucumber, cabbage apples, and more. It is true the clean up is minimal I washed the parts and used the brush provided to clean the wire mesh sieve.The jug that is provided catches the juice and partially skims the froth, then pour and drink. I even made extra , which can be stored in the freezer without denigrating the vitamins in the juice. Fantastic. Totally recommend this model.

This is the best and clearest book I have read regarding the principles on which this country was founded.  Our founding fathers were nothing short of genious.  This book was both inspiring in that it reaffirms my belief in how important it is to defend the constitution, that less government is always better and that this country was truly blessed by God.  It was also a little scary to realize how far we have strayed in such a short time. The founders clearly understood the issue of religious freedom and the need to keep a particular religion from ever becoming a part of our goverment, but they would never have supported the idea of God being removed from schools or public places.  They truly believed we were doomed to fail without God.  I have passed this book on to my childs teacher and would recommend it to anyone who wants to really understand what our founding fathers intended for this nation.  It's required reading for my children as well.

I got this coffeemaker and I just love it! It is a solid, sleek piece of machinery. I have had a few coffemakers in the past, and a corningware perculator as well, but this one is the best by far, no joke.  It makes a full bodied cup of coffe, with no bitter aftertaste whatsoever, even when you make a small pot of coffee. It is easy to clean and I just love that it looks like what would be in a professional-type kitchen! The great superb tasting coffee just makes it that much better!! I also can't believe the coffee aroma this leaves during and after you make the coffee- so inviting!! I have had no problems with this, and if I did, it has a 3 year warranty which is unheard of compared to most companies!! Sum it all up, this makes awesome tasting hot coffee, stainless steal is so complimentary to any kitchen, tons of features, great warranty, etc.  I also reccomend the cuisinart convection toaster oven. It is as fantastic as this coffeemaker!!

I cannot say or add much that hasn't already been added.
However the very poor reviews are rather disturbing.
Not because it's an opposing opinion to mine, but because these opinions seem to have about as much thought behind them as what ultimately is symbolized as the central theme of this film.
A society that has lost the ability to actually think & is totally absorbed in consumerism, a lack of insight, & essentially have become just ID's, seeking pleasure without any effort..
Kids are bored by a film of this depth because they are bombarded with nonsensical, & consumer garbage 24/7, while Mom & dad do whatever, or work 2 jobs.
Truly jaded are they & devoid of depth.. A sad situation indeed.
So I will go on to say, if you're attention span is that of a spoiled, A.D.D child, then this film will not be for you.
However if you actually appreciate art, & would like to see an entirely new spin on a very familiar theme, then this is a must.

This is my all time favorite Disney movie, I loved this movie so much I used to watch it all the time when I was little.

What I like about this movie is that it has a good pace, it tells a long story in a short amount of time, by skipping out on things that probably would have made more sense, but would have slowed the movie down.
One might think "What does Eric and Ariel see in each other? They just fall in love and live happily ever after?"
I can imagine of utterly boring this movie would have been, having you forced to see those characters explain and show how much they love each other.
Instead, it's love at first sight, you kind of guess Eric's personality (though it's obvious he's kind and brave), and it dosen't slow the movie down, and they do add the romantic scene "Kiss the girl" to really show Eric and Ariels love for each other. "Kiss the girl" is so beautifully animated, it's one of my favorite scenes in the movie. 

The music and the songs really stands out in this movie, I used to sing-a-long with "Under the sea" when I watched it, nowadays I always choose "Part of your world" when I sing. That song is so dreamy, so perfect and tells the story that just because you got a lot of fancy stuff dosen't mean you are happy. "Kiss the girl" is also a very good song, it suits perfectly with the beautiful scene.

And to not make this a sappy love-story (like Pocahontas), there is some scary stuff in this movie. The ending battle is without a doubt the best painted parts of the movie, I can't even imagine how many hours was spent drawing that scene!

It's a good story, great songs, loveable (and not lovable Ursula) characters and beautiful animation.

For those of you that don't own any dvd's of this series this set gives real value.
The original mini series on disc 1 sets the scene for the program.(No need to buy the dvd as a seperate item)
As a watcher of sci-fi from the 70's I was a little apprehensive about this remake because I loved the original.
However I have to say that this has taken the original idea improved it & bought the special effects bang up to date.
One of the problems with the original series was the repeated use of the same airborne fight scenes. This series has excellent special effects, the actors are top class & the story lines very good.
In summary it takes the original idea & makes it into a proper grown up sci-fi series. SO BUY IT !!

I have been using my Waterpik for 1 month now. Very good price at Amazon. I'm a first time user and have been wanting to try it for a few years and has been recommended by my Dentist. . I went with the Ultra. I read where some people have trouble with water spraying all over the place, well they just don't know how to use it. With a little practice there is not a problem. I use the Gum fitting, and it works great as far as I'm concerned. The particles of food come flowing out with ease. My only problem is my Bathroom sink, I have no place to set the Waterpik down on a flat area, so I have to hold it on one spot of sink with one hand as I use the other to use the pik. Works for me and have no other choice at this time. Next month is my Dentist appointment and I'm curious to see if they notice a differents. So, you can say I'm VERY happy with my Waterpik Ultra.

I love Office 2007, a reaction that exists in sharp contrast to how I feel about Office 2004 (See my review on the Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac Student and Teacher [OLD VERSION] page).  Though I am occasionally stymied by trying to complete a task that yes, would've taken me seconds in Office 2003 or 2004 (both of which I have used extensively during my time at college), I find the ribbon interface to be fresh, bold take on something that had become quite old and stale.

From a functionality and usability point of view, the completely redone "insert symbol" and "insert equation" functions in Word '07 make so much sense and are so easy to use that it really frustrates me if I end up working on somebody else's computer that only has Office '03: the process by which you build up your equations is much more streamlined than ever before, something that I appreciate as an engineering student.  Additionally, the tools for manipulating images in PowerPoint (cropping, resizing, et cetera) are much improved.

Office 2007 is my favorite of the five versions of Office that I've used (X, 2003, 2004, 2007, and 2008)--I've got an install of Windows XP in Parallels on my Mac so that I don't have to use Office '08 to do my work.

While I think the actual production of DHSAB is fabulous and contains all the wonderful bits of good comedy and tragedy along with the bon mots and sweetness that is Joss Whedon and everyone alive should watch and enjoy this production, I have to knock a few points on the DVD.
There are no subtitles for the Commentary! musical which makes it impossible to understand some parts with no lips to watch, let alone deaf peeps.  You can't flip to a single ELE application and the menu flipping is a bit sticky (a common Joss Whedon DVD issue).  The Commentary! won't give you much new material if you know all the stories already (and will be funnier if you do), but is still worth a few hearty laughs.

This review is from: High School Musical 3: Senior Year (Extended Edition) (DVD)

      



Packed with jump out of your seat and dance music, the High School Musical series is something I think everyone could enjoy. I saw the third film before seeing the earlier two and I think it is the best one of them all! My favorite scenes include "A Night to Remember" and "The Boys are Back" but every scene with the Wildcats draws you in.

If you like feel good music that is insanely catchy and watching extremely cute and talented actors on screen (Zac Efron and Corbin Bleu) then I think you would really enjoy HSM3: Senior Year. 

Like Hugh Jackman said at the Oscars last week, "The Musical is Back!" And I for one could not be happier!!

This player is great for the price.  I didn't have any problem uploading music(mp3) to the player using Windows explorer. The radio tuner works very well and haven't tried the recorder yet.
Minor problems are that the battery runs out quickly if you have it higher volume, even on mid level volume, it'll drain the battery within an hour and power saver mode reacts within 20 seconds if you leave the player paused. Otherwise, great player.

Who knew a guy could get so excited over a cat box?  Not me, 'cause I'm not a cat guy by any means.  So I guess this is the cat box for tentative cat masters.  I've had cats in the past, and I DREAD cleaning their boxes.  But this one makes it so simple.

Here's how it works:

The cat does his/her stuff in the litter box on the left.  On the righthand side of that is a big vertical screen.  Above that is a bin and a high slanted roof.  When you're ready to clean it out, you tip/roll it on its right side.  All the not-gross litter flows through the screen into a secure area.  Then the not-not-gross stuff rolls across the roof and then falls into the bin when you put it back upright.  Then you pull the bin out by the handle and empty it out.  Rock it back a little to the left to make the not-not-not-gross litter tip back into the dumpatorium and your kitty is back in business.

There's very little litter loss with each cleaning, so there's no hesitation to clean out the box every day.  It couldn't be more simple and less disgusting.

If you have a cat, buy one!

If you don't have a cat, then get a cat and then buy one.

This is the second year I've used TurboTax and I love the product.  It pulled in my info from last year and it took less than an hour to input everything.  I was done with Federal and State returns, filed online, and had my refunds in about 3 weeks.  Will probably buy just federal next year because my state return is easy enough to do myself with the info from my federal and I can file online for free in Illinois.  But TurboTax makes doing my taxes so easy it's fun.  I wait anxiously for it to arrive and then spend a geekily happy hour or so doing my taxes.  Anything that can make doing taxes fun, I'll keep buying.

After our trip to The Netherlands last year, we were hooked on the Senseo. The taste, the convenience, and the ease of use makes this an perfect fit for coffee lovers that just want to brew a cup or two during the day. The only downfall is the cost of the pods. It was shocking to see how much the pods cost here in the US. In Europe, were these things are a common thing in every household, you can buy 60+ pod bags for less then 3 Euro. I don't have to tell you that we are stuffing our suitcases everytime we come back from abroad... 
The Senseo machine itself is excellent quality. Can the water container fit a little better... yes... but it does nothing negative to the function of the Coffeemaker. Actually, if the container is more the half full, it fits pretty snug. We love the LCD on top and use the Senseo not only to make our daily coffee, but also our nightly tea. Just change out the pod holder with the special tea one. It states on the box that it should come with it but ourrs was missing. One quick phone call to Phillips and a week late we recieved it without charge.

This was a Christmas present for my 9 year old who kept using up the memory card on my point and shoot camera to take videos of his friends, stuffed animals, etc. Since I am all about letting his freak flag fly, I decided to give him his own camera and encourage this behavior. This camera has been great for that purpose. The lack of an SD card hasn't mattered. Most home videos longer than 5 minutes will never get watched again in our house. The only complaint is that you can't FF or REW within a video when reviewing it on the camera. We have used the editing software and it's what you'd expect for the price. Exporting in MPEG-4 format is great for sharing videos that even my Mom can open from an email.

I bought this against most of the reviews here for a few simple reasons:  Its linux compatable.  As a standard USB HID device I had absolutely no trouble installing it to work on my MythTV box so I can play (legal) ROM's.  Secondly, its cheap.  For the relatively light duty the unit is needed for there was no reason to spend large amounts of money for a game-pad.  Of course this also means the unit itself is cheaply made, and it is.   While I haven't had any problems with the unit, it physically feels cheap in its construction.  I can't however make any comment on the durability of the analog sticks as none of my games use them

My goodness, this is the best razor I've ever owned. With my old razor, I would shave for a half hour or more and I'd have stubble by the end of the day. With this one, I shaved 3+ weeks of beard growth in 15 minutes and three days later I still have hardly any stubble! I used to hate shaving and always had somewhat of a beard, but I think that'll change with this new razor!

It even has an electric display on it that tells you how dirty it is and comes with a cool charging/cleaning station. This is probably the best electric razor available today. When you look at it that way, the $260 price tag is a bargain!

I purchased this fountain for my two JRT's.  While one of them was ok with it the other did not like the gurgling noises it makes when the tank releases water. It preforms as advertised. It keeps the water nice and cool and holds a lot of it.. But I found I had to keep a separate bowl of water for my other dog as after the 2nd or 3rd gurgle she no longer drank out of this fountain.. It now sits empty in my basement..  I gave it four stars because it does work as advertised.. It just doesn't appeal to my sensitive dog..

I watched 6 movies this weekend and Tropic Thundar was the only one that kept my interest.  I was sure that I would dislike, I am not a Ben Stiller fan at all nor do I like Jack Black, but I heard the hype and I am a fan of Robert Downey Jr, so I thought why not.

What a pleasant surprise.  The plot was very original, the acting was top notch, and Tom Cruise's character made me laugh out loud and the fake trailers were genuis.  Even the bit parts like Matthew Mcauluny's charater were well done.  The special effects that the movie within the movie were very clever.

I use the wind mainly for business purposes so It didn't have to be too demanding. It is very portable, which is a huge plus for me always on the run. 

 Don't for get to add a 1gb memory stick to the wind because, why not? Memory is very inexpensive right now. It is also very easy to put in. A simple youtube search will show you exactly how to do it. Also don't forget that there is a screw hole underneath the sticker about voiding your warranty. Don't worry, it was confirmed by MSI that adding ram will NOT void the warranty. 

I looked at the other competing netbooks, but this one just seemed to stand out to me more than the others. I'm very happy with the decision to say the least.

This is the best money I've ever spent on a straightener.  I have had three in the past and none of them compare to a CHI.  It makes your hair so soft and smooth without looking dead on the ends.  Ceramic is a lot better for your hair and will not damage it like other titanium flat irons.  My hair dresser uses CHI products and now I'm finally able to have that "salon" look every day of the week.  This flat iron is excellent - I love it!

One of the very few products that does EXACTLY as it advertises. Overall, I'm very pleased with it. My German shepherd is a huge shedder, one of the worst shedding dogs I've ever had no matter how much she was brushed through with any other type of grooming tool.

What really interested me in the Furminator was how my dog reacted to it, she's very sensitive and even though she's a very obedient dog and would stand mostly still through the discomfort and/or pain of repetitively being brushed through with an undercoat rake or slicker brush; she didn't flinch once or back away during more than an hour of combing her with the Furminator on my first day using it. I wouldn't go so far as to say she enjoys grooming now, but she most definitely tolerates being combed with this over anything else I've used previously.

I've continually been astounded at the amount of fur I can brush out of her and how much more she sheds anyway. After changing my grooming routine with my dog to solely using the Furminator, I still comb out quite a good amount of hair (though possibly less than before) but more importantly my dog isn't shedding around the house as much.

My only complaint about the tool is that it creates a lot of static electricity and after a grooming session there is always more flyaway hair on the ground than in my wastebasket. As well as just as much stuck to both myself and the dog.

For some reason I knew that this would work, and it did. It stripped off clouds and clouds of cat fur from a cat that usually hates to be brushed. One note though, it is helpful to do this outside because if you do it inside you will have hair everywhere! Especially if you have carpet. Be forewarned.

I've tried a lot of protein shakes and this one just tops them all. The taste is excellent! So far i've tried vanilla ice cream and cookies 'n cream and they're both excellent, not too strong of flavor like most shakes. Which is a plus & it doesn't make your shake all thick and hard to take down. My friends also say chocolate mint is a good flavor too. This is an excellent post workout protein, since it absorbs a lot quicker than other shakes out there, ie. Muscle Milk. Muscle milk is a great product also, I use to take it before bed..since it slowly gets absorb so it'll last through the night. I'm sold this will be the only whey protein I will ever buy!

Overall a good body groomer, doesn't knick hard to reach places like other shavers, and it gets a really close shave.  However, it usually takes a few swipes to get all the hair because it doesn't seem to cut very well.  But I think it's worth it to not get cut.

After months of having to swap cables whenever I wanted to update my iPod,  get images off of my camera or even transfer ringtones via bluetooth, I finally bought this hub. It is WONDERFUL. I have my all-in-one printer, photo printer, iPod cable, camera cable and Bluetooth adapters plugged into it since it arrived and I have not had any issues.

It is small enough to fit on the back of my desk where it is easy to reach to plug in a flash drive, but out of sight to ease the clutter. The only con , in my opinion, is that it has an external power source. Not big enough of a worry to change my 5-star rating, it's just a nuisance when you have as many peripherals as I do!  :)

All-in-all, this is cheaper than buying 2-4 port hubs at my local B&M store and is smaller and more convenient.  If (heaven forbid) I find or buy more USB components, I will definitely get another one of these.

The Flip Mino is brilliantly simple.  I've had a couple of camcorders which are big, complicated, fragile, and eventually break.  The Mino is small, simple, sturdy with no moving parts.  If you're looking for something easy to use to take high quality home videos, you've found it.

It recharges over the USB connector when you plug it into your Mac/PC.  It seems to have way more charge than needed to take 60 minutes of video, so it might just end up being fully charged all the time (unlike my camcorders which were never ready to go).  And I prefer the rechargeable over replaceable batteries that just end up in landfills.

The video quality of the compression software was also good, though the compressor itself took a long time.  In all fairness, this is probably because I have an old slow G4 Mac -- time to upgrade.  And you can easily grab the raw .avi files right off of the camera if you want to work with uncompressed files.

This book is perfect for all married couples to read, especially with the high rate of divorce in our day and time.

The movie Fireproof is based off this novel, so if you do not like to read then I suggest watching the movie.  Either way, it will hit home if you are in a relationship.

The novel lets all couples get more in depth with "the love dare" reading each dare as it is presented in the novel, with a page for you to write your comments down in.  Great tool for any struggling couples.

The movie does not portray all dares, but it still leaves you with the concept of what marriage should be.

Had owned previous model, EW176WC, which performed well but collected mold from time to time.  Left it somewhere while traveling, so ordered two of the new ones (EW1270AC).  Much improved, runs longer on a tank, but  water stream is slightly thinner.  Better materials, better design.  No mold.
  Received intact on or about 1 July 2006.  Opened one upon receipt, saved other for future use while traveling or at work.  Opened second one yesterday, 9 August 2006.  Nozzle was missing.  Called Panasonic today.  Got the runaround.  We can't do that, call this number.  They can do it.  After several phone calls (seven with people) they finally said they would not send the part!
They insisted I contact the seller.  So now I have contacted Amazon.  I told them I don't want to return the item; I just want the nozzle.  (Have not heard back yet.)               How much does it cost, you ask.  Five bucks.  Fine. If I need to, I will order the part.  But you can believe without doubt I will not buy a Panasonic product for the rest of my life. 
                     P.S.:  Had a similar experience with a Panasonic fax machine about two years ago; thought I had learned my lesson then.  (I went through 4 or 5 of them before the warranty ran out.)  But how hard is it to screw up such a simple product as an oral irrigator?
See the review by Charles Hine, dated 16 May 2006, below.

11 August 2006:  Wow, Amazon is sending me a new irrigator along with a prepaid return label for the incomplete one.
Did I say I would never buy a Panasonic product?  Well, I take that back.  I might buy some more irrigators -- but only from Amazon.  (I have no affiliation with Amazon.)

14 August 2006:  Received replacement irrigator from Amazon, complete with nozzle.  They sent me an email explaining that their only possible recourse was to send the complete item.
Works for me.

HDMI Port is behind the battery, this is a major design problem.  You have to remove the battery to use HDMI.  They could have placed this port where the component video port is located.  Also, to use HDMI you will need to buy an [HDMI to HDMI Mini] cable.

You need a very fast machine to edit video shot with this camera, I didn't have much luck with Pentium 4, 2.8ghz using the trial version of Pinnacle Studio 11, the video was garbage, make sure you have a dual core processor as the minimum requirements for AVCHD editing require.  I also have Sony Vegas Movie Studio Platinum which touts support for Panasonic AVCHD in the updated version 8.0c, but have had no luck getting this software to open the video stream files.  Sony suopport has been horrible addressing my issue.

It seems almost a year after AVCHD, there are still issues trying to edit video on personal computers.

If you have a Blu-ray player make sure to get the Panasonic VW-BN1 DVD Burner to copy your footage to disc and play it back.  Also this burner does not accept +R media you must have DVD-R (4.5GB) or DVD-R Dual Layer (8GB) to write your media to disc.  Playback from disc was excellent using Samsung BDP-1400 Blu-ray player.

This is so cool to slice up your own food.  Do you know how much you save per pound by cutting meat yourself rather than buying prepackaged sliced deli meat ?  Alot !!!  Meat, cheeses, vegies and fruit slice beautifully.  Clean up only takes a few min.  Great buy...

I've had this running for almost a month now, and I've had no problems with it.  You could hear it hum a bit, but I set it back on the mat I had for their old bowls of water, and didn't notice it any more.  The hum was carried into the hard floor which made it louder. 

It's a good product, but could use some refinement.  First, when you fill it up, you then have to tip over the water container to put it back in place.  It doesn't leak much while tipping it over, but it does leak a bit.  That could have been easily corrected in the design using a rubber washer and spring.  The other issue is of energy use.  It uses very very little power..no issue here.  It's just there are dozens of these adapters plugged in everywhere using power and I would like to see more efficient use of power.  I don't really think this needs to run 24x7.  A simple circuit could be added to filter the water occasionally, and turn it on when the cat comes near it.  

Excluding the refinements that could be made, I think it's a very good product, and the cat's love it.  No more running the shower faucet for Kitty to get a drink.  Overall I would recommend it.  Much better than the old bowl of water.

This is "nclm"'s wife. Can't beat this for great tasting yogurt which is simple to make! Very reasonable price for this machine, too! I purchase one quart of plain yogurt at the store to use as a starter, simply use 1/3 cup of starter to 4 cups of milk and in 5 hours I have perfect yogurt & am saving so much money on this healthy treat. We are gobbling it up like crazy.

Woody Allen can never make Manhattan or Annie Hall again. Simply put, the world isn't smart enough for that brand of movie being made. people don't get that way of communicating, studios don't get why anyone would make a movie for the art and so on. Woody himself isn't that person anymore. he is a man in his 70s, and he can't keep stooping these young women. That being said, it could be nice to see him as an old man, married to a woman his own age, in some sort of adventure, not unlike Manhattan Murder Mysteries again, but, what with the US studios not fronting him the cash, I guess he won't make movies where he ties up parts of Manahattan again?

All that being said, Woody Allen is timeless, yet he keeps fresh, and keeps up with current actors and so on. His language may at times seem a bit archaic, but I don't think we suffer from hearing people talk properly. The actors he works with adore him and the freedom he offers them. He is an actors director, trusting that they know their craft. That shows, also in this movie.

Should you preffer humour and cringe at drama with people behaving in a... sexually embarrassing way,w ell then this is probably not the movie for you.

If you love watching movies where the relationship between human beings, with all their beauty, all their faults, desires, cruelty, egotism and horny behaviour out there for all to see, well, then this is the movie for you.

Sure, Woody doesn't have a real grasp of Europe anno 2008, or for that matter, New York, but I love him for it. The fact that he ignores what people think he should do, and ignores the bland movie making going on these days, and just does his thing. He is my hero, and I am not ashamed to say so.

I loved this movie, it was a real shot in the arm for his body of work (I couldn't stand Cassandra's Dream), and I reccomend it warmly.

However, my top 3 Woody Allen movies of all time, are still Manhattan, Stardust Memories and Broadway Danny Rose.

I actually purchased this for a friend and he loved it!  He has used it a couple of times and he says it was the best mixer he has ever used.  After using lower grade mixers, they didn't stand up to the kitchen aid mixers as far as quality and performance.  This is a beast of a mixer, it is very heavy and well made.  I purchased the item on a monday and recieved it on either wednesday or thursday.  And this was right before XMAS too!  Plus this was the best price I have found anywhere, free shipping and I found an online coupon.  I highly recommend this product from Amazon!

A delicious cup of coffee every morning!  No more trips to Dunkin Donuts! I buy the variety pack, so I don't get bored!  I have found buying the k cups at Bed Bath & Beyond very convenient and reasonably priced as I use the 20% coupon. The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because sometimes it only brews about 1/2 cup.  Haven't really figured out why yet, but could be something I'm doing wrong.

HP has hit a homerun looks/design wise with the Mini 1000 series.  Build quality is excellent considering the low price, definitely as sturdy as any other full notebook I've owned (HP zd7000, Dell XPS M1330).  I chose this netbook primarily for the sleek design...it's the lightest 10" netbook I believe.  In my humble opinion, every other netbook looks like a cheapy notebook.  The HP Mini really does look/feel more expensive than it is...almost Mac like, dare I say.

The infinity screen is very nice, extremely bright.  Some people complain about the glare, but seriously, who are these people that use their net/notebooks in direct lighting?  I'd say the keyboard is also very good,  but nearly excellent.  The size is right for touch typing and is better than any other NETbooks out there, but the flat keys can lead to some mis-types.  Battery life is decent considering the 3-cell battery...nearly 3 hrs with medium screen brightness and wifi on.  It should be noted that the battery is LITHIUM POLYMER, not the standard lithium ion cells in most other notebooks which allows for the flat shape and slightly better battery life.  The trackpad is also pretty good usewise, the side mounted buttons did take a day to get used too.

My husband and I love our Flip, or as we affectionately call him, Filip.  The best part about Filip, he's easy to use and easy to bring along - anywhere!  Last year we brought him to Bay to Breakers and had a blast recording the day's events... No naked man wearing a baby bonnet and pushing a keg in a stroller is worth lugging a heavy camcorder around.  

The picture quality is great - especially when played back on your computer or TV.  Our home movies have never looked so good (hey... I know what you're thinking...)!

Seriously, the Flip is an awesome value, simple to use, and fun to have... it's one of those 'luxury items' that you have don't have to feel guilty about buying because it costs so little!  Go get yourself a Flip!

I purchased the Omron HJ-112 a few weeks ago and love it.  It easily slips into my front pocket and is not so big and bulky that it is uncomfortable.  It also appears to be very accurate, I take the same walk a few times a week and it always counts steps within an acceptable range.  My favorite feature is that it stores your data for 7 days.

I love my rottweiler shepherd mix.  She is a gentle loving dog.  However, at the change of season, she sheds so much, that I considered finding her a new home.  The amount of hair in my house is overwhelming.  I usually bathe and brush her myself because of the cost involved in professional grooming.  At my wits end this year, I decided to take a risk and purchase the Furminator Large de-shedding tool.  It works!  During the first week, I brushed her every other day for about an hour (keeping the vacuum next to me so I could suck up all the hair as I brushed her).  The difference was noticeable immediately.  Her coat shined as if she had just been bathed.  After the first week, I no longer had to vacuum my home every day.  I now brush her once a week with the Furminator and her coat is brilliant.  I know the extreme shedding season is over, but I don't have to bathe her as much now.  And the best part of all is that she loves it!  In addition, the ordering process was smooth, quick and easy.  The purchase arrived in a couple of days.

I've had this 1tb drive for about a week and twice when I've gone to this new drive it shows no files in all of my folders but does show that I'm using 200gb of space on it. Rebooting my computer made no difference. Unplugging it and then plugging it back in "restores" the files and all is good but I'm not that happy with "loosing" 200+gb of data. Yes, it has the current software loaded. 

I have another 250gb external HD that has worked without any problems for the last 2 years. It's loud but has never "lost" my data. This Seagate is very quiet and much better looking then my older one. I was either going to get the WD My Book 1tb drive or this one but after reading the reviews of the My Book I went with the Seagate even though it was more money.

Woody Allen doesn't make great movies anymore, but he does make good ones once in a while, and "Vicky Cristina Barcelona" is a fun little romantic comedy that brings a sexy sense of adventure to the sun-drenched Spanish coast. Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are twenty-something women, best friends since college, who spend the summer in Barcelona while Vicky works on her master's thesis on Catalan identity. Cristina's flirtatious nature encourages a local painter named Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) to invite the ladies on a spur-of-the-moment romantic tryst in Oviedo. Vicky, the sensible woman with a staid fianc?back in the States, is taken aback by Juan Antonio's effrontery. Cristina, a woman who thrives on passion and new experiences, is intrigued, setting in motion what will be an uncommon and unforgettable summer in Barcelona.

Penelope Cruz gives a nice performance as Juan Antonio's volatile, talented ex-wife Maria Elena. Cruz is always much better in her native Spanish than in English, and here she speaks both. It's nice to see her playing this jealous, slightly scary woman instead of her usual protagonist. Vicky is torn between her plans for a sensible marriage and her capacity for spontaneity and romance. Cristina is unconventional, throws herself into her passions, but her restlessness won't allow her to be happy with anything for long. Neurotic on both counts, but played more for light irony than drama. Javier Bardem doesn't have much to do except be charming and generous with his affections, but he does both with flair. "Vicky Cristina Barcelona" is just good bohemian fun at a jaunty pace with an attractive cast in an exotic locale. Subtitles are available in English SDH and Spanish.

I have owned mine for about 6 months now and I am very satisfied with it.  It has all the features that one could want.  It makes a great cup of coffee and is very easy to keep clean. 

My only issue is with the fact that it is a bit awkward filling the coffeemaker with water.  Pouring the water into the small space behind the filter takes a bit of skill - something I don't necessarily have when I first wake up.  I suppose it is fortunate that I can get it ready the night before and set the timer.

My biggest pet peeve with any coffee maker is the fact that with some you must be extremely careful pouring a cup if you don't want to dribble a little bit.  We have two different Mr Coffee coffeemakers at work that result in slight spillage almost every time a cup is poured.  The Cuisinart, however is practically perfect in this respect.  Never a spilled drop when pouring a cup even when I am not particularly careful.

For the money, the machine is quite good. I am glad I bought it. However, a few design moldifications would have made it better. To wit, the space between spouts and top of coffee cup is too tight for all but the lowest slung cups and the space for the steamer is far too short unless you put machine on a pedestal. A heavier base, to keep machine from slipping when loading the coffee holder, would also have been nice. Otherwise, it is great.

First of all, I absolutely love the device itself. Without going into details about all of the wonderful features of this device, which other reviewers here have already done to death, I will just say that this is one of the most impressive gadgets I've ever played with. The things this little device can do and do very well are just mind blowing. Alas, if only it had a reasonably powerful battery to go with it.....


I'm very disappointed with the short battery life. Sure, if you just listen to songs you'll probably get ~35 hours of playtime as claimed by Apple, but who amongst us bought this expensive device just to listen to songs? It's too expensive to be used simply as an MP3 player. For me, it was the Touch's wi-fi capability that was THE main buying point and in that department I found the result to be decidedly mixed. While the wi-fi feature works flawlessly and beautifully, it just saps the life out of the battery in no time. In my experience, using wi-fi continuously drains the battery (to the 20% level) within 2-3 hours. Even if you implement all the power saving features recommended by Apple & other users, you would still be lucky to get 2 days of playtime even under normal usage (1-2 hours of internet and 4-5 hours of music & apps). I don't mind charging my Touch every day but the downside is every charge brings the battery that much closer to its end, which is about 400 charges according to Apple. In other words, this $200 + device will be basically useless within 2 years unless you pay Apple $80 to have the battery replaced. Just think about that. Your beloved Touch will be useless within 2 years, or sooner if you charge it every day, unless you've no problem forking over $80 to have the battery replaced. 

Conclusion: A+ for the device, B- for the battery.

I went against my own logic and tried to go the cheap route by putting some Hartz brand flea stuff on the cats.  Duh!  Water would have worked better.  After reading the reviews about Advantage, I ordered some and received it quickly.  I could not BELIEVE the mass exodus of fleas from our two cats (who are always indoors by the way).  I feel badly because I didn't realize how heavily they were infested until I saw the flea "puddles" they'd leave after meat-loafing in the same spot for awhile.  It hasn't been 12 hours yet but I'm impressed so far..........

Being a fan of American history, I found this DVD to be very entertaining and educational. Growing-up in the Boston area, I was facinated by the depiction of Boston in the 1700's. Being from this area, you take for granted the vast amount of history that is all around you.

The movie is incredibly well done and the acting is as close to perfect as you can get. Paul Giamatti is a gifted actor as is his counterpart, Laura Linney. Casting, set design, costuming, script were all exceptional (You will swear that David Morse IS George Washington). You will get engrosed in this film and form a bond with the characters, which makes Part 7 so heartbreaking.

It makes you appreciate the trials and sacrifice that our forefathers endured to give us the freedom and luxuries we enjoy today. It's a painful excercise to compare the politicians of today's world to the men of character, sacrifice and honor that founded this country. I pray that they do not look down upon us in disbelief and sorrow.
As is stated by Adams in the last scene: "Oh, posterity. You will never know how much it cost us to preserve your freedom. I hope that you will make a good use of it. If you do not, I shall repent in heaven that I ever took half the pains... to preserve it."

Developed by sci-fi veteran, Ronald D. Moore, not only is Battlestar Galactica the best show on television these days, it is television at its frakin' best. The sci-fi epic chronicles the journey of the last surviving humans from the Twelve Colonies of Kobol after the nuclear annihilation of their home planet (Caprica) by the Cylons (an alien Empire of machines intent on destroying the "inferior" human race) in their search for a new home (the mythical and long-lost thirteenth colony, Earth). The survivors (approximately 50,000 in all) are led by President Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell) and Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos) in a fleet of ships with the Battlestar Galactica, a old submarine-like battleship ("The Bucket"), at the Fleet's command.  Season One of BSG opens with the Cylons (which have now evolved into human form) in relentless pursuit of the Galactica and its "ragtag fleet" of survivors, and ends with a cliffhanger.

THE HISTORY OF BSG:  Battlestar Galactica is a "re-imagining" of 1978 television series.  In 2003, a four-hour Sci Fi Channel Miniseries became the pilot of the 2004 television series, which premiered on Sky One in the UK and Ireland in 2004, and then on the Sci Fi Channel in the U.S. in 2005.  Season One seamlessly picks up where the Miniseries ended. The fourth (and final) season of BSG will begin on April 4, 2008.

THE THREE-PART STRUCTURE OF BSG. BSG involves three equally-fascinating, intertwined storylines: (1) the Colonial survivors' quest for Earth; (2) the possible psychosis of Dr. Gaius Baltar (James Callis), whose every thought and interraction is closely scrutinized by a beautiful Cylon incarnation (Tricia Helfer) (one wonders, is she real or Baltar's fantasy?), and (3) the Caprican Resistance efforts of crash-landed pilots Helo (Tahmoh Penikett), Boomer (Grace Park), and others.  Ultimately, BSG is a lesson in the value of human love.

THE APPEAL OF BSG: BSG transcends the sci-fi genre, which is what makes it so appealing to both young and old, male and female viewers, alike. Critics have referred to the show as a "space opera." It is an intelligent drama that confronts cutting-edge issues, set in Deep Space. In that respect, BSG is a departure from other science fiction shows like Star Trek. In BSG, traditional male roles have been reversed. Military leaders such as President Laura Roslin and unconventional Viper fighter pilots such Starbuck (Katee Sackhoff) and Boomer are played by actresses. The alien Cylons have evolved out of "flawed" humanity. Most of the show's human characters struggle with personal issues: dysfunctional relationships, alcoholism, smoking, and a variety of possible mental illnesses. Cylon blood is resistant to human disease. The show resonates with post-9/11 moral and ethical issues: terrorism, sleeper cells, suicide bombers, the torture of prisoners, the erosion of civil liberties, and conflicting religious beliefs.

All in all, including customs duties, the DVD cost me ?6 - so, not cheap! But if you're from the UK and wondering whether it's worth the cost while waiting for it to be released here, I would say just go for it.

After having kept it up most days for two weeks I returned to my physio for a sports massage.  As my back, shoulders and glutes are so much stronger and relaxed than before due to the workout, my physio was able to dig really deep into my back for the first time.  I would hever have thought an exercise DVD could actually help my sore bits but it really has.  I feel so much more relaxed and energised and I'm beginning to get free from pain for the first time in years!  Thanks Tracy!!

It's all good but the arms sections are really amazing.  Already I am getting angles on my shoulders and standing taller. The DVD is also so special in the sense that you actually want to do it.  Who knew I could ever want to get up an hour early to work out?? I could do it all first time round despite being unfit. It's super hard but not impossible and left me feeling nicely worked out.

Tracy's instruction method is also great: gentle, kind but authoratative. You don't need to think about it, just follow her on the screen and it's all figured out for you. Yeah, I agree it's not the best when she moves onto another pose while you're still facing downwards away from the screen, but after a few sessions you get a feel for what's coming next. Don't be put off too much by reports of her not cuing enough, overall it's a good thing she doesn't talk too much. Who wants to be yelled at first thing in the morning? Stylistically the video is beautiful too.

I personally don't like racing around when doing fitness as my knees hurt easily so this is perfect for me. My heart rate stays elevated throughout and I work up a bit of a sweat so I feel like I'm doing cardio as well as toning up. If you liked Callanetics you ought to love this.

I was looking for a replacement for my $12 keyboard and wanted one that would both feel right when typing and was responsive for other tasks.  I am a not hard core gamer.  I have a few, but that's not the primary purpose of the keyboard for me.  The G11 is exactly the same as the pricier G15 except for the LCD screen which I thought would be distracting.  Besides, I build computers and have other programs to monitor the functions I need to watch.

THE GOOD: Easy and painless set up.  Responsive touch and the keys are where my fingers think they ought to be.  I have big hands and long fingers and this keyboard feels great. 54 macros keys (I won't say "programmable macros" because that's what a macro is!).  Enter your name, your e-mail address or addresses, passwords, repeated phrases... anything.  You have 54 keys.  Macros are easy to enter and store.  Logitech--this is a great idea! The keyboard comes with profiles for gamers, but just ignore if you're not a gamer. Blue background lights on keys are very nice.  At first I thought I would not like them, but they are very nice to look at and add ambiance. I don't type or play games in the dark so at first the blue illuminated keys did not have any appeal to me.  But now I really like them. They tell me when my OS has detected the keyboard or if there is a general failure to initiate. Key letters are etched in so they don't wear over time. Amazon had the best price I could find and I received my keyboard two days BEFORE expected delivery!  Amazon's service is excellent!

THE BAD: How to remember which of the 54 keys has what!  I've seen shorter NFL play books.  I still like the idea and use the keys.  If you are a hard core gamer, then look at the G15 or G19.  The G11 lacks LCD for game support.

THE BOTTOM LINE:  Great keyboard for typing, playing games and surfing the web.  Use the macro keys for logins and passwords.  With the macro keys this board is fun as well as highly functional.  You will like the blue illuminated keys.  Highly recommended

I have been an Apple fan since the first Macintosh introduced in 1984.  The progression over the years has been very impressive especially in the portable line.  I do not have any negative comments about the MacBook 13.3" only glowing praise.  It does all that most people would need and then some.  Easy to use, great display, fast, big hard drive, plenty of RAM, wonderful operating system, good battery life, wi-fi ready, etc.  Now that you can get software to run (ugh) Windows (for those who have not seen the light), why use anything else.

Anyone looking for a good read will be floored by Alan Moore's 12-issue classic, Watchmen. In this maxiseries, we are shown a world rife with Cold War paranoia, moral decay, superheroes, conspiracies, and Nixon. It starts off with the mad rantings of a half-insane and fascistic hero, Rorschach, who is trying to solve a mystery of a murdered superhero. Although he is beyond creepy (issue 6 almost will make you pity criminals), the scary part is, most of his theories are accurate. From the spineless Dan Dreiberg, to the robotic Dr. Manhattan, this is a story of complex characters, Machiavellian schemes, and a world not too different from our own. Even non-comic fans will enjoy.

The compact size make it easy to fit in the jacket pockets whiling riding. The authentic Water-proof and shaking control are critical for shooting while moving on the snow or under water. Video and sound quality is not a big concern for me, but I know it's at least as good as other regular camcorders at this price range. To my surprise, the night video quality is also very good, clear and no much noise point. Battery life is also good at low temperature (my cell phone battery usually stops working very soon after I get onto slope)
So far, I'm very satisfied with it. There are only a few minor UI issues I don't like. e.g. the buttons of camera and video taping are small and so close, that I cannot operate while wearing snow gloves. Also, no button to switch flash, so I have to change setting by menu each time.
So overall, I would strong recommend it for sport purpose.

I wasn't sure about spending so much money on an electric shaver, but from my husbands reaction it was money well spent. My husband says its as close to a hand razor as you can get and when I feel his face I can't feel the difference. He says its easy and quick to use and very quiet as well. I give this an A+

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)

      




For my one-hundredth review, I'm happy to give a classic rating to "New Moon" by Stephenie Meyer.

While there is a lot more things going on in "New Moon" than the first book in the series, "Twilight", the most redeeming quality about the book is that it seems like it could happen.  The characters are real people, and the events of (most of) the book are refreshingly realistic.  Bella is a real girl with insecurities, and Edward, while he clearly has his heart in the right place, is flawed in his approach.  This flaw leads to his absence from the majority of the book, which is when the story truly begins.

Stephenie Meyer knows her protagonist, Bella, very well.  She knows how to drive the story forward, specifically through Bella's eyes, making the reader feel exactly what she's feeling.  After the first few chapters, we (Bella/reader) begin to spend time with a werewolf and nice-guy named Jacob Black, who we grow to love.  Jacob is a much different character from Edward, but both of their motivations are similar:  They both want Bella.  But Bella sees Jacob as a comfort zone, a constant in her life that she can depend on.  She uses that, thus using him.  Jacob doesn't mind, but one can't help but feel sympathy for him--relate to him.

Like Bella, we become torn with what we want.  Do we want her with Jacob, who we know loves her even if she just sees him as a friend?  Do we want her with her true, but misdirected, lover Edward?  All of these questions drive the plot forward in this extremely well-paced story by Meyer, who is a master at plotting.  Every turn that the story takes is unpredictable, and original.  We meet an array of new vampires, and things get a lot more dangerous.  

In a market where teen-lit writers see it fit to make long-winded 500+ page stories out of nothing, Meyer utilizes the length of her book, putting the high page count to good use.  She separates herself from the rest of the writers in her genre with this solid series about vampires, that is really simply about people.

10/10 Classic.

I used this when my baby boy was a newborn.  He was born in November, and the Swaddle Me was nice, and soft, and cozy.  We read about the virtues of swaddling in the "Happiest Baby on The Block" book, while I was still pregnant. I used this from the very beginning, even in the hospital.  I was able to get it on and off quickly, even for the NUMEROUS diaper changes that were required for a breastfed baby! Even my hubby was able to get our baby swaddled with this blanket! :)

Finally a digital camcorder that won't break your bank but is not skimping on the features. I tried other digital camcorders in the past, from the cheaper $100 range, and they all have two major flaws: lack of image stability control and poor performance in low light. This one overcomes both and I'm very happy with it. It also takes decent pictures, although it doesn't match current cameras resolution.

Overall all, I am pleased with this monitor.  My only complaint is that the cuff is a little ornery.  It's molded and works best on a bare arm.  My concern would be somebody who has difficulty manipulating objects might have trouble with it.  The memory feature is great and the big numbering is easy to read.

If you've enjoyed drinking coffee all your life, then you deserve to own a Keurig coffee maker now.

I've drank coffee all my life.  Even my mother use to give me coffee with milk in my bottle when I was just a baby.  Back then, I was probably a stressed-out, high-strung, irrepressible shaky little bundle of nerves all through my child life.  I've spoken with a few cats over the years who were going through catnip withdrawals. So, I can relate wholeheartedly.  Some cats use to chase dogs.  Well anyway...

I can't remember any day in my life that I haven't had any coffee in the morning, although I will say that I don't care to drink coffee throughout the day like some people do.  I'll drink my six cups of coffee only in the morning before school or work and that will be it for me for the rest of the day.  I'll know I've had enough coffee when people see me glowing in the dark when I rush out of the house early in the morning. Some mornings, I've polished off a whole pot of coffee.   I don't have to be at work till 8 AM but I still get up at around 4 AM so I can start slamming coffee.  Sometimes, I may fall asleep again in front of my first cup of coffee, but when I snap out of my drowsiness, I'll gulp that cold cup down and then rush to the kitchen to make my next cup.  I may slam about 4 or 5 more cups of coffee into me within the next half hour before I bolt out the door to start my day.  I don't know how some people can just fly out of bed and then fly out the door to get on with their day without coffee.  Of course, some people will rush out to the local Starbuck's at the corner and buy that one four dollar cup of coffee and that will be all that they need for the day.  Just one cup?  And at about four freakin' dollars a cup?  Forget that!

Now listen up my fellow coffee lovers.  This Keurig coffee maker is the greatest coffee maker I have ever experienced.  It'll heat up water instantly and will having you drinking your first cup of coffee within the first minute you turn your Keurig on in the morning.  It has a built in timer so that you can set it to be ready to brew your first cup the moment you approach your coffee maker if you're someone who just can't wait a whole minute for it to be ready. I've become more patient since I bought my Keurig.  

Now here's what's really unique about the Keurig coffee maker.  It brews one cup at a time.  What you buy for coffee are called K-cups.  Pre-packaged cups of various flavored coffees that you put in the machine to brew one cup of coffee.  There are hundreds of different flavors of national and international coffees (caffeinated and decaffeinated), and  various flavored teas, and cocoas that you buy in boxes and keep in a basket or their original boxes next to your Keurig machine.  

When you buy your Keurig coffee maker, you will get an assortment of various flavored coffees and teas to sample to get you started with understanding the beauty of this great new coffee maker that you've brought into your home.  But, like I said, there are hundreds of other flavored coffees designed in the K-cup format for your Keurig coffee maker.  You'll get order forms and website ordering information available with your Keurig.  

I've bought my Keurig at a Linen and Things department store, but there are other stores that sell the Keurig as well.  I was told that you can get one at Target, but my local Target doesn't seem to have it.  Anyway, at Linen and Things, they also carry only a couple of flavored K-cup coffees sold next to the Keurig.  Usually, I'll see some K-cups from Green Mountain who I think is directly licensed and distributed with the Keurig coffee maker.  Their K-cups sell at $9.99 per box (of 18 K-cups).  So, at that price, plus California sales tax (7.75%) that works out to about 59.8 cents per cup of coffee.  That's really not too bad but you can still get it cheaper if you shop smart.  Even when you order these K-cups on line directly with the K-cup companies, you'll still pay about 55 cents per cup PLUS the cost of shipping, which makes each cup even more expensive. 

I've learned that the best deal available is by buying my K-cups directly through Amazon.  There are various sources that are selling K-cups through Amazon and still charge shipping costs, but there are a few K-cup distributors that sell K-cups at the lowest price possible, plus charge NO sales tax or shipping costs.  Through Amazon, I see that Target sells a box of K-cups for $59.99 and that's for 108 K-cups.  Even without the cost of shipping (yet to be added), that still works out to 55 cents per cup, minimum.  So, Sorry Target, I think I'll pass.  That is not the best deal.

I buy my K-cups at $20 for two boxes of 25 K-cups each. (50 K-cups for twenty bucks). With no sales tax and free shipping so that works out to just 40 cents per cup.  Just forty cents!!!   And there are many flavors available to choose from.  So YOU tell me.  Would your rather pay four dollars for one cup of coffee (like at Starbucks), or just 40 cents per cup?  Sure, your cup may be a little smaller, but you can always have another cup, and then another cup, and then another cup, and then another cup, and then another cup, and so on and so on and so on...... How about 10 cups of coffee for four bucks, instead of just one?

You can also buy a special reusable K-cup filter so that you can still brew your own favorite coffee from the can if you prefer.  This Keurig is not just limited to manufactured K-cups.  

So, check it out my fellow coffee lovers. You'll love having this Keurig in your house when you have guests.  They will love having options of which flavored coffee they'd like to try, if you'll keep various flavors available.  I still like trying new coffees.  I generally like to stick to the more BOLD flavored coffees.  Call me crazy but I enjoy a mildly bitter harsh burn in my throat when I'm drinking my coffee.  "Tres Intense" (which I guess means Extra Bold) is a common term I see on the boxes of my favorite K-cup coffees.  So far, my favorite K-cup comes from Van Houtte and it's called "Eclipse Blend."  I've ordered about six boxes of it last month.  I'm down to two boxes already so I better order some more soon.

I love my Keurig!  If you're a coffee connoisseur like me, you'll love this machine too.

I love this brand and this product.  What I think sets this product apart from most protein powders I've tried, is that it actually tastes good!  It's got everything you want and need in a protein powder whether you're training or trying to lose weight.  It's great before and/or after a workout and as a meal replacement when you're on the go and don't have time to eat right.  But the best part of this product is that because it tastes good, you will use it.  Most protein powders I have tried just taste terrible.  And I just won't use them if I cannot stomach getting them down.  This stuff is good.  I like the tropical punch mixed with water so it tastes like fruit punch. It looks like Pepto Bismol, but don't let that deter you...it tastes great.  The vanilla ice cream flavor makes a great smoothie with fresh fruit and skim milk.  I cannot say enough good things about this product, it's quality and taste.  If you've tried protein powders before but just can't tolerate their nasty taste, I would highly recommend you try this product.

Our kitten Henry was really the first to notice "mr squirrel" even though we had the squirrel toy for a year before we had Henry, as well as several other Dr. Noys toys like this for cats. Henry carries Mr.S all over the house. The funny thing is he and our beagle boy play with it, its like a game as to who has the squirrel. Sadly the original Mr. S went to the great kitty toy heaven when after 5 months of this game the beagle finally figured out the right way to tear him open. But in true fashion we had a spare on hand as we were terrified something may happen to Mr. S and kill their game. 
This is a great product, tough, durable, and cute. We have also since bought "Nuts" the Mr Noys dog version of the squirrel that squeaks. And in real life the squirrel doesn't look quite so odd like in the Amazon pic, it doesn't look nearly as road kill-ey. :)

Hi, the KitchenAid mixer is one of the best acquisitions that my wife and I ever make. My wife it's happy because it's strong, stable and works perfect, and I'm happy because I got cakes, muffins and all class of desserts just from the oven.

I have used Quicken for over 12 years.  Whenever I got a new version, it always worked for me.  But, it has too many things on it that I don't need.

One day into my Aspire and I really love it. For starters, the wireless range is so much greater than my old laptop. Formerly, I was having trouble grabbing the signal from upstairs. Now, I have a great connection and all my neighbors'networks are visible too. The weight is amazing, the resolution is fine and it does everything I need. The XP software works just like on the big units. The mousepad is surprisingly easy to use. If you don't like hitting the left button, you can just tap on the pad for the same result.

Drawbacks: My wife thinks everything is too small in the smaller screen. (I wear reading glasses anyway). You only see about 60% of what is visible on a standard laptop, though side-to-side it's the same. The unit has fingerprint marks all over its beautiful little case. But, in my opinion, all of these are minor in comparison with the ease of use and portability of this unit. 

In short. It's fun. I'd recommend it.

Pleased with the ease of use of the camera.  Picture quality is decent for the video's I will be making and price paid.  Has limitations in low light but I knew that at time of purchase.

The new special edition costs twice as much for &quot;special features&quot; that should have been included in the first place.  I say forget that.  One of the few films of wonder that satisfies the whole family (I know one family which used to sit around and watch this on VHS, quoting every &quot;fun&quot; line) without showing any naughty bits or using naughty language.  Casting this ensemble alone was a work of genius.  So, when you get home tonight, having been climbing the Cliffs of Insanity, do yourself a favor and get this one.  It's also a good &quot;guilty pleasure&quot; film for the collection of the single man.  I should know.

Sure, the idea of a backlit keyboard sounds fun, but like many of us, I am pretty finicky when it comes to keyboards and mice; a lousy keyboard or a poor fitting mouse can be murder upon one's productivity. 

Installing my Saitek Eclipse II just a few moments ago, I am already blown away by how nice this keyboard feels on my hands; for me, they keystrokes are a perfect balance between resistance and ease of movement. Keys move smoothly with a quick rebound and I instantly feel as if I am typing faster; something I haven't felt in years. 

My instant appraisal: five stars. This is simply a great feeling keyboard and I am absolutely pleased with my purchase.

A few caveats: I watch television shows only on DVD through netflix, and only after hearing good things about a series from several people over a long period of time. In other words, I don't watch that much of it, and never follow a show from week to week. 


BSG is one of the best shows to have come my way in the last five years. But, more than a lot of shows, it's iconoclastic for its genre and tosses out a lot of tried-and-true Sci-Fi rigmarole. So, this is not traditional but well-executed science fiction. This is quite unusual but still well-executed science fiction. 

So what should you expect? 

First, the "exotic" feel of traditional Sci-Fi is almost entirely absent from this show. Occasionally you'll see a "centurion" (robot desiged to kill humans), a battle between space fighters, or "faster-than-light jumps" where space ships instantly move from point to point in the universe. That's about it. The plot is constructed so that humans have embraced older technology to survive against an AI rebellion (the Cylons), so you'll even see things like corded-phones. Clothing and hair cuts are also recognizably modern. The characters say "frak" instead of "f*ck" when they swear, but otherwise there is no future slang. The bottom line is that BSG puts recognizable characters in extraordinary situations and environments. They're in space; they're on the run from a human-created robot "race" called the cylons; otherwise, they could be your friends and neighbors. Their motivations are not foreign or exotic or futuristic. 

This is a show about people in dire straights, trying to make a new beginning. It's also a show about morality and survival. The Cylons, it seems, do not simply want to annihilate people, but they want to "become human" in some way or another. Some of are built and programmed to look and act human - can these be killed or tortured without reservation or hesitation? A lot of BSG is about fear, accusations, "traitors," and what kinds of lines can be drawn between "us" and "them." 

BSG is also quite ambitious in that it eschews from the beginning having characters who are, on the whole, likable or unlikable. Sometimes you'll admire these people, sometimes you'll be aghast at moments of poor judgment. If you want to grow consistently fond of certain characters, to trust them and believe in them, this show will frustrate you enormously. Everyone makes mistakes in this show, but they're not hopelessly flawed. It's a tough line to walk across the board. I would think it's very difficult to write characters like Commander Adama who function as a father-figure and leader to the entire ship but who (unlike "Captain Picard") sometimes just screw it up. The audience has to believe they "would" blow it occasionally. For the most part, BSG's characters seem real without seeming flagrantly inconsistent, something the fans appreciate. However, there are times when characters just don't have much to say about serious actions and consequences, and it can be hard to go along with a compounding chain of events. This is why I rate the first season four stars instead of five. 

A brief example. In the first episode, the humans are running for their lives (in space) and the Cylons catch up with them every 33 minutes before the humans "jump" to another point in space. Mid-way through the episode, the commander comes up with a very basic plan to separate the fleet to try and "shake off" the cylons. It's hard to believe that this plan was not considered for the first 250 times (literally). I think sometimes the "drama" of the show downplays resourcefulness to a questionable degree. No one on BSG is much of a planner, and given the circumstances, that can be little hard to swallow. 

This is also a visually breathtaking and riveting show. Wonderful colors, compositions, cinematography, etc. There is some CGI, but it never takes center stage. BSG is not built around special effects. 

It's also a "serious" show, and by no means an escapist one. If you want some swashbuckling adventure in your Sci-Fi, see "Firefly" (a show that otherwise assumes that humans in space are still humans). 

That's about it. Well-acted, well-written, largely plausible (with occasionally eye-brow raisers), mature, character-driven. Flawed but redeemable characters, lots of different story arcs that span several episodes. Action takes a back seat (whole episodes go by without so much as a weapon drawn or a punch thrown). If you're intrigued by this desription, this show will fascinate and absorb you. The second season is even better.

I like the Linux OS on the machine, I just wish it wasn't so locked down so I couldn't use a few of my favorite programs.  There didn't seem to be an easy way to add applications, I guess they assumed you would settle for what was on the machine.  I wanted to add VLC, because it handles mutlple file formats, even Disk images.  On the web I ran into Flash video problems because this version of Linux isn't compatible with Flash 10. That is if you could even figure out how to install it.  The tech heads on the EEE PC message boards couldn't and said you had to settle for version 9.  This makes a lot of web applications and movie trailers inaccessible.  I also ran into a problem where I had to keep entering the Wep Key to access my secure router.  I eventually figured out how to make it stick, but it should have just remembered it the first time it asked for it.  It also can not see other computers on my network.  I store most of my media files on several computers in my network. I shared the DOC directory of the EEE PC and my machines see it and can write to it so whats the deal? I like the desktop and feel of this machine and if they put out an update that would fix this stuff I'd reinstall it in a second.
 I gave it a shot, but thats it. Spend the xtra 20-30 dollars and get the XP version.  It's a lot easier and cheaper when you consider that you have to buy a copy of windows and an external drive to install it.

I really like this drive. It has a nice rubber enclosure and a retractable USB connector. I've copied many large files with it now and here are my average transfer rates:

writing: 9mb/s
reading: 20mb/s

CONCERNS: a little on the small side could make it easy to lose, I hope the retractable connector doesn't break or wear out since it is plastic, no LED data light

LIKES: small, rubber encasing seems like it could take some drops, transfer speeds are good for 4gb, who would have though 4gb could be so cheap!!!

I had two previous automatic drinking fountains..I have cats and they , especially the older ones, benefit from increased water intake. The platinum fountain reservoir design works because one of my younger cats  would actually rock the earlier versions off the base and I would come home to a flooded kitchen floor! This keeps the water cool and fresh and my cats empty it on a regular basis.
The only drawback is that cat hair does collect and clog the unit so it is necessary to at least partially disassemble and clean it quite often and this can be a bit messy and difficult. And I did have to replace the plastic reservoir once because it fell over during the cleaning process and cracked. I suppose that glass would make it heavier but it would also make it more durable.
Still, overall, I would recommend this unit for pet owners who are concerned about their pet's fluid intake. This is especially important for older animals who tend to suffer decreased kidney function as they age.

I've been using this for a few years now - two cats, no fleas.
It's much better than flea bombing the house a few times per year. Apply once per month during flea season - If you wait more than 6 weeks, you'll get fleas.

This is a great netbook for anyone who wants to do some gaming on a small portable computer.  I'd have to say this is probably the best one to get if you're interested in playing any modern games that come out.  The 256mb dedicated graphics card can handle most of them fine on the default settings or even a little better.

I've currently installed Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, S4 League, and Jade Empires.  The first two run great without any problems.  Oblivion is using medium graphics as well as S4 League.  I have yet to try out Jade Empires.  
If you want to get a netbook that came play games, this is definitely it.  You don't want to try any of the later games that have come out on a shared video card, which is the only thing any other netbook has.

As for multi-tasking, I'm pretty heavy into it.  I usually run two-three different IM Programs, a browser with tabbed browsing (sometimes 7+ tabs open), word processor, music.  It does all those things great.  It realy slows down when you're transfering files as that eats up the already slow hard drive (5400 rpms).  I'd suggest anyone who wants a faster netbook to get a new hard with with at least 7200 rpms if not 10000.  Still the 320 gig hard drive you can't really beat.

The all in one media card reader is awesome, haven't used the hdmi port yet, at the battery life is great.  I'm used to an alienware that has 1 hour battery life (if that) and when you put it at max settings on battery even less.  This netbook I can play Oblivion or anything else for 3+ hours, which is awesome.  If you turn it on integrated and wi-fi off you get a little over 6 hours.  The standard 6 cell is great.  While overall less battery life than other netbooks, it more than makes up for it with superior performance.

There's nothing I've really done in Vista that would warrant changing it to XP, everything runs great.  I would suggest if you want to make this the best possible, get a faster hard drive (7200), a 4 gig SD card for readyboost, and set the battery to  high performance, which automatically overclocks it.  With the last two you definitely get 3+ hours of gameplay.

I bought this computer in hopes of reading ebooks, writing, programming, surfing the web, IMing, and some gaming.  Even if gaming isn't the highest priority, it's definitely a good thing to be able to do on long trips.

We used this every single night with our son and even bought the next size up when he outgrew the small size. He was sleeping through the night almost immediately. Part of that was because he was so comfy when swaddled. We used this for four months until he learned to flip to his belly and needed his arms free. A def must have for every baby!

I recently bought a box of Pampers for my elderly great-uncle, who is incarcerated at the local old-age home. Not only are they comfortable, he says, but he can walk quite fast with them on and he adores the little Sesame Street characters. Easy to use, easy to clean up. Although the fit is a bit tight, there have been no rashes thus far.  

Now if only he'd sit still when they dole out the apple sauce! 

Since great-uncle Horace was so pleased with them, I bought some Pampers for my kids and they LOVED them! In fact, they looked so happy wearing them that I decided to wear one to work. 
 
A few people around the office commented on my slightly inflated rear, but it didn't bother me in the least. Pampers are much more comfortable and functional than regular underwear. And the best part is, I didn't have to get up every time I needed to relieve myself!
 
I can't wait to go to work tomorrow!

The SanDisk Fuze is a great MP3 player.  The 2GB Fuze costs half the price of an iPod and has many more features and is easier to use.  The Fuze has a micro-SD slot so it's expandable for more music, videos, pictures, etc.  The Fuze has a digital FM radio so you can catch up on news, sports scores, and listen to radio music as well.  The Fuze also has a voice recorder with built-in microphone so you just talk into the machine and verbally record memos.  But the best feature...and this is what sold me on the Fuze... is that works with the ubiquitous Windows Media software found on most PCs.  You simply click and drag your music from your computer's library into the Fuze file, which I find much easier than Apple's complex and propriety music file system. The iPod is an icon, and there are a zillion accessories for it, but it doesn't hold a candle to the SanDisk Fuze.  Don't be a robot and follow the crowd, break yourself free and go for the Fuze.  SanDisk simply makes a better MP3 player with more features for a lot less money.  Whether its the very tiny Sansa Clip with 3-line display, or the Sansa Fuze with a full screen, SanDisk MP3 players are a much better value. I am very happy with my Fuze and highly recommend it.

Just a short review...

I just returned from the laundromat, where I left my 512MB Cruzer Titanium in a pair of pants. They went through the wash and I became aware of this when the Cruzer fell out of the pants in the dryer, making a hellacious racket in the process. 

I pretty much figured that 2 years worth of menus and plate photos went down the drain; I'm a chef. When I got home, just on a whim, I hooked up the Cruzer, and it promptly lit up and it's icon flashed up on my desktop. The data was there, and unharmed. 

Needless to say, I'm pretty damn impressed with my Cruzer. I'm in the process of buying a 4 gig Cruzer Titanium. I think the Cruzer did more damage to the dryer...

It is of considerable (psychological) interest to me how broadly distributed across the spectrum reactions to this season have been. Here is my reaction, for what it is worth.

This is the best season of BSG so far. Individual shows suffer from individual weaknesses, but as a whole *I* was unable to "put it down." 
(1) "I" -- this is my more or less subjective opinion, and,
(2) It is a DVD and not a book ...

One of the strengths of the season was that the sexual violence was diminished while the psychological dysphasia was amplified. Character development was given some *SERIOUS* attention. And for all of his flaws -- in more than a few instances, because of them -- Colonel Tigh is something of a personal hero to me. After spending much of season 3 delaminating, he gets one of the best lines of the series in the final episode of this season. Of course, noble sentiment can often be a setup to an even greater fall -- this is BSG.

As noted, a few individual episodes were not as strong as others. But my biggest complaint against the *season* is that the writers/directors once again chose to end on a cliff-hanger. This seems rather sophmoric  on their parts; they evidently do not trust their audience to return after the break to see the 4th (and evidently final) season. 

The DVD's are still worth owning. The stories are good and many of them are exceptional; while the acting, camera work, lighting and sets are consistently rich in that BSG sort of way.

I just got this book yesterday.  My kids and I have thoroughly enjoyed it! It is a simple, fun-to-read book that accepts the reality that people *will* eat at McDonalds and will have turkey for Thanksgiving. (If you eat Tofurkey, this is not your book!) 

You need to realize that this book will not show you the best possible foods you could eat out of all foods that exist. The premise behind the book is that IF you are already going to Applebees for lunch, how can you do the least damage? Many Applebees items are more than 1,000 calories! If you know that, and choose to eat it anyway, then so be it, but some people would rather choose a better item, one with 360 calories. That is the idea behind the book.  I think this is marvelously realistic. If I go to McDonalds, I am certain I'm not going to a health-food-store, however, what menu item would be the *least* destructive?

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because sometimes I can't tell why one food made the "Yes" list when another made the "No" list. For example, there are Lean Cuisine meals on both. One may be lower in fat, but higher in sodium. Another may have more fat, but fewer calories. I'm not certain what made them say Yes to one and No to the other. Another issue is that individuals may have certain health criteria that the author didn't consider in the "Yes" list. I don't eat Aspertame, so I won't eat yogurt that contains it, no matter how the numbers look.  However, they can't consider every single factor and the aim of the book is to make it simple to choose the better item.  In that vein, the book is outstanding.  It earns a spot in my car, so I can check before running into any restaurant or fast food vendor. The book is a real eye-opener and has already impressed me with certain foods I doubt I will ever eat again. (Cinnabon, for example.) It's not worth the hours and hours I will have to ride my bike to burn it off!

I bought these sheets thinking they would be a lighter sage green as shown in the pictures, but they're actually a BRIGHT pea green... not horrible, but a little more "Emerald City" than I was hoping for.  :-)  

They are quite large... we put the fitted sheet over our deep pillowtop mattress AND a featherbed--- and it's still kinda loose.   But the fabric is thick and seems fairly durable.  We haven't washed them yet, but I'm kinda hoping they shrink a bit b/c the top of my bed looks a little too "billowy" for my preferences...

Bought the Chefs Choice 610 food slicer, then saw the Waring FS150 (similar but a Professional model with larger motor) for $30 less an hour later.  Bought that one also with intent to look up reviews online and decide at home.  After reading reviews (great reviews for Chefs Choice, awful reviews for the Waring) and instruction manuals on both (still can't believe you can't run the Waring for more than 10 minutes at a time and the poor design for cleanup) decided to keep the Chefs Choice.  Used it to slice roast beef, swiss cheese and baked turkey breast.  Worked extremely well on all and the unit is extremely easy to use.  Cleanup took about 5 minutes total.  Unit is a little larger than I would have liked, but all the food slicers have similar dimensions. Well worth the extra $30.

I bought the first bread maker from National/Panasonic in 1986 when I lived in Japan and I thought it was the best thing ever invented for the kitchen. This model is so much better now that it has updated functions and bakes a larger loaf (2.5lbs). 

The bread comes out perfect every time, as long as you follow the direction carefully. I recommend weighing ingredients (as the supplied directions also recommend) as the recipes are not scaled to be very friendly (.."4 and 5/16 cup of bread flour"). It comes out much better.

The best part of this bread maker is the aroma! The smell of freshly baked bread is worth getting up in the morning.

I bought this simply to add storage to my Moxi DVR.

As soon as the Moxi upgraded to the latest software I hooked up the drive and the Moxi detected it and reformated it. after about 5 minutes the drive was correctly reported in the available storage screen and has been working fine ever since.

It does not seem hot or under any stress from being on 24/7. 

One of the reasons this drive was chosen is that it does NOT have a sleep mode that the Moxi cannot deal with.

This comes stock with the iPhone 3G, phone charges really fast.  The only reason I docked a star is the prongs don't fold down.

A few things to note:

1)  Why is this $35 on Amazon, and only $30 from Apple?  More so, why is a freaking power adapter $30!!!   Part of the answer might be...

2)  Beware of after-market (used/ebay/etc) power adapters.   There was a recall on these back in September.   The new (replacement) ones have a small green dot on the side with the prongs.   You can't just buy a cheapo off ebay and take it in for an exchange, because Apple requires the serial # from the phone.  

3)  Older dock chargers and wall warts don't work on the iPhone 3G (they changed the pin config around for the iPhone 3G) but I used my older iPOD USB cables and this wall wart adapter and the phone charged just fine.

I know, I know... I'm just as sad as the rest of the world that has fallen madly in love with Stephenie Meyer's Saga. Why have I fallen so head over heels?? The book is written so simplistically that you can tell it was written for younger adults.  There are holes in the plot lines and the ending of the books, as well as character composition, BUT what saves these books is her ability to capture "the teenage" years and raw emotion. It is this that makes this book more REALISTIC.

I hungrily read through these books in 3 1/2 days. I was totally and utterly captivated- awe struck. I am now reading them again and enjoying them just the same but with a greater sense of anticipation as I get to re-encounter Edward and his family and watch Bella slightly mature and develop.

Meyer captures the all to unpleasant and intoxicating emotions of being a teenager discovering things for the first time. Bella's encounters with Edward made me remember back to the days of smelling hair to make sure I smelled good or feeling the butterflies when I would see my husband (YES, we are high school sweethearts. Married 7 years now) and all the emotions I would feel when he leaned in to kiss me.  She makes you feel what Bella feels. She makes you feel the angst and the desire she has for Edward, the fear for her child, the love... she makes you feel the unexplainable feelings that Edward goes through to keep from "eating" Bella, his frustration when he can't be with her.

I think too, people are so captivated by these books because of the  deep desire to belong runs that through them- something everyone relates too. This and the need to find someone that you need, love, and want to protect at all costs and to have those things returned- finding your "soul mate".  This coupled with the idea of eternal life ... what can be said. If we all were able to find our soul mates and know that we have the rest ALL time to be with that person (religion aside here folks), what would we give up? If there were no repercussions, not damnation? Or to know that you could keep your child with you that long and KNOW that no harm would come to them? The thought is utterly intoxicating.

Aside from the wonderful realistic characteristics she has given her book, Meyer has been criticized for entangling one to many mythical creatures in one set of stories.  My thoughts on this: IT'S FICTION, she can do WHATEVER she wants. Is or rather was that not the reason people love to read? We read and watch movies so that we can escape the confines of everyday life.  So, she put a werewolf (which is not really a werewolf but shape-shifters and if any one knew anything about Native lore, they would know that shape-shifters are VERY common. ) and a vampire *Swoons over Edward* together. BIG deal! Witches and vampires have been mixed, werewolves and vamps, etc... COME ON the combinations that have already been put together are so numerous that its ridiculous to criticize  someone for fiction. UNLESS its bad fiction,  then they need to learn from their critiques.

We'll have to see if the movie proves to be as good as the book. I LOVE the cast... well most of them. I think they created a pretty good cast. Edward and Bella's characters were cast perfectly! The only complaint is for Esme's character and this may not be a valid complaint as I can't really remember what kind of description was given for her but her character seems to be a little older than she is supposed to be??

Oral irrigators like this give your mouth a clean feeling, and your dentist will smile upon you as well (they do a good job of getting rid of gunk between the teeth and at the gumline that would otherwise turn into tartar).  This unit is compact and fits together well. The motor nests into the water tank when not in use, and a quick tug is all you need to pull it out. It's easy to hold and well designed. The only flaw is that you'll need to refill the water tank during use, because it doesn't really hold enough to go over your entire mouth (it's not 20 minutes worth of water as the editorial review says above - more like 40 seconds), but this is simple - flip open a little piece of plastic and run water into the hole, then flip it closed and continue.

I've been wanting to jump on the netbook bandwagon since the release of the original EEE PC (I guess about a year ago.). After the last couple of months of researching and bugging my wife, I decided to go with the new Aspire One once I saw that it shipped.
I got the unit with the 160 GB HDD with XP Home, and to be honest, this is the best little computer that I've ever owned. With a few exceptions, I am entirely and completely pleased.
The keyboard and screen size were obviously my biggest worry. I'm a college student, and got this almost entirely for its portability. The bezel around the screen is a little larger than I'd like (I wish they'd have put a 10" screen in - it's almost big enough). However, the screen itself is VERY bright, to the point where it makes my old laptop look just plain dark. The keyboard is not *too* small, and I was able to type several pages of an essay on it with a couple hours' practice. In fact, this review is being written on my One.
One nitpick is the fan. Like most people have said, the fan is a *little* loud, but I almost never notice it. I'd rather it be on than for my laptop to get hot enough to burn me.
The laptop itself is very snappy, speed-wise. I was able to import, move around, and play with my iTunes library with very little hesitation. It seems almost as fast as my previous laptop, which was a big, HOT dual-core Gateway I got 2.5 years ago. 
The side-mounted mouse buttons take some getting used to, but the biggest nitpick I have with the One is that the side of the trackpad normally used for scrolling seems like it doesn't want to.. scroll. It's very tough to get it to work, but I've just taken to using the arrow keys.I'm probably just missing a setting somewhere.

I very highly recommend this to anyone looking for a netbook,or even a new notebook.

ENTERTAINMENT!  I was dragged to this movie by my girlfriend who always attends the guy films and so I went to see this "chick flick", which was my understanding. I think this was a true love story and one of possibilities, one of hope. I saw this movie and was entertained. I give this movie 5 stars and truly understand why it won 8 Academy Awards, it didn't have that Hollywood feeling. Even though the whole story was fake, it made me wish that at least some parts were real and isn't that what movies are supposed to do?

My Aussie shephard/border collie mix is a hyper but shy guy.  He's about 70 lbs. and this is the perfect size to push around inside the house.  I now give all his feeds in this ball.  He sniffles and wags his tail the entire time he eats. Occupies him for about 45 minutes...It's one of his happiest times of the day (the other is the treadmill).  The worst part is trying to find it before the morning feed so I have taken to finding it the night before.  An animal behaviorist told me that it promotes self thinking and build confidence in obedient, but shy dogs. I don't know if that's true, but I know my guy absolutely loves this ball.

I have always used Conair or Revlon flat irons before, and don't get me wrong, they work well for the price. I had just gone through my second Conair which lasted about 2-3 years. The finish was coming off and my stylist suggested a Chi...
First: This price is really good!! Get it!
I was surprised when I got the Chi that it only had "on" and "off." All my others had had temperature settings. But don't be fooled, you don't need a temperature setting for this thing-- it HEATS UP!!! I have fine straight hair, but use a flat iron to make the ends flip and lay the way I want them too. It does an excellent job and very quickly. Heats up quick and I am done with straightening in about 2 minutes with this lovely little tool. Well worth the extra money, just be careful as I have had friends who have dropped it and the plate broke. I keep mine propped open on a basket to make sure it doesn't get easily knocked off the counter.

I've been a huge fan of Razer's gaming mice for a while now (they are far more sensitive than any other mouse that I've tried and fit my hand perfectly.) but while Razer's laser technology is second to none, their hardware tends to not hold up as well to constant wear and tear. I've owned two Diamondbacks and a Copperhead, and all three developed hardware issues in a relatively short period of time (with a year of purchase)
When I read that Microsoft and Razer had a joint venture in the Habu, I figured it'd be worth a try. So far it appears to be a solid combination.

The mouse is slightly larger than either the Diamondback or Copperhead. The buttons so far feel sturdier than Razer's typical mice. The cable appears to be sturdier as well. The sensitivity is easily on par with the Diamondback. I'd say it's marginally less sensitive than the Copperhead, but unless you're a hardcore FPS gamer, I'd say the difference is minimal. Rather than having two buttons on either side of the mouse, the thumb-side has two buttons, with the two additional buttons being placed in an indent directly behind the scroll wheel. The thumbside buttons come on a removable plate and can be replaced with larger buttons (this second plate is included, as are extra rubber feet for the bottom of the mouse)

I downloaded the latest software and firmware directly from Razer's website, and had absolutely no problems with installation or use on Windows XP. Only time will tell if the mouse holds up to wear and tear, but I have high hopes.

Works well as additional storage.  Have not used the Ceedo feature so can't comment on that.  Formatted capacity is 149GB; only about 118 MB are taken up by the Ceedo application so very little impact if you leave it on the drive.  Can be removed if you don't want to use it.  Drive is formatted in NTFS but can be reformatted FAT32 for use with Linux or Mac systems.  The following case holds the drive and the cable: Small External HD Case Black.  It is a snug fit but very secure and no wasted space.  Reliability concerns over the WD Passport line led me in this direction and it seems like a good choice so far.  Includes special cable to draw power from two laptop USB ports.  I found that if I used only one I received power surge warnings from the USB port.  Worked best when I plugged both laptop ends of the cable into the computer before plugging the other end into the hard drive.

Just as many who have written before me, I deliciously enjoyed the final book to the Twilight saga.  As greatly anticipated, I was not let down by the wedding or honeymoon in the beginning of the book, nor the unexpected portions to follow.  

I was slightly taken aback by some of the more adult themes of the book particularly Bella's pregnancy.  However, I do feel everything in the book was very fitting for the next step in the character's lives.  
*During one interview, Stephanie Meyer did in fact state that she thought an age advisory should be placed on the books, and after reading them, I think that the publisher's should have taken that suggestion.   

Many other reviews have dinged Meyer for the characters changing to much and the relationship between Bella and Edward changing.  However, I believe that is a true tribute to the characters and the relationships they each represent. As we all go through major life events we are going to change and evolve, so why wouldn't these characters? As a newlywed in my mid twenties, I could relate to a lot of these changes.  Additionally as someone who has debated whether or not to have children, this book has placed a new perspective on life and family.  Therefore, I am happy that Stephanie Meyer included all of these unexpected life events and plot twists.  

If I were to give one criticism it would be that the story conclusion was rather "neat".  I agree that I wanted all of the loose ends to be tied, including Jacob imprinting on someone. However, I was disappointed that there was not more life loss, that the overall sacrifice was not greater. 

With all of these thoughts in mind, I was very please with the storyline conclusions, the way the book was broken up by perspectives, and the overall writing.

Been using this since 2 weeks.
This is a good buy for the price it comes.
The bass kicks good, but the trebel is lacking quite a bit.
Mic is good and chatting is enjoyable.
All in all a good product to buy.
I recommend it.

One down side is that it hurts after a certain usage time and u need to keep moving it to avoid hurting... I'm more in pain since I use glasses.

Jonathon Rhys Myers is still captivating in Season 2. Where season 1 had lots of love and intimacy, this season is far more political and bloody with most of the original cast of season 1 losing their heads. Peter O'Toole is very good as the Pope but he seams to be there just for his star power rather than what he contributes to the storylines. A pity that many of the actors from season 1 were written out of season 2.

Extra features is very disappointing- full of promotion for other Showtime programs. I wanted more information behind the scenes about how the series was made eg costumes- recreating the world of Henry VIII with sets.

I hope season 3 is just as lavish and enticing as now Jane Seymor will be the leading female character.

When you're looking for the latest in style, comfort, and innovation look no further than here. Saitek's Eclipse II is a great deal for anyone interested in a fun, new keyboard. You get to choose from 3 back-lit keyboard settings; Purple, Blue, Red, [Off]. I enjoyed this feature enough to buy this keyboard for that reason, the lighting is not too bright and even if it is you can dim it with the easy to use dialer. It also features a Start, Stop, Pause, Forward, and Back button for your music and also has volume control.

Overall the typing on this keyboard is flawless and quiet. You will notice they are a bit slippery at first to type on, there's no real grip to the keys like older keyboards usually tend to get. It takes time to get used to but once you do you'll be happy with your purchase completely. This keyboard is worth every penny. Great product with awesome features.

I have a 9 year old who has been creating movies with our 8mm camera.  However, we've struggled to find conversion software that works, so having the recorded media ready to upload to YouTube or converted to another editiing software program has proven very successful for us.

I couldn't have imagined how easy this camera and the software is to use.  It's not a professional video camera, but it does an overall fantastic job of recording.

My son is very happy with this camera, and the best part is he can manage the uploading, saving, and even creation of movies using the Flip editing/movie maker software included.

The zune is better.  Unfortunately, because the Ipod is so famous, the zune will need to do another leapfrog before it gets noticed.  Simply put, the zune is capable of doing everything the Nano can do, but better.  The Zune is networked.  The Zune is compatible with Rhasody's TO Go feature, which makes Zune capable of playing any song you want.  Plus Zune has Wi-Fi built in.  The Zune is superior.  

That said, the Ipod has some distinct features that make it still a good player.  The Ipod has the accelerometer, and cover flow.  Zune doesn't have that.  So if those features are important to you, stick with the ipod.

This is an awesome little drive!

I purchased it to create full backups of my iMac (OS X 10.5.5) that I can store in my safe deposit box, and I haven't been disappointed.  It comes pre-formatted for OS X, so you can just plug it in and go (OS X recognizes it immediately after plugging it in via USB).  I chose to reformat with Leopard just to ensure that any file system changes under Leopard were taken into account, and the reformatting process took all of 30 seconds, no problems.  It provided great performance with about 260GB being backed up over USB in about 4 hours and, in the event of an emergency, allows you to boot your iMac directly off the drive (using Firewire).

It is physically small (about the size of a small pocket hooch flask), is well constructed and feels very solid and durable in your hand, and is dead quiet when operating.

I am thrilled with this purchase and with Iomega's excellent support for Macs and I'll be back for more!

After purchasing and trying several other pedometers, I purchased the Omron for myself. I absolutely love this product. First, it is accurate, the most accurate I have used so far, and beyond tracking only my steps, it will switch to tracking aerobic steps on its own, so I can get an idea about how many of the steps I take in a day actually are doing some good!
I like having the clock feature and the 7 day tracking of progress as well. You literally can put this on almost anywhere on your body and it will still accurately track results.

It is a bit bigger than other products, but if you can get past that, I think anyone would love one of these. The safety clip is a plus too.
I also appreciate that this doesn't "tick" when walking, it's not a pendulum based pedometer so it's not rocking and clicking.

I've decided to use this machine as both a travel PC and a home/graduate school PC. By attaching a 19" wide screen monitor, keyboard, and mouse, I've got the best of both worlds; a well running workstation and a light netbook for when I'm on the go.

I received the blood pressure item in quick time, well wrapped.  I was pleased.
I learned how to use the Monitor over a course of a few days, with instructions included and additional instructions via the internet.
My only disappointment was that the unit will not allow me to use my Mac computer to upload and record the data; it seems it's only set up for a Windows operating system.  Had I been aware of that I would not have ordered this deluxe item with the computer features  and would have gotten the simple, cheaper one instead.
Otherwise, it is well made.  I am surprised that when taking blood pressure readings not one of them is the same as the one before and you have to take a series of readings and determine what range your readings are in: safe, beginning hi or low, and high (or low) and rate your level from that..

It is a good product, people here don't know how to review something, and are making up things.  The keypad it bigger than a pack of cigarettes, much bigger and just as thick.  It is low profile so it would be nice for it to be even thinner.  The mouse is so small, takes what 15 minutes to get used to.  It has scrolling function, laser pointer is a huge plus.  The setup it pretty easy put batteries in, plug usb wait for it to automatically install because it is plug and play.  Then hold down the button the usb part and the mouse at the same time and do the same thing for the keypad, very easy.  But people can't seem to figure that out.  And that is a exaggeration that is can't go a foot away.  I went six feet away without problems, who would really need to go further than foot anways.  It says on the package mouse for laptop, doesn't say desktop.  But it comes with a usb extension anyways.

I'm a guy, and all I can say is I love these sheets. The 600 thread count makes them heavy and luxurious, and my girlfriend likes them too. The "sateen" label is a little misleading because some people think it implies the sheets will feel silky, but they're really just good 'ol fashioned heavy cotton, which we love. I bought two sets mainly to get 4 pillowcases, and although my girlfriend says she knew this was going to happen, I didn't and was a little bummed when both sets arrived and it was clear that each had been put together from different bolts of fabric so the colors were slightly off. But again, being a guy I was "over it" in about 400 milliseconds. And to be fair, nothing on the site ever said that if I ordered more than one set they would both be EXACTLY the same hue. All-in-all, a GREAT deal especially with FREE SUPER-SAVER shipping.

I am a new mom and I keep a blog for my son that my family members all around the country check on.  It's our way of staying close even when we are on the west coast and most of the family is on the east coast.

I looked and looked for a simple, straightforward camcorder type item that would work seamlessly with my computer so that I could easily upload video onto the blog.  After hours reading Consumer Reports and visiting annoying stores like Circuit City, my friend and fellow Mom/blogger told me about the Clip camera.  It is EXACTLY what I was looking for and cheaper than all the camcorders I had been researching!

What I like most is the following: (1) small size (fits in diaper bag), (2) incredibly easy interface for video upload and editing, perfect for technophobes like me, (3) seems to work nicely without installing all kinds of annoying software on my computer (which can't accept any more software because it is full of photos and video files!)  It also charges via its connection to the computer which is excellent since we all know that batteries die at the least opportune times and also are a pain to replace.

It is also pretty cool, which is nice, as I try to appear cool at times.

This new model has an especially nice control dial that is an improvement on the earlier models.  It does seem a bit sensitive/reactive but I am sure I will get the hang of it soon.

As far as I can tell, the video quality is excellent, beyond what I would have ever expected from such a petite and economical device.  Even the sound is great - nice and clear.  

So - five stars, and great enthusiasm for this little camera.

One of the things that fascinate me about the story is the romance.  I think it speaks to certain individuals in a special way that allows them to dream/fantasy, or in the mature reader's mind (I am 40) remember when they experienced that first passionate love affair.  I stumbled onto the book series after reading in a mag that Pattinson was cast as Edward (I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and always loved how he portrayed Cedric. Besides his acting, I am also drawn to his music, he is quite talented. I play piano & guitar - so I guess I am biased).  I read the first 3 books in 1 week.  Couldn't wait until the 4th and the movie.  I was already infatuated with the paranormal - Vampire-related (Anne Rice books & movies, Bram Stoker, Stephen King, 30 days of Night, Dracula 2000, Sookie Stackhouse & HBO True Blood, Laurel K. Hamilton, Christine Feehan, Blood+ etc.) and Alien-related (Roswell - EXCELLENT SERIES!!), so it's no wonder that I too have become among the obsessed.  I have seen the movie 3 times in the theater (each time, turning more people on to the story), preordered the DVD, as well as the sheet music to the SCORE...

I really, really liked the original Flip Video Mino camcorder.  It's sleek, small design, ease of use and handsome presentation made it a perfect gift for that special occasion.  Now I've had some hands on experience with the Flip Video MinoHD Camcorder and urge this as excellent little stocking stuffer.  In fact, this would be the perfect gift to open the night before Christmas to catch those great moments connected to playing Santa-- the ones involving parts that don't fit together and packaging that it would take a blow torch to cut open and Santa losing his cool.  Those special memories.

While it holds about 60 minutes of video on the built-in 4 gig of memory-- if I had to change anything about this camera I would add an option to slot in a memory card--you won't be shooting War and Peace with it.  There's more than enough memory to shoot some great moments here, video to send to friends and loved ones who can't be sharing Christmas this year, a video Holiday card to be uploaded to email or shared on Youtube.  

The video playback screen is sharp and crisp.  It comes with a television connector but the real friend of the Fip Video MinoHD is the computer.  Plug it up with the build in USB adapter to charge it.  It also has built in software that aids you in sharing and saving your video.  It's very easy for even the inexperienced to use this intuitive camcorder.

This camera has great image quality, and was a great buy. But one thing that frustrated me (before buying) was that I couldn't find much info about the more advanced specs.

But luckily, I have done the homework for you ;)
Here are some things you might want to know:


-The CMOS is 5MP native (resolution: 2592 x 1944)
don't bother with the 8MP it just 'blows up' the image (interpolation)

-The lens, even though the image quality is excellent, is the weak point of this camera. Its a fixed focus without any optical zoom. Theres only digital zoom which decreases the quality the farther its zoomed in, but not too badly.

The 2 focus modes,
Normal: Autofocuses from 30cm to infinity. Best for general purpose video recording. Nothing is really out of focus unless its too close to the camera. Though it can be slow at times.
Macro: For close-ups. Objects/people look alot clearer/better when focused on than with the normal focus mode, and everything in the background is blurred. But theres no focusing with this setting so you have to be sure the camera is the perfect distance away from the object so that its in focus.
On the camera, the top setting with the mountain/stick figure is normal focus mode and the lower setting with the flower shape is macro. There are also wide angle lenses available that fit this camera.

-The battery
Battery life for me is very good, but depends on your recording mode, screen brightness etc. Make sure to charge it for awhile when you first get it. Also sometimes the light seems to change randomly to show that its charged when its still charging. Theres a defect where the battery is loose inside and rattles around/loses contact with the terminals that make it turn off. Just improvise and put a piece of paper/cardboard below the battery to keep it from being loose.

-The screen is good quality, a little hard to see in bright daylight. No dead pixels.

-The mic is okay for me, but it tends to record the person behind the camera rather than whats in front.

-Records from AV-IN at 720 x 480 NTSC 29.97FPS
the quality is decent when I record from a satellite receiver [I always record pay-per-view ;)]. When played back on SDTV it looks nearly exactly as the original broadcast besides for some static at the very top of the screen. Audio quality is 5/5 with no hissing. Format: H264 @ 2.12mbits/sec Audio: AAC stereo 48.000khz BTW you can't do composite-in.

-has TV-OUT with AV-out and Composite-out
You can do everything with TV-out activated that you can do normally, even record vids/take pics/change settings. Video and picture quality is terrific, and they load instantly too. You can also zoom in pan around on photos, and of course fast forward/rewind/pause with videos. You can also zoom in on a paused video.

-works with my sandisk 4gb Ultra II SDHC memory card
make sure your memory card is 'high speed' or else it probably can't write data fast enough to keep up with the higher quality recording modes. I believe the memory limit is 32gb.

-recording modes:
1080p: 29.97FPS Data rate: 7.58mbits/sec at 1920x1080
720p 60f: 59.94FPS Data rate: 6.04mbits/sec at 1280x720
720p 30f: 29.97FPS Data rate: 4.10mbits/sec at 1280x720
'DVD quality': 59.94FPS Data rate: 3.57mbits/sec at 854x480
'CIF': 29.97FPS Data rate: 750.86kbits/sec at 320x240
All except 'CIF' are 16:9 aspect ratio (widescreen)
Image quality is a bit grainy if the room is dark, though you can adjust white balance/exposure settings to fix this. I would say the best overall setting is 720p 60FPS. Theres no stabilization but its really stupid to complain that the footage is 'shaky' when all you have to do is hold your arm more steady/hold it with 2 hands. After all the camera captures exactly what it sees. You can also use a tripod.

-tips for playback
The version of quicktime included on the CD is an old version that plays choppy on even the fastest computer. The best way to play back your vids in my opinion is to first:
1. Rename the file from .MOV to .HDMOV
2. Play the file with Windows Media Player
doing it this way uses the graphics card (GPU) to help play the video, instead of just the CPU which isn't very good at it. Doing it this way with my E2140 core2duo and 256mb graphics card, a 1080p video used just around 40-55% CPU. If you get an error about codecs, look up on google 'k-lite codec pack'.


 Now the biggest problem everyone has is that the format of the videos (.MOV) is incompatible/doesn't work right with alot of editing software. Most people convert the video to another format which decreases the quality and takes forever. Are you ready for a simple solution that will prevent you hours of frustration?

The actual video captured is encoded to H.264 codec with AAC audio, the .MOV is just a container file. AVI, MP4, MKV and lots of others can hold H.264 video. So all you have to do is...

Rename FILE.MOV to FILE.MP4


easy as that...now the file should work in sony vegas and any other editing software that supports H264, and also play back fine with supporting media players.

I tried 4 different pod machines and found the coffee to run the gamut from weak to strong and bitter-UNTIL I found the Keurig!  We have 2 homes and one in each place. We find everyone can enjoy a coffee they like in the K-cups from Keurig -from chai tea, all kinds of flavored varieties of coffee, as well as dark and rich coffee, cocoa, and now they even have a little cup in which you can put your own coffee. Easy to use, to clean, and maintain. We especially like Green Mountain Coffee and Bigelow teas, all of which are available at keurig.com. Coffee can be programmed for monthly arrivals or whenever you want to order it, and it arrives quickly. A great fresh cup of coffee-in different sizes.

Battlestar Galactica - Season 4.0

You really need to see watch this season for continuation of the narrative and the search for Earth. 
 But many of the episodes really, I feel, had characters wildly diverting from their former personas. That is why I wasn't crazy about this season.

Starbuck and Gaius, particularly, seemed liked they had undergone major personality changes. Starbuck becomes whiny naggy obsessive "seer" of Earth, she can't prove what she knows she justs "feels " it in her inner being/psyche.  Starbuck had never come across as a touch/feely type of character.

This is similiar to the religious conversion that Gaius undergoes, but his is for completely different reasons. I just don't buy it, but maybe I am not supposed to.
The change in Felix Gaeta which begins in 4.0 and carries on to 4.5 does make absolute sense, however.  
By the end of this group of DVD's, Starbuck is back to her usual aggressive pilot jock self, and there are glimpses of the smarmy semi-fraudulent horn dog that is Gaius's true self.   So all is well.

WATCH THE WEBISODE, if you have not already, about Felix and the 8's trip for some R & R. It is on [...]battlestar. It explains a great deal more about Felix.

I bought this camera about a month ago and have been taking videos with it at local New Orleans parades, events, concerts etc, and it rocks! Its a little chunkier than the competition but when you can replace batteries and memory on the go and take the shots you need it really shines. The video quality is fine, its not HD but instead looks like 1990s era home movies. I have dropped this thing multiple times and its not even scratched (knock on wood) and I love it. Someone told me when they saw it "wow you have a huge phone!" but for the most part all my friends think its awesome, especially the part about being able to swap in memory and fresh batteries.  I travel outside the country alot and having a camera that requires hooking up to a computer all the time like the flip and others just doesn't work for me. If you get off the beaten path your going to want to take more pictures of cool and wild things, not less. It also has a solid feel, its got some substance to it but still discreet enough that I can pull it out and film without people really noticing (its all about how you hold it). I am now working on making some video montages to music but haven't messed with the software that comes on it yet, so no review on that. I have a SD card reader and just take the card out to transfer videos compared to the built in USB it came with. It isn't shiny or sexy and if thats your thing look elsewhere.

I highly recommend this keyboard for all gamers and just computer users in general. It has lasted me quite a while now and it still lights up well. There's only one problem with it, however, but this may just be this particular keyboard. At times (not often, maybe two-three times before), the USB cable would stop working and the keys wouldn't work at all. The power is on because the blue light is on, but I cannot type anything. This is the only issue I see with this product and I'm sure for many others, this problem wouldn't occur often at all.

The best part about this keyboard is the silence from typing. These keys are incredibly quiet, which is especially nice since I hate hearing keyboard 'clicking' sounds.

I have never done any type of yoga before today. I got my dvd in the mail and couldn't wait to try it out! It was really great! I was worried that yoga wouldn't give much of a workout...just a few minutes in and I was sweating and my muscles were burning! :o) Bob does a great job explaining everything and after just a few minutes I didn't even need to look at the tv much for explanation, just listen to Bob's instructions. I'm going to follow the 6wk plan to, hopefully, build up to lever 3. If I remember I'll come back and edit this and let you know how it went and how the weight loss went. 
But anyway, I would say if you are considering buying this dvd...do it! you won't be sorry!

This review is from: The Princess Bride (Special Edition) (DVD)

      



If you are looking for a slightly twisted, funny fairy tale, you've come to the right place.

The movie opens with a sick boy (Fred Savage).  His grandfather (Peter Falk) comes in and offers to read him a special story.  Only because it has sports in it does the grandson agree to hear the story.  But he is soon swept up into a magical story.  Fortunately, we get to go along for the ride.

In a land far away lived a beautiful girl named Buttercup (Robin Wright).  She enjoys tormenting the family servant Westley (Cary Elwes).  Soon, they fall in love, and Westley sets off to seek his fortune in the world, promising to return for her one day.

His ship, however, is attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, a man who takes no prisoners.

Three years pass, and Buttercup has agreed to marry Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) even though she doesn't love him.  On the day they announce their engagement, Buttercup is kidnapped by three evil men who intend to kill her.  However, they are being followed by a man in black.  Who is he?  Will he rescue her?  Is he even trying to rescue her?

This is one of those movies that requires two viewings.  I'll admit I didn't appreciate this movie the first time around.  The plot rambles all over the place, the scenes with the grandfather and grandson seem out of place, and the lines everyone quotes don't seem all that funny.

But on the second viewing, my opinion changed.  When I wasn't trying to figure out the plot, I saw the humor in the piece.  It's spoofing fairy tales.  As such, it is brilliant.  And the dialogue truly is funny if you give it a second chance.  Along the way, we get amazing sword fights, danger, and true love.  What more could you want?

Now while I say this is a spoof, it's a general spoof of fairy tales in general and none specifically.  And it still takes itself seriously enough that you come to care for these characters and what happens to them.

So this is my advice.  Watch the movie once, put it away for a while, and then try it again.  I think you'll find it works much better when you know exactly what to expect.

I have to confess that the brilliant advertising sucked me in on this one.  I saw an ad in Men's Health, the one with the two kiwis (one fuzzy and one smooth) and then found it here on Amazon. I've shared the great video clip with everyone I know!  I ordered it for my boyfriend, who is into trimming up his nether regions.  He hasn't used it yet, but I have, and I can attest to the fact that it works great for girls, too.  I had another "personal shaver" that was supposed to be made especially for girly parts, but it was too painful to use.  This one is awesome, and used correctly, inflicts no wounds. Great little tool for your personal grooming needs!

I've owned this drive for about five months at this writing, and use it to store all my video and music files (both mp3 and wav). And I still have 400GB of free space! 

Its USB 2.0 interface is fast enough for video playback in a RAID 0 configuration (since it's actually two 1TB drives it can also be set RAID 1 to automatically back up everything you put on it). 

It's a fairly small and very attractive package that doesn't get overly warm; if it has cooling fans inside I haven't heard them running yet. I much prefer its keyhole-shaped fluorescent-looking indicator light to the blinking bull's eye I've seen on older MyBook drives. Its up-and-down motion is actually kind of soothing. 

Opening the box to replace a drive, if necessary, doesn't look too difficult if you're so inclined. It's quiet but not totally silent -- there's a soft clattering sound when it's working but I don't find it annoying and it's totally masked by movie audio or music.  

One bit of advice, do NOT assume that Microsoft Vista's automatic "Defrag Lite" will do a good job on a drive this huge.  I started to experience playback problems with recorded video and discovered that the drive was severely fragmented, even with Vista set to defrag it once a week. There's no easy way to analyze the drive for fragmentation with Vista defrag's dumbed-down user interface. And it would be great if WD included a defrag utility in its Drive Manager or Diagnostics Tool -- it doesn't. But there's freeware out there (Auslogics or JKDefrag) that will do a thorough job and, even better, actually show you what it's doing. So defrag this drive thoroughly and often, especially if you copy, move, delete and convert a lot of large video files.

I not only own this machine, I now have 4!  My son was diagnosed with Crohns disease so he eats a lot of yogurt for the good bacteria it provides.  He eats sooo much I had to buy 4 machines and make 4 quarts every other day to keep up with him! Use a  mason jar rather than the plastic insert, it works much better.  We also make cream cheese from the yogurt. This machine is invaluable.  We let ours cook for 24 hours which removes any remaining lactose for those that can't tolerate store bought yogurt.

So I know it sounds crazy to say a tape measure is great, but this one really is.  I was using a regular ribbon-type tape measure (from a sewing kit) and this one blows that away!  It's very easy to use and gives consistent measurements, which is important when you're tracking body progress, which involves very small changes!  I recommend it if you're looking for a body tape measure, and it's reasonably priced.

Planning a short visit to SF in a few days, I thought I better get more familiar with some of the local history. The events told by this biopic happened rather far away from me, so that I knew little of its story from memory.

All in all, I would say, bigotry is far less widespread in Germany than in the US (the debates over gay marriage, that I could follow on CNN and also with American friends recently, were rather shocking. We have some major political leaders, who are openly gay, in Germany, and there is very little fuss about it), so the 'issue' is not so present in my political awareness.

It seems to me that the movie is a solid product which presents the problems and the story adequately, without idealisation or undue cosmetical surgery. It is not a full analysis of the development and its implications, nor a romantic fairy tale about a tragic hero.
Penn does a fantastic job. How good he is can be deduced from the video scenes of the real man at the end of the film. Penn must have watched nothing else for weeks until he could be exactly that man. Kudos.

I guess the real life fight for equal rights is continuing.

Works with Rhapsody To Go. This was the main reason why I purchased this model. Sound: pretty good, however not as good as players from Creative Labs. Screen: Not very ergonomic, but readable. I would like to adjust scrolling speed, but not possible. Equilizer: 5 standard settings + custom. Works pretty well. Tuner: Pretty sophisticated, with auto scan. Mirophone: available, but I haven't tested. Battery: standard alkaline AAA lasts for me about a week, NiMH 900 mAh lasts forever. Cons: a) looks ugly, b) battery cover loose and must be fastened with Scotch tape from day one. I checked other players owned by friends; all have the same problem. Summarizing: EXTREMELY good value for the monies assuming that you are not obliged to show up with most expensife, fashionable and up-to-date gear

A friend told me that he despised this film, found it slow and plodding and melodramatic; so I went into it cautiously. Not necessarily with no expectations, just knowing that it might be one I'd switch off after 1/2 an hour.  Well, I don't know if my friend and I saw the same film, but I was completely sucked into this.  I found the performances excellent (and I'm not particularly a fan of Jolie, but she is excellent) and the setting of time an place without fault.  Many times in period pieces, you get a presentation of style over storytelling, stilted dialog more fitting of noir than realism.  Here, the style and the era are blended in perfectly.  At about 2 hours and 15 minutes, this movie just flew by for me and each and every performance was near pitch perfect.

A fascinating movie, well acted and well directed.  Give it a shot.

As far as this product, I buy the cat and dog versions for my pets, it works great and doesn't seem to have any ill effects. In the winter my dog needs it about every 6-7 weeks, the cats only need it about every 10-12 weeks. In the summer my dog needs it every 4 weeks, cats every 6-8.

I have six cats (and many people would automatically discount any review I might offer based on that fact) so I consider myself uniquely suited to review litter boxes.  I will start out by saying that I also own a Litter Robot.  (Aside: the Litter Robot is an amazing thing, I love it and have absolutely no regrets about buying it...) When I acquired cats 4, 5 and 6 I decided that having two litter boxes was probably a good idea and I was not willing at that point to shell out another $300 for a second Litter Robot.  My boyfriend had an Omega Paw and told me over and over how great it was so I decided to try it for myself.  

My comments: My largest cat is a 25 lb behemoth who fits reasonably comfortably into the large size Omega Paw.  It is definitely roomier than the litter robot.  I promise if George can fit in the Large Omega Paw then any cat you have will fit easily.

I find the Omega Paw easy enough to keep clean.  I find rolling the box and emptying the tray to be a breeze and infinitely more pleasant than scraping with a scoop.  As a mater of fact, my 10 year old son gets a kick out of cleaning it and has taken over that chore for himself.  

I use a good clumping, odor controlling litter and I find that I have no problems with smell at all.  Note that I said "GOOD clumping, odor controlling" -- litter seems to make more difference than anything else in my experience.  

Overall, I give the Omega Paw highest marks -- just as great as the Litter Robot only not automatic.  For the price, it is pretty much perfect!

I have never, ever reviewed a product before, so that alone should tell you how incredibly happy I am with this product!  I absolutely LOVE Zymox!  Our dog is 2 1/2 years old and has had problems with her ears since we've had her.  Countless trips to the vet NEVER resulted in them telling us anything - only prescribing worthless (but expensive) ear drops.  Finally, we came to the conclusion ourselves that she must have a yeast infection in her ears (and her paws because she would chew at them constantly) due to her diet.  We figured she must be allergic to grain.  So, we tried these drops and switched to grain free food and treats (both are EVO, made by INNOVA).  It's only been a week since the switch and treatment and we can already see a 360 degree turn-around.  Granted, our dog hates when we put them in, but we can now actually touch her ears without causing her pain and discomfort.  If you've been to the vet over and over to no avail, I would definitely give these drops a try.  The price for these is 1/5 the price of a vet trip for me and with the money spent at the vet, we could've bought a dozen cases of Zymox.....and unlike a visit to the vet, these drops actually SOLVED the problem!  Highly recommend, along with a change in diet if your dog is prone to ear/yeast infections.

I bought this oven based on the reviews here and I'm glad I did. This unit was constructed better than most chain store models. The heating elements were the most powerful I've seen except "halogen" ovens- There is a radiant glow of energy eminating inside. Suggestion- please have the convection fans run even when the elements are off. Baking results great with frozen food. Watch out for toast however, burnt mine initially, but read instructions and it said use middle setting first then adjust. Had to set mine at LOWEST setting for perfect toast though wish I had more adjustment range for lighter toast. Five oven temperatures , and six time settings available- keeps it simple I guess?  This unit does not broil, but I rarely do that anyway, and it is dangerous in a small oven. I could have bought a Cuisanart unit as well, though I saw this item first, and gave it a shot. This unit is a keeper and my older tick-tock toaster oven will be put out to pasture!

A little disclaimer, before I criticize the little Bluetooth.  The dongle itself is great.  I use it solely for my mouse and it never wavers in connection.  Also, it was a bonus to find such a small one and a steal to find it at around $5.00.

So here's the only problem I had with it:
The driver that comes on the CD (Bluesoleil) is user friendly with a good GUI and intuitive way of connecting devices.  However, it frequently refuses to turn the dongle on, even when it recognizes that it's attached.  This is a problem when I use it for my mouse connection.  I've been using my old mouse as a precaution, which is counter-intuitive.  Also, it doesn't have an automatic start feature, so I have to turn it on manually to use the mouse with the keyboard.

To make things short, this probably isn't a Plug & Play device.  I'm still searching for better drivers, but it's a good product in and of itself.

   The Linksys WRT160n (Ver 2) replaces my old Linksys WRT54G ( I wrote a review in 2004 when it was new) that I sold to a friend along with an old Motorola G wireless bridge.

  This new router is a lot faster (270 MB) with a Linksys WGA600N Bridge (game adapter as its marketed) conected to my Xbox 360. And its wireless G performance with my dell laptop is also increased. Im 45 ft from the router on my G laptop (with a 12 inch thick concrete rebar wall in between) but the throughput on my new WRT160N is double that of my old WRT54G.

   My ISP is Caviler DSL. There performance is spotty at peak times but I usually get connection rates from 6-11 Mbps. Off peak hours I can stream available HD movies over Nexflix on my Xbox 360, transfer a 5 GB file from my PC to laptop while watching a different movie on netflix, look at a movie on youtube on my Iphone connected by Wifi, and play a game of chess over the net on my PSP all without any hiccips anywhere!. Thats impressive. I'd never had been able to do tht with my old wireless router.

   I paid $17 for the router and $90 for the bridge and they were both a great investment. I have sev other routers in my apt complx on channels 11 and 6 and my router automatically set up my network on channel 1. Its both fast and secure with WPA2 and took me all of 40 mins to set up including the router, bridge and 360. My gateway computer is a dell Dimension 8300 1.3 GB RAM, Win XP home, My laptop a Dell 1535 W/3 gb ram on Vista Home.

   I don't work in the IT dept at work by I'm familiar with Linksys web based setup utility. I tried setting up the router a second time using just that and found it pretty simple.

My Cuisinart is easy to use and lets me make my own ice cream without the additives so often found in store bought ice cream.  My favorite is the plain vanilla I make with organic dairy and sugar.  I dialed back the sugar and vanilla and found the perfect recipe for me.  Recipes come with the machine and they are good and most importantly for me easy.

This is the best toaster oven I owned thus far. The Black and Decker dont even come close to this oven. 1- Engineers put a lot of thought to make it safe when operating this product. When the door is opened, the tray slides out. This manner the hand never is near a hot surface. 2- The convection fan does an excellent job of heating food in a fast and easy manner. The fan is large so the heating process is rather quick. 3- The dials and knob are designed more like a micro wave oven, so learning to operate is quick and efficient. 4- Stainless steel frame makes it look real nice 4- Last but not least..The whole unit weighs less than 12 pounds..so its easy to move and store. We store ours in the cabinet after use, so we dont loose counter top space. Since its light weight and just the right size, its never a hassle to move it around and fits right in the kitchen cabinet. $80++ is well worth the money invested for this oven.

The Atom processor is noticebly faster than Pentium.  The keyboard is easy to adjust to and the battery cell life is 6 hours.  The light weight makes it easy to carry with you and rest on your lap.  I've purchased an external cd/dvd drive by Samsung as well and the installation was a simple plug in.  I am truly pleased with this purchase.

This movie, like the classic fairy tale, has it all: romance, intrigue, adventure!  Overall, it doesn't stray much from the traditional form; it has the hero, the `heroine', the villains, and the arch-nemesis in the form  of Prince Humperdink, who threatens to tear asunder the true love that is  the basis of this tale.   	What the novel and film succeed in  accomplishing is a fresh take on the traditional roles played out by the  hero and heroine.  Although Wesley is the main hero in Buttercup's world,  he is successful only with the help of Inigo and Fezzik.  Children will  understand that the film is slightly untraditional within a traditional  format.  We still see the men saving the woman (a woman, no less of  unsurpassed beauty), however, we do get to see them suffer minor defeats  and pitfalls in the process.  One qualm I have about this tale, is that  Buttercup fails miserably at saving herself every chance she gets.  I'm not  advocating the advent of hardcore feminist heroines who bake their own  bread and save their own behinds - I do believe that every fairy tale form  embodies values that are important to children - yet, it is not healthy to  portray a woman struggling to survive even in the smallest ways.  Is a  woman helpless without a husky male at her beck and call?  No.  The only  consolation in this kind of film being produced for an audience of children  is that it has some competition in the more updated and feminist versions  of the fairy tale.  Even though &quot;Girl Power&quot; has become a slogan  of the century, it still does not ensure that children will not absorb such  values about male and female roles.   	Great movie, just overlook  the sub-text ;)

I have tried several pedometers over the last couple of years. I found this one to be easy to program and use. The numbers are big enough it can be read easily without my glasses. I have tested against other machines to see the accuracy of my numbers and found it to be right on the mark. I loved it so much I have bought one for my walking partner!

I'm a person who's always had excellent dental history and great teeth so I was surprised on my last routine cleaning to see that heavy calculus had built up. After mentioning that I'd been using a Sonicare, my dentist immediately told me to switch to this toothbrush, claiming that it's a far more superior brush and a great value. Right after that visit I walked straight to Walgreens and bought one. Since then I've noticed a BIG difference in how much cleaner my teeth are. After doing some research I understood why the Vitality was so much better than Sonicare... the only method of brushing that is more effective than using a manual toothbrush was using one that brushes in a circular motion. With the Vitality you can really clean behind your teeth and reach all the way back to your molars very effectively; which I could not with Sonicare. I went in today for a routine cleaning and my teeth were looking great! For the quality and value of this toothbrush, it really can't be beat.

The product is really nicely designed.  The only complaint I have is that I should have gotten the larger one.  This one, in the picture, looks large enough, however about a third of the interior space (basically the entire right side of it) is taken up by the filtering pieces and waste disposal drawer.  Other than that though this is a great product and is a real time and litter saver.

Overall, this is a great pedometer. Its VERY accurate, has a 7 day memory, settings to show you steps walked, aerobic steps walked (whatever that means), calories burned (dont know how accurate that is), and distance walked (based on your stride length). Only one problem with it: the replacement battery (watch battery the size of a nickel) cost me $5.50 at Radio Shack. The pedometer cost me $20, yet the battery (which lasted about a year) cost me almost $6. You'd think in this day and age that they could design the pedometer to recharge itself just by the movement alone. They have watches that do that, so why not this ? So its a great item, just be aware of the cost of replacing the battery.

Very well made. Metal base can be screwed down or velcroed, and hub itself can be slid in and out. I have it attached vertically on the hutch atop my desk.(the product now includes an insert to keep the hub from sliding down in a vertical installation;it works fine) It is a pleasure to use since it is rock solid and at eye level. 3 ports face forward for temporary use like camera cards, ipods, etc. Rear-facing 4 ports have more permanent connections like printer, scanner, external hard drive. What sold me on this is the fact that, unlike desktop models, this will not slide around or require two hands to use. As for the blue light criticism, in my setup the light shines perpendicular to my field of vision, so it is not a factor at all. Everything I have plugged into it has worked, including the Sentry Safe fireproof waterproof external drive, which requires two powered USB ports.

This Headset is a great one. It is easy to use, and only takes a couple of seconds to set up. I have tried more expensive models, and have found that not only are they harder to figure out, but the quality of them doesnt match the price tag. Most of the time the cheaper the item the worse the quality, but I have had this headset for 2 years and it still works like its brand new. I use it for World of Warcraft, in a ventrilo client and it is superb for that.

Based on others reviews, I was completely comfortable with purchasing this machine.  The 9 cup base would more than serve my needs...and if I needed to process a smaller crop, the drop-in-bowl can handle it.

I received my shipment on a Tuesday, and by Friday evening, I had processed recipes for over 100 canning jars.  I now have everything ready for winter, from BBQ Sauce, Taco Sauce, Pizza Sauce, Spaghetti Sauce, Crisp Dill Pickles, Mexican Hot Sauce, Giardiniere, etc.  It's all canned and just waiting for us to open them and enjoy the harvest.

This machine was everything I'd hoped it would be...based on it being a KitchenAid product, and based on all the wonderful comments others left.

The day the food processor arrived, I went out to the garden and pulled crop and spent the wee hours into the night canning.  Have been for the past several weeks and I am so pleased with the quality of this food processor.  You get what you pay for.  There were other "cheaper" models out there, but the reviews on this Kitchen Aid Food Processor convinced me that it was the "perfect" product.  After using it several times, I feel it is quite the ABSOLUTE PERFECT FOOD PROCESSOR!!!

Enjoy this machine and feel comfortable purchasing it...it's THE BEST!!!

The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd is one of my wife's favorite books.  She was predisposed to love the movie.  It did not disappoint her.  So, when friends ask us for movie recommendations and 'Bees' comes up, she essentially recuses herself and defers me to give a more unbiased opinion.  

My opinion is that the movie succeeds on its own.  I've not read the book.  You don't have to read it to enjoy and appreciate it.  Queen Latifah has evolved into a regal screen presence.  My wife says she nailed the essence of June Boatwright.  Dakota Fanning is on track to be one of the few child actors to make a successful transition to adult roles.  She's extraordinarily talented. Critics continue to slight Jennifer Hudson (she got savaged in Sex and the City - The Movie (Exclusive Extended Cut)).  I honestly don't see what the problem is.  She seems a perfectly capable and likable actress to me.  The gorgeous Alicia Keys is also good in a tough role.

A signal to me that this was going to be a quality outing: the presence and oversight of director (and co-screenwriter along with Ms. Monk Kidd) Gina Prince-Bythewood.  She was the creative force behind the under-appreciated 2000 standout release Love and Basketball (New Line Platinum Series).  If you've not seen it already, that's a movie well worth your time.

I bought this product when my coworker and I decided to walk during lunch.  It's great, it provides how many steps I walk when I'm power walking and how many I complete by the end of the day.  I ended up buying 2 more for friends.  Great product, the battery lasts for about a year then you just go to Radio Shack and replace it.  Excellent product, will recommend to anyone.  Best pedometer around, I've gone through 3 other kinds and none of them had this many functions, like the clock, a 5day tracking progress, and the aerobic function.

I have only been using this pedometer a couple of weeks and haven't taken advantage of all its tracking features yet. Despite that, I am enjoying having it.     
One thing that particularly attracted me to this item is that it doesn't have to be clipped to your waistband for it to work.  I have been keeping it in my pocket and even tried hanging it around my neck for a few hours and it worked brillantly.  Unlike other (cheaper) pedometers that I have tried to use, I was able to get my stride length entered and the unit counting accurately for me.    
As I expected, the number of steps taken in an "average" day can be quite a revelation and I'm finding that seeing lower numbers of my less active days is an incentive to move more.
The only negative I have is that this product couldn't be shipped to Canada.  (I was lucky enough to have a relative with a U.S. postal box.) 
I definitely recommend this product.

Movie - 5.0

Where do we begin? I really don't know what I can say that most others haven't already. This movie is such a true epic to me in every sense of the word. So permit me then, to elaborate on my favorite aspect of the film -- what it means to be "more than a hero." When I saw this in theaters, I was in such awe of the drama, design, and overall writing of the entire film. Batman is a symbol, a symbol of hope, strength, and inspiration to those that might otherwise not be 100% content with themselves or their lives. The message I find most enlightening is in the definition of a "Dark Knight," to be an outcast, to be strong and take the pain and anguish that no one else would be willing to take, to serve as an example to inspire others so that one day even more people might be inspired by your own great and noble actions. They may not like you for it, some may even hate you. But it's not who you are underneath, it's what you do that defines you. And the ability to do/inspire great things always starts with yourself. Before the BD came out, my father suddenly passed away at the young age of 51. And as much as I missed him and wanted to cry, I instead thought back to these movies, remembered those inspiring words, and toughed it out to the best of my ability. I didn't cry because I knew I had to be strong for my mother and those around me. I didn't wanna' sink myself and live in some level of despair and make myself vulnerable. I gritted my teeth, told myself that there are people out there in far worse shape than I am, and I continued to live my life for my father's sake because I know what he did wasn't in vain. This movie is an absolute inspiration and ray of hope for me that I will never, ever let go of.

Video - 5.0

As opposed to its predecessor, The Dark Knight is presented to perfection on this BD-50. Colors are extremely vivid with skin textures and tones showing all sorts of details (especially the Joker's makeup). Blacks are deep with great shadow delineation, giving much of the film as realistic a presentation as digitally possible at the moment for home theaters. Then of course there's the whole IMAX integration and ratio-flip element, which by the way is no bother to me at all. Resolution on the IMAX shots are no-brainer, reference quality demo material that you can and should always use to show off your Blu-ray setup for guests.

Audio - 5.0

I normally keep audio reviews strictly to audio quality of the BD itself, but I really feel the need to accentuate the amazing score of this movie by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard since they weren't even given an Oscar nomination nod for their work. In Batman Begins, I felt the music was primarily used as accompaniment. You watch a scene, something happens, and the music plays in the background. In The Dark Knight, I found it clever in how they managed to use the music itself as more of a sound effect to help build the tension of certain sequences, as opposed to just playing it in the background to compliment an already-established mood. I point this out because I feel it especially helps in displaying just how great LFE levels are in this movie from the low bass notes of the Joker's theme to the loud and anarchistic chase sequence. Directionality and dynamics of sound effects, dialogue clarity, the integration of effects and music, all of it fits for a stunning display of aural excellence. Even if it is just 16-bit, this is reference quality and very much deserving of its Oscar nominations in (at LEAST) sound/design/editing. Watch out, Iron Man.

Extras - 5.0

I watched most of the "big" extra features, which I think equaled out to something like two hours and fifteen minutes. In particular, the production feature about the stunts, design, IMAX filming, and coordination were very impressive. The scene with the flipping eighteen wheeler was the part I've always wondered about, since I've never actually heard/seen an eighteen wheeler with my own ears/eyes. But that's the magic of Hollywood visual effects for ya', they really did flip that damn thing over &lt;-- impressive. I also enjoyed the IMAX segment, as I'm not too familiar with the practice myself, but am certainly more curious about now after experiencing it for myself through one of the theatrical viewings of this film (IMAX is huge, but it's really cold in those rooms). The "Batman Tech" featurette was pretty interesting as well, but I couldn't stand that narrator. I'll have to watch it again some time. The best part, however was the "Batman Psychology" feature. I've always been interested in the subtleties of the human mind, and seeing people analyze him and his nemeses from a semi-professional view was cool. All extras are presented in HD, by the way.

Overall - 5.0

Currently this is my all-time favorite film. It has action, drama, great characters, epic storytelling, Oscar-caliber production qualities, and an eerily awesome performance by Heath Ledger that has permanently burned itself into my brain (believe it or not, this is actually the only movie I've seen him in, at the moment). I saw this opening day and heard zero hype. If you're reading this and haven't seen it yet, but would like to, then I encourage you give it a shot. If you call my review hype, then I'm sorry I, myself, liked it so much that you might not agree. But that's the beauty of differing opinions.

As a result of a diet, both my wife and I found that we were wheat-sensitive, and finding good tasting wheat-free, gluten-free (WF/GF) bread in our friendly grocery store proved to be impossible. WF/GF bread made from scratch involves a sticky mess that will quickly clog hand-held mixers. But, with the purchase of this KitchenAid Pro 600, that's a thing of the past. 

The mixer easily combines the WF/GF flours, gums and other ingredients with a minimum of fuss and bother. We now carry the mixer with us when we travel in our RV, and I've made WF/GF bread and muffins with ease. It's heavy enough to not walk across the counter when operating, yet light enough to tote with us. I premix the flour combinations with the whisk, then change to the paddle when adding liquids. The 6-quart bowl is large enough for two 1 1/2 pound loafs, and should easily accomodate two 2-lb loaves. I'd recommend this mixer to anyone.

I brought this joystick because it was the closest 'Playstation-style' joystick I could find for a computer. I thought it was okay initially due to its inability to program diagonal directions on the D-pad. Couldn't get it to program 2-keys simultaneously (i.e. Up arrow + left arrow for upper-left diagonal button). I ended up having to use the left axis joystick just so I can move diagonally. However, with the version 4.40 software update that came out at Logitech's website 6/22/04, I have to increase my rating. This joystick works great now! :) I can now use the D-Pad like those found on the Playstation controls (4 directional buttons instead of 8). This can be done by selecting the 'FPS Style Movement' option when editing D-Pad. Afterward, just program the 4 buttons--N, W, E, S to Up, left, Right, & Down. Now, pressing diagonal buttons on the D-pad will result in diagonal movements.  I suggest uninstalling old joystick software & temporary disable anti-virus before updating to v4.40.  Else, you may run into `Windows restarting' problems when attempting to run `profiled' games like I did.  There are other improvements with the updated software, but I haven't tried those yet. Don't get me wrong this joystick still need improvement, like some said...it's sometimes hard to press left without accidentally verging to upper left or lower left on the D-pad.  Some people mentioned having calibration problems. I rarely have these, if I did, moving the axis stick around for a few seconds or restarting the game seems to fix the problem. So, I far haven't had calibration problems yet with software update v4.40. Then only time will till if that will change. Also, another improvement Logitech could make is the material used on the D-pad buttons.  It should use similar material as the axis sticks (soft rubber) instead of hard plastic. Also, making directional button cross shape (+) would made D-pad less error-prone to verging into wrong directions. Even with some of these joystick's shortcomings, I still think this joystick is a good buy :). It's better than most that I tried and cheaper too, now priced around $15. I would recommend this joystick for those who especially use emulators and like Playstation-style joystick.

Sometimes - maybe all the time, we humans forget that we're not the only earthlings. And like ants on a counter top, we are unable to take in the diversity and power of the life and geology around us. Planet Earth has taken on the challenge to awaken our senses, treat our eyes and ears and, explode our personal myths of the dominance of "man". The production and photography are amongest the best! Stunning, magnificent and breathtaking don't do the film justice. We have been glued to our seats as we've been introduced to animals and plants we've never seen and the familiar are even more amazing thanks to the tireless and often risky business of photography in the wilds. This production will become a classic because every aspect of the film has been carefully thought out - serendipity, not withstanding. You may not need to own this but you must see it. 
The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the producers just had to gratuitously throw in the most over done wildlife episodes seen on almost every wildlife program - the wildebeast crossing with the crocodiles, the wolf hunt, dog hunt, lion hunt, the shark "attack", etc., etc.  These could have been left out as everyone with access to a Tv has probably seen these ad nauseum.

A wheel is supposed to turn, a camera is supposed to take pictures, and a hub is supposed to allow you to connect multiple devices.  This one does.  The shape and style matches my D-Link USB2/Firewire hub, so I just stacked one on top of the other.  The LED lights make it easy to find in the dark.  The power cord was long enough to reach my power strip.  I have no idea what more one would want in a hub.  It works.

The mini-series was great as was season one.  Season two sees no fall-off in quality of this adult sci-fi series.  These three CDs contain only the first 10 episodes of season two.  We'll have to wait a while for the last half of the season.  

The backstory is that the robotic cylons have attacked and nearly exterminated the human race.  Only the Battlestar Galactica and its motley fleet remain and it is infiltrated by cylons in human form.  The objective of the BG is not victory but simple survival and a hiding place. Season two opens with a bang: Captain Adama is unconscious on the operating table and Colonel Tigh is in control of the Galactica and the fleet. Tigh proves not to be up to the job. I like Tigh -- very well acted by Michael Hogan -- because he is a vastly imperfect person plauged by a sexy, shrewy wife, alcohol addiction, insubordinate underlings, and his own aversion to leadership. But he's a competent shipdriver and loyal to Adama. Predictably, things get even worse as the season goes on, with the underlying theme of conflict between civilian and military authorities, father and son, lovers and losers, cylons and man....These folks know trouble.  And there's no end to it.  Every episode gets them deeper into the muck.   

What makes this series special is its exploration of human relationships and fralities in a hyper-tense situation.  Every one of about 10 major characters is distinctive and finely drawn. There's plenty of shoot-em-up adventure too, led by the bawdy, hot-shot pilot Starbuck and Captain Adama's tortured son, Lee. Add a few hot and heavy love scenes, a touch of religous mysticism, and you have sci-fi noir bred with space opera. The constant theme of suspicion and mistrust makes every episode a nail-biter. Who's a cylon and who's not?  What are the cylons' objectives?  Stay tuned.  Someday it will all become clear.

Overall, this is a very strong first season, with great characterization, a strong story plot, and nice special effects. If anything, the state of humanity's last remnants is even more precarious and desperate than in the miniseries, and the appealing story line of the last of humankind, desperately looking for their lost homeworld, never fails to hold one's interest. The only reason for four stars is that the series gets off to a somewhat slow start, and I'd really give it four and a half stars if I could. But other than that, it's a great series and well worth your time.

Those of us old enough to remember Jack LaLanne doing jumping jacks as we watched on  black and white television sets will recall that the early fitness guru was really into fresh juices. My original intent was to get one of those rotating machines where you press an orange onto it and out comes a glass of juice. It turns out these juicers are not as easy to find as they used to be. So I decided to upgrade a bit and get this machine.

If you are making orange or other citrus juice you need to remove the peel first. This is because this baby will liquify anything. Pulverized orange peel is not that tasty. So at the start, it is messier and takes more work than using a rotating juice extraction device. But that is the only real advantage. 

LaLanne's makes a great cup of orange juice. And if that is all the use it gets, you will not be disappointed. However shortly after I got it, I was asked by my wife to get some apple juice for some apple sauce she was making. While picking up my keys on the kitchen counter, I spied Jack's machine, and being basically lazy, I took two apples and ran them through the juicers. The result was delicious. I had no idea an apple had so much juice.

Now there will be those who will want to juice carrots and celery and other healthy items. I am sure this product will work just fine. But as for me, I am content drinking fruit juices. If I get really brave some day, I might try a tomato.

You can take it off and change it cause the matt on the play pen gets stained so this is a great item to have.  I have 2 the saige and the creamy ivory colered ones.  Do I recomment it?  Most definately.

I bought this rice cooker after the latch on my old Sunpentown one broke ($60, used for 6 years).  In terms of taste, I can't see too much of a difference between this one and my old Sunpentown.  However, my old rice cooker didn't have a timer, and the timer function on this rice cooker is probably its best attribute (followed closely by the porridge cooker function).  It takes a lot longer for this rice cooker to cook than my old one, but the timer function takes care of that nicely.  If you're just looking for something to cook plain white rice once in a while as an alternative to cooking rice on the stove, I think you can find cheaper alternatives.  However, if you like having a timer and multiple modes of cooking, this might be worth the money.

I eat rice with every meal, so this was a great purchase.  It's also nice waking up to perfectly cook breakfast porridge.

I bought the 4G nano after reading about Apple's inclusion of accessibility features for blind users.  While the implementation is not complete, it is good enough to allow me to operate the basic functions of the device.

When connecting through iTunes 8, you can turn on voiced menus. On a Windows machine, iTunes will use the system's default text-to-speech engine and settings to voice most of the menus and media on the iPod.  Some menus not voiced, but the important ones are.  After sync'ing, I have occasionally had an unvoiced podcast folder.  The contents are voiced, just not the menu name.  The next time I sync, this generally is corrected, and the problem is sporadic and not a huge deal.  

I switched to the iPod after growing frustrated with Rockbox on a Sansa.  While Rockbox had a much more comprehensive implementation of voice technology, the device crashed one too many times.  The iPod hasn't got all teh bells and whistles of Rockbox, but it has been much more stable,... so far.

Having read a report in a leading consumer magazine, I found this to be their choice in pedometers.  I was hoping to use it at work, as I do walk a lot, however due to the inconsistent steps I take, it would not work in that environment.  So great for accuracy, but definitely for exercise more than for curiousity.

I switched from TurboTax to TaxCut this year primarily due to Intuit's new pricing structure where they both raised the base price quite a bit and then they charge $9.95 for each additional return you want to prepare beyond the first one.  Given those changes, it was time to try something else.

So far I am very pleased with TaxCut.  It imported my TurboTax data from last year without any problems at all.   It also will import data from Quicken, though I don't use that option.

It is a different interface and takes a little getting used to, but then TurboTax's interface changes every year also so with either product one is going to have to adjust to some new interface quirks.

Of course, it is pretty early to be running software, since the IRS is still finalizing things for 2008, and such things as the Alternative Minimum Tax haven't been nailed down, but TaxCut still did a very good job helping me see where I was going to come out on my taxes for 2008.  And that includes my schedule C for a consulting business.  Obviously, there will be a bunch of updates in a few weeks, but that is to be expected from any Tax Software at this stage.

TaxCut also did a nice job helping me plan for 2009 taxes as well.  I had already done some planning using a Numbers Spreadsheet on the Macintosh and so I could tell whether TaxCut was pretty accurate.  It was.

Overall, for those who are thinking about switching to TaxCut this year from TurboTax, my take is that I found it easy to do.

Its a fine router by Linksys with easy set up. I've had it for over a month now and there have been no problems. My issues with Linksys home routers are its life span. They claim over 3 years, but my last two have been 15 and 18months. I had an outage and had to reset or update my router. Since the easy initial steps to reset didn't work and I do not speak 'router lingo', I went out and just a got a new one. I would not be ordering this product nor writing this product review if the router lasted.

I bought this based on its reviews and King Arthur Flour recommending it.  I've used it mostly for making dough, but it makes good bread as well.  Easy to use.  Nice shaped loaf, though somewhat tall, whole slice won't toast well in toaster.  I'm hoping it lasts long, given it wasn't inexpensive.  Thus while excellent quality, hard to know how good a value.

This review is from: Religulous [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)

      



I watched this movie with a group of well educated friends with a wide range of religious backgrounds and we all came to the same conclusion: taking religion too seriously is exactly what brought the world to the problems we are facing today. Don't you think that something is seriously wrong when children's fantasy books like Harry Potter are criticized by religious groups for promoting witchcraft among children? And fiction like the DaVinci Code can generate dozens of books disproving the religious references?  If we don't question murky ancient history and don't let our children read fairy tales, what will we become?  

And that brings me to the main reason of why I enjoyed this movie so much so I felt compelled to review it. Bill Maher might appear sarcastic, cynical and downright mocking in this documentary, but if you look past his humorous dialogue you will see that his intent was not to humiliate but to question. He didn't attempt to cast doubt on the validity of people's belief in something greater then themselves, and he made a point in the beginning of the movie to emphasize the fact that only the very fortunate can afford not to believe. What he did examine were issues such as blind bona fide belief in texts written thousands of years ago, justification for racial/religious intolerance in the name of God, certainty in scientifically unsupported ideas of creationism, etc. Many people all over the world believe that Scientology is a cult, but what makes their man/men in the sky any less real than the ones preached by Christians/Jews/Muslims and countless other religions? None of the people interviewed, be it a common man/woman, Priest/Rabbi/Mullah or a US senator could provide a logical answer.

I've read through a number of negative reviews for this movie expecting to understand the rationale for such criticism, but other than the universal dislike for Bill Maher's sarcasm (which I found refreshing by the way), people generally skipped half the movie and concentrated on one or two uncomplimentary points about their own personal doctrine - automatically judging the whole thing unsatisfactory. You can see that people failed to grasp the bigger picture that not all beliefs are necessarily true and continuously questioning authority (be it religious or legislative)  is the way of progress, growth and equality. In other words, in order to understand the message for this movie, you must do so with an open mind.  Who knows, you might learn a thing or two :)

My 16 year old daughter was told by many friends to read these books for weeks, and she reluctantly started book 1 on a Sunday night.  Well, by Tuesday night she was well on her way to finish book 2!  She was sooo obsessed, I had to take away the book from her at midnight because it was a school night! She begged me to read them and I thought, it's just a teenage love story and I'm too busy to read anyways. After many days of her telling me "mom, it will change your life"! I decided to read the first chapter to see what all the hysterics were about. Well in no time at all I too was addicted!  No joke, I could not put the book down! I read all four books in 10 days! I own a little restaurant here in Southern California with my husband and told all my waitresses about the books and they just laughed about my new found obsession. So for Christmas I bought all my waitresses each the Twilight book and told them "just read the first chapter and see if you don't get hooked! Well, as I guessed, all of them were hooked and our lunch shift and dinner shifts were filled with talk about the books!  My husband was furious with me that I got them all so hooked they forgot to check on customers at times.  It has been so much fun to be able to share with so many people our love of these books! I recommend the books to everyone! As for the Movie, we all got together and went to watch the midnight show so that no waitress could miss out. There was 8 of us all together! I hope this review makes everyone want to read the books and buy the movie because as my daughter once said "it will change your life".

This product is just insanely good. I opened the package and immediately tried it on my dog, just to see how it works. First stroke, it removed a big chunk of hair. I continued to try it all over my dog, and by the time I was done, there was a huge pool of hair in my living room. I couldnt believe he was carrying so much on him. I had tried 3 different de-shedding brushes before but none of them were useful or even came close to this. Every single day I was vacuuming my floor to pick hairs he was leaving behind. I was a little apprehensive about spending 30+ bucks on a dog brush but now that I have tried, I think its totally worth every penny. I am sure going forward, I dont have to vacuum everyday. Yippie!!!

I love my Sonicare toothbrush and bought these replacement heads to go with it.  They do an excellent job but really only last about 3 months, based on my experience using them twice a day for probably 1.5 minutes per use on average.  That works out to about $40 a year for brush heads which is somewhat steep, hence the 4 star review.

"WALL稥" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Set in a galaxy not so very far away, WALL稥 is the new Disney/Pixar comedy about one determined robot. After hundreds of lonely years doing what he was built for, WALL稥 (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) discovers a new purpose in life when he meets a sleek search robot named EVE (Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator). When EVE comes to realize that WALL稥 has inadvertently stumbled upon the key to the planet's future, she races back to space to report her findings. And while she sets off to tell the waiting humans that it's safe to return home, WALL稥 chases EVE across the galaxy on his own unique adventure. The voice cast led by Ben Burtt (who also did the film editing and sound design to Episodes I-III of the Star Wars franchise (1999, 2002, & 2005), also did the sound design to Episodes IV-VI of the Star Wars franchise (1977, 1980, & 1983), and also did the sound design to the Indiana Jones movies (1981, 1984, 1989, & 2008) (as the voice of WALL稥 / M - O, he also did the sound design to the film) and Elissa Knight (as the voice of Eve) is brilliant! The directing and screenplay by Andrew Stanton (who also did the screenplays and the storys to "Finding Nemo" (2003), "Toy Story 1 & 2" (1995 & 1999), "A Bug's Life" (1998) & the screenplay to "Monsters, Inc." (2001) is brilliant! The music by Thomas Newman (who also did the music to "Finding Nemo" (2003), and Sam Mendes' films ever since "American Beauty" (1999) is beautiful and brilliant! The film editing by Stephen Schaffer (who also did the film editing to "The Incredibles" (2004) is excellent! The production design by Ralph Eggleston (who also did the production design to "Finding Nemo", was an art director on "Toy Story" & "The Incredibles", and also wrote the story to "Monsters, Inc.") is brilliant! This is a cinematic and animated masterpiece. This is also a beautiful, brilliant, and heartwarming film that will tug at your heartstrings. This is the best film of the year, if not the best animated film of the decade, so far. This is just as brilliant, if not, better than, Pixar's last film, last year's "Ratatouille" (2007). This is definitely going to win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature at the Oscars next year.

Saitek X52 Pro Flight System Controller I have had a lot of sticks. Logitech, Sidewinders,CH Products, Saitek evo series, ect... This stick is very well made. Software can be confusing. Takes getting used to but the ability to calibrate while in game a big plus. The rotary controls smooth. The 4 way and 8 way hat switches in good locations. Stick sorta bound up at first until I applied a little lithium grease to the shaft. No problem.Had this stick for about 3 months. No regrets.

I have seen no signs of the super quick wear to the keys some reviews spoke of. On the contrary after using this keyboard for more than a month I appreciate its durability (cat has unnatural attraction to it as a place to sleep). The keyboard itself has a very nice solid feel. The keys have a orange peel look and feel, and so if you cannot stand any kind of texture you might find this annoying...or you might not, its a very light textural feel. I happen to like it as it gives a bit of textural feedback to go with what I think of as a mid weight keypress resistance. My mom who was a typist at one time (she learned on manual typewriter then used an electronic then a computer) thinks it has a harder keypress than her computers basic keyboard, but her current keyboard is at least 8 years old and very well broken in. 

The grippy feet and the weight keep it very stable. The black areas of the keyboard are a bit greyed out from a combination of oils off of my hands, cat fur and dust from a desert environment. The black has a bit of a tendency to show scratch marks...but that is true for any shiny black surface that will happen. 

The only minor quibble I have is that while the light intensity can be adjusted (and stays adjusted) when you change the LED color will reset to default blue when you restart or turn your computer off. Overall there is absolutely no question that I love the thing.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)

      



This is my 2nd Ooma review, the first one has been up and running for about 9 months, and the only real gripes I have are one or two dropped calls and the odd bad connection.
I will at this point strongly recommend using this as a stand alone line with a new local number provided by Ooma. I don't like the piggybacking idea and have heard of several people suffering fees from their local phone companies after they tag the Ooma system onto their internet and phone setup. I have also noticed bad days with the machine, and considering how it works by peer sharing of internet connection to speed up dialling and clarity, there are times when I have been cut off mid conversation, and then had several missed attempts at reconnection.
Also international calls often dial through and you can hear the person on the other end, but they cannot hear you so you must hang up and try again, this can get frustrating. All that said, a 2 minute connection procedure to any existing hardline internet connection (doesn't work wirelessly in case you were wondering) gives you FREE and unlimited calling local and long distance within the US. The international plan involves setting up a credit card on the website and "adding" minutes.
This is where the Ooma scores the best. Before using Ooma my monthly phone calls to Europe (UK mainly) were on average $30 - this was on an international plan ($5 per month) and then calls at only 8c per minute, which is pretty cheap. Since having the Ooma I have spent only $80 in 9 months! Calls are 2.9c - do the math.
Is the Ooma cost effective for just US usage? Well that's subjective and you need to figure out your break even point before laying out $250 for this package(which is $150 cheaper than it used to be by the way). Is it perfect? No, then again what system is? Vonage for example has a lot of VoiP problems and involves a monthly agreement. This new set which includes a "Scout" for additional phone jack points is certainly good value, just do some research on your existing bills first.
Overall I rated it 4 stars, not only for all that I've mentioned but because it is SO easy to install. The online account information and remote retrieval of voice mail is great, and the Scout adds a second line for free. Great product.

My digital signal was getting too weak using a splitter.  Every splitter cuts the signal in half and my cable runs are 50-100' each.  I wanted to share 3 TVs on my attic antenna.   Installing the PCT-MA2-4P in the attic next to the antenna, using a power inserter solved the problem.   Just like each TV had is own 12' long antenna.    Many distribution amps require an AC outlet at the distribution amplifier and I didn't want to install a duplex outlet in the attic.   The PCT-MA2-4P with the power inserter allowed me to have the power supply at the TV set and distribute power over the coax cable.   This solved my problem perfectly.

Excellent in every way. Doc was about to put me on BP reducing med, but I talked him into getting a month of baseline readings before I filled the prescription. Good thing as it turned out that not only was my BP normal and required no intervention, but his wall unit in his office was giving out false high readings! Not only did it save me from a possible disaster, others may have been rescued as well. And of course I saved $$$$ by not having to fill the prescription(it was expensive at $60 per month!) Incidentally, it is the best price on the 'net, too! Thank you for excellent service and an excellent product!

Update: 11 Feb 09. This is an excellent camera, but it has one of the most quirky interfaces I've ever seen. Trying to explain how to use this camera to someone over the phone would be akin to describing how to tell someone else how to ride a unicycle blind-folded. Other than that, and once you figure out the "joy stick" (still can't believe they call it that) and the multifunction power/control switch...you're there. Fine camera, but don't  get in a hurry trying to use it. That small human interface problem aside, I would still recommend purchase.  

Although the indoor light setting for automatic exposure leaves the video image slightly grainy, this is still a fantastic system. It's bright day and outdoor color is perfect and life-like. We're using TDK mini DVDs purchased here at Amazon and they work well. 

The only kink in the system with the DC310 Camcorder is the requirement to connect the AC wall charger to the camcorder unit before "burning" the disc inside the player (after making your recording). This is a little strange. Imagine being somewhere remote where you wanted to record on 2 or 3 mini DVD discs and were without an AC outlet. 

The result would be an inability to burn your DVDs, so you would be stuck with only one disc worth. Perhaps this isn't a big deal, but if you plan on burning your DVDs somewhere in the boon docks, you better have an AC outlet and your charger in the case. 

On the positive side, the unit is very capable and in keeping with the high quality you expect from Canon. The "still" camera function works great with a standard size SD card (not a Micro as advertised) and it's easy to install and remove. 

Video capture is easy and fairly intuitive, and the stabilization works nicely. The display to the left is very clear, and my only complaint is the very illogical process that is required to go from recording complete to burning your discs. However, once you've memorized the steps and button-functions (as well as an odd joystick on the display panel), you'll be set and happy with the unit. I recommend shooting a disc or two prior to using this camera for anything important. This way, you won't be disappointed. 

Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase. Amazon treats its customers like kings, and they stand by their products. 

I highly recommend purchase of this camcorder due to its high quailty, small but solid size, and very reliable service.

I'd rate them up there with Ben and Jerry's in the store, easily!Try buying vanilla beans and storing them in a container with your sugar. Use the sugar in your ice cream for a super intense vanilla flavor with out too much liquid!mmmmm

Microsoft Office Professional 2007 FULL VERSION

I had to purchase a new copy of Microsoft Office Professional (my old PC died and took all of the details of my prior version with it) and found that Amazon.com offered the best price, quickest delivery and, as always, is a reliable vendor.

As to the 2007 version of the suite of Microsoft programs, I am still learning where everything is at.  There are a few things I like on the new Excel that now can be done in one click, but having to go to different tabs for different functions is a pain.  I am moving links from inside the office button to the quick access toolbar - why Microsoft didn't just leave everything on the quick access toolbar is a puzzlement.  Probably some former Apple employee working for Microsoft now.

We bought this mixer to replace an old Kitchenaid that finally died after 17 years. 

We both love this mixer.  The larger bowl volume and wider width of the bowl make it much easier to add ingredients while mixing.  The slow start up also is a great feature that helps keeps ingredients in the bowl and not all over the kitchen.  The power is great when using the attachments.

Cons.  The only real con is that it doesn't handle smaller batches as well because of the bigger bowl.  We have purchased an "aftermarket" beater that has spatula edge to see if this helps.

I would recomend this to any serious cooks or bakers.  If you are an occasional home cook I would suggest a smaler model.

HOWEVER - if you are looking for a headset for gaming purposes, you can literally get the improved model of this headset for the same price or cheaper at Wal*Mart, so I would recommend going that rout. Also, it is true what the review say about the behind-the-head design. If you wear glasses, this could be a problem, and extended use beging to hurt your ears.

All in all, I am still happy with my purchase.

Fascinated by its rave reviews I leaped on the LAC05. It is the best small appliance I have ever had. It is super efficient in having our steel cut oats ready in the morning (timer is to the minute). The rice is as good as any Asian restaurant. The capacity is fine for 2-4 people. I love its thoughtful musical reminders. The technology is precise, thorough and downright entertaining. Nothing is missing in this little unit. Getting used to the foreign translation was the only adjustment. And I used the rice menu once for porridge and the consequences were enough that I have not made the mistake twice. I purchased a rice cooker on a whim. It is like a new Cadillac on a much smaller scale. I look for reasons to use it.

i read a number of customer reviews before choosing this ice cream maker, &amp; i am very glad i did. by taking the advice of people who had already used this machine, i was able to make outstanding ice cream on my first try. first, i left the bowl in the freezer for several days before i used it, in order to make certain that it was totally frozen.second, after mixing the ingredients for my ice cream, i chilled the whole mixture in the fridge overnight.third, i gave the mixture a good whipping with an electric mixer before i poured it into the machine.finally, i worked in small batches. since the bowl was totally frozen &amp; the ingredients were quite cold, i was able to make two batches of ice cream, one after the other, without refreezing the bowl in between.having taken all these measures, i was able to make ice cream that was a pleasant soft serve right out of the machine, &amp; quite firm after a night of tempering in the freezer.if you simply follow the instructions in the manufacturer manual, you may get disappointing results. but, if you benefit from the experience of other owners, you will no doubt enjoy this machine a great deal. it's very easy &amp; convenient to use, &amp; clean-up is a snap.in closing, i whole-heartedly recommend the chocolate truffle ice cream recipe that is excerpted from bruce weinstein's Ultimate Ice Cream Book on this site.

After leaving the theater in 2005 nearly wiping tears from my eyes after watching the genius of Batman Begins, I said "part of me wishes they would never make another film because there's no way they could come close to the perfection of this movie".

I was wrong.

For the past 2 years I have been awaiting The Dark Knight with more excitement than any other movie in my life. Searching the net daily for new information, watching the trailers around 500 times (no exaggeration) and following the genius viral marketing plan online, I knew that The Dark Knight would be an amazing effort and my expectations were through the roof. I expected a nearly perfect movie and my expectations were EXCEEDED.

To avoid spoiling this work of genius, a short recap is all I will provide. After the events of Batman Begins the city is in chaos and a new threat emerges in the form of the psychotic Joker. Wanting to inflict anarchy and disorder, the Joker has no real ulterior motives other than to cause trouble and misery for the residents of Gotham. With the help of Lt. Gordon and newly elected DA Harvey Dent, the Batman faces his toughest nemesis ever as he tries to saved his beloved city so he can one day take off his mask for good and Bruce Wayne can be with his true love Rachel.

Cast/Production Opinions
------------------------

GENIUS

Heath Ledger - Ledger's performance as The Joker quite simply is THE definitive take on the clown prince of crazy and a genius display of acting. All the hype that has been directed at Ledger is not without merit. Not only does Ledger give the greatest villain performance I have ever seen, he LIVES The Joker. The little nuances, walks, grunts, etc. is absolute CANDY for the viewing audience. If you have wanted a menacing Joker that cares about nothing and just wants to cause mayhem, this Joker will become THE Joker forever. So much more than just a character, Ledger gives one of the great performances in film history.

PERFECTION

Gary Oldman - The 2nd best performance in the TDK and another amazing performance as Lt. James Gordon. For anyone that is a fan of Batman Year One and the comics, you will appreciate Oldmans work nearly as much as Ledger. Quiet, subdued, and wonderful, you CARE for Lt. Gordon and you are happy when things go his way. This is an amazing work and can't be ignored.

Location - Chicago really was a perfect place to film these movies. The city looks amazing and you really feel like you are in Gotham.

NEAR PERFECTION

Christian Bale - Fantastic Bruce Wayne, perfect as Batman, obv the movies don't work if he doesn't. On par with the greatness of his work in Batman Begins. I don't think it's better work here, I think in both movies he is amazing equally.

Michael Caine - Wonderful as Alfred as per usual.

Christopher Nolan - Another wonderful job directing. The IMAX shots really add to the film and the opening shots in IMAX make you go WOW. Is Nolan capable of making a bad movie?

Writing - Great script which is very dense. This might not be for everyone but having a dense story done right only adds to the longevity of the film over time.

Gadgets - The new Batpod and other cool stuff are still realistic and not over the top. Any technology that is introduced in the movie serves a good purpose and makes sense.

GREAT

Aaron Eckhart - Great performance that makes you CARE about Harvey Dent and what he is trying to do for the city of Gotham. At the end of the movie when he's not the same person that he was at the beginning he still gives a great performance

Morgan Freeman - Such a great actor and he builds on his character from Batman Begins, very solid

GOOD

Maggie Gyllenhaal - This is one of the only weak parts of the movie. I never criticized Katie Holmes in Batman Begins because I thought she did a fine job acting and her baby faced innocence I thought was a good match for Bruce Wayne. I just thought she was too young. I think Gyllenhaal was in a tough spot with this role. She comes into TDK with a character already created and she doesn't seem sure how to act accordingly. Does she be Dawes as Katie Holmes or a new version? I think she's good in the movie but I would have rather had Holmes return. She could have done so much more but I felt she was lazy in this role.


The Dark Knight is THE definitive "super hero" movie but it is so much more. You don't have to like Batman or super heroes to enjoy this film and it will be the quickest 2 1/2 hours of your life. Any time Ledger is on the screen it's pure candy and he's on the screen just enough, making you yearn for more.

Great story, incredible directing, amazing/great performances and the genius of Heath Ledger make this not only the best film of 2008 but one of the great movies of all time. In terms of sequels it might BE the greatest sequel ever (I would put Godfather Part II and Aliens right up there as well) and it DOES live up to the hype.

See The Dark Knight in IMAX if you can to enjoy the scenes filmed in this format, but make sure you see this movie over and over again.

A masterpiece.

I really like this pedometer. I love the fact it can sit in my pocket and still keep track of my mileage. Because it has been really good, My parents have both purchased the pedometer, as well as a friend of mine. For the money it is a good deal. I have actually now owned 2 of these pedometers. The first did really well for a few months, but after I changed the battery, it never seemed to work very well again. Mine is the only one to have problems. I have trouble keeping watches working due to something in my body, so there is a chance, the problems that I have had with the pedometer may be the same trouble I have with watches. I bought a new one, and it still is working great

I ordered this pedometer after trying several others, none of which worked very well. But the OMRON pedometer is wonderful! It counts every step, which really does encourage you to walk an extra few more steps each day. It is easy to set up and to use (just put it on and walk!). The one thing I found tricky was figuring out how to open the "leash" clamp--it opens by bending the top over to the side, which opens the clamp right up. I have a friend who bought another brand of electronic pedometer for over $60 and she is buying one of these OMRON pedometers after she saw mine. Several friends, who asked me what it was that I was wearing, asked me to order one for them too. I ordered 7 more from Amazon and am buying three more today. They are really great. Thanks, OMRON!

I purchased this based on the Consumer Reports recommendation.......it is very accurate.  With my job, I do a lot of walking, but it also includes getting in and out of cars.  When I had the pedometer in my pocket, sometimes the way I moved it would reset it.  I took care of that problem by flipping the pedometer so the buttons were inside the holder.  Problem solved.  I would recommend this for ease and accuracy.

I found this book to be very helpful. It doesn't just give you the steps to do little tasks like some of the other books I looked at; it explains the features and why you would use them, and shows you how to do things from start to finish.

I bought mine more than a year ago and use it almost daily.  Lately my husband and son have "discoved" mine and are constantly asking to borrow it.  I bought cheaper mp3 players for neices last year and was disapointed in the feel of those.  They were lightweight plastic and didn't have a backlight at all.  This Sansa is nice weight, with a durable feel.  After a year + of use it still functions like new.  I'm very pleased with mine and the price is just right.  The only down side that I have found is an operational error... when I lend it out, the borrowers don't always hold down the power button for the required 3-5 seconds and the battery is usually dead when I finally track it down and retreive it from them.  This is the primary reason I'm getting them their own....

This review is from: Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition) (DVD)

      




One of the most recent in the Marvel Comic-book to screen translations of classic superheros, this time it's Iron Man about Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.); the young, egotistical heir to Stark Industries (weapon creators and manufactuers).

On a routine trip in the middle east Tony gets taken prisoner and is demanded to build his newest weapon, the jericho, for these criminals. With a little help Tony plots his only way of escape, an iron suit.

When Tony finally returns home he is a changed man, destined to return to seek his revenge on the men that held him captive, and of course  get his weapons back from the wrong hands. 

Similar to Batman Begins, Iron Man is more focused on the acts of Tony becomming the Iron Man, then infact jumping completely into an action packed adventure, amazingly it's thurough enough to get the full story yet the pace never draws too slow. 

Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant as Mr. Tony Stark, he carries that perfect overconfident yet always believable attitude . 

One of the best superhero movies yet.

Talk about the PERFECT Ice cream maker for your home. I am really happy that I talked my husband into this one. It makes up to 1-1/2 quarts ice cream, frozen yogurt, sorbet, or frozen drinks. It has been a great item that we have used all summer. When the kids in the family were around we used it to make all types of ice cream. It was a lot of fun to make them their own flavor, and then when the adults were around we made some amazing frozen drinks. Chocolate chips, chopped fruit, nuts, and other ingredients added to the mix make for a great treat. Whole lot better that store bought. Think of it like buying vege's from the store vs. your garden. Also a Recipe booklet included.

I've shaved with an electric razor for years and have used Remington's for many of them.  For the past 10 years I have used other brands: Braun, Wahl, and Norelco, for example.

Dissatisfied with the closeness I experienced with the other brands, I purchased the Remington MS2-390.  While it is a little noisy, the closeness  is unsurpassed. Because it does shave so close, it may be a bit irritating for those who are first time electric users; thus, may take some getting used to.  As for me, it's perfect.  I recommend it highly.

I installed the D-Link DNS-323 NAS a week ago and have moved about 200GB of data onto it by now.  It has been completely reliable.  It was easy to install and setup.  The Group/User setup is not very flexible because a user can only be part of one group, I think.  But setting up shares and defining the network security setup is great and works fine.  The printer server works with no setup at all, very convenient.  Copying data onto the NAS is kinda slow compared to copying from PC to PC on a gigabit LAN but all-in-all it does what it is advertised to do very well.  The memeo auto backup software works very well too.  Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase and think the product is a great deal for the money.

First impression of it is how small it is. I had read reviews and knew that it was small, but this thing can EASILY fit in your pocket and is shorter than a soda can!! 



PROS:

-Very fun to use

-EXTREMELY comfortable to hold (mesh on inside of hand strap instead of leather makes it really comfortable to hold for hours), also fits the shape of your hand really well

-Menu is very similar to other recent (last few years) Canon camcorders and it's easy to navigate

-Better quality

-Good zoom (although surprisingly slower than previous Canons, not by much though)

-Blinding LED light!!

-No motor noise!


CONS:

-Good luck figuring out how to use the .MOD files in WMM (Windows Movie Maker)...
After hours of endless research I decided to go with the $30 Movavi Video Converter [...].
Unless you can understand codecs and everything else there is to simply converting these files to non-MPEG 2 format, there's no free software that can do this (or if there is, let me know...) unless it's some trial version. I had tried [...], but that takes forever for each clip and doesn't even put out very good quality.

-Lots of 'noise' inside, even if room is well lit

-Cannot take pics while recording video (as was possible with my previous MiniDV camcorder, the Canon ZR830)

-Editing software with camcorder is pretty much useless, although it may not seem so at first. It's only for VERY limited editing (maybe cut a bit here or there, but that's it) and just putting all the files together. Probably is a bit worse than WMM even (is that possible??)


I would definitely recommend buying this camcorder if you can find it for about [...] or less. Only reason I didn't give it 5 out of 5 stars is due to the .MOD file issue. (IF you only plan to get video and leave it in a folder somewhere on your computer, then ignore the entire file extension issue and get this camcorder.)

I like it, but not as much as my 7526 synchro that I had to replace. It is a little bulky compared to it. I'm not sure if the 10K vibes thing really does anything or not. The travel case is kind of a joke and is only for the shaver not the the shaver and the power cord.  Was it worth the over $200 I paid, probably not so it better last me four to five years. I like that it can be rinsed out under the water and the battery and hygiene display that tells you when it needs a full clean. Also that you can do a short clean or a long clean is nice compared to my old syncro.

I'd seen many glowing recommendations for this keyboard, and since I moved to a very dark part of the office, I decided to pick one up on impulse. I certainly don't regret the decision- it actually makes typing quite fun. 

The Eclipse 2 is clearly a well-built piece of hardware. It looks and feels solid and impressive, the backlight is attractive and functional (has 3 colors, if you feel like changing) and the keys are both quiet and have a very nice feel. It also has a detachable palm rest that serves the purpose well. About the only possible complaints I can see with the device are that the folding feet don't elevate it very high, and the lighting is not uniform across the board (seems largely centered on the main board, not much gets to the keypad). This hasn't bothered me overmuch.

So, why not the top rating for it then? The main problem is pricing- the Eclipse 2 is nearly as expensive as a Logitech G15, which I also own and use at home. However, the G15 has a lot of additional functionality with its 18 programmable macro keys, supporting software, LCD, etc. My general opinion is as follows: the G15 is clearly better for a hardcore gamer or someone that uses a lot of macros. Its lighting is also a bit brighter, but it only has 2 brightness settings rather than the Eclipse's variable dimmer. It also has two USB ports built-in, which is somewhat useful (though the board eats up so much power they can barely run mice). The Eclipse is more compact and generally easier to move around. Its lighting looks cooler (the G15 only does blue) and the keys have a better feel. I would say it's better for everyday use and non-gaming activities like word processing. 

The only problem in that assessment is that I suspect most Eclipse buyers are gamers. Additionally, Logitech just put out the G11, which is pretty much the same cost as the Eclipse and has all the G15's functionality minus the LCD screen. I must admit, if the store I'd went to had stocked a G11 as well, I'd probably have gotten one. However, I still like this keyboard for office use, even if it might be a bit expensive and overkill for such purposes.

I chose this Cuisinart GR-4 machine after enjoying the paninis made on a friend's simple Breadman device.  While the Breadman worked perfectly well, I felt that the three control knobs (grill temperature, grill/griddle on/off selector, and grill/panini thermostat) were very important.  Further, the ease of cleaning due to the removable plates has been a major advantage.  None of the other devices had this combination of features, including the truly massive Breville.

I have not had an opportunity to use the machine in the open griddle position, so cannot comment on it other than noting that it does open out flat as advertised and does so with no difficulty.

Like any such device, it must be allowed plenty of time to reach the proper operating temperature.  The plates are heavy enough to take some time to heat up, but that also means better performance due to less temperature fluctuation. 

The one significant downside to it, shared with all such panini grills, is that the exterior steel does get dangerously hot - the handle is the only safe place for your hands. That said, I have enjoyed excellent results in the two weeks I have had it.  Elegant panini sandwiches, quesadillas, and pedestrian grilled cheese have been consistently good - and the cleanup is really quite simple.

The device is solidly built, nicely finished, and of quite substanial weight (which is a plus for stability and paninis).  The stainless steel and black trim look very handsome and should complement virtually any kitchen decor.

Highly recommended.

This is a great product. Resolution of the screen is great - very clear and vibrant. Screen is just big enough to watch videos or even a movie on a plane. The only downside that I found was having to buy a new charger for it. It wasn't expensive, but would have liked to not have to buy a new product just to charge my ipod. The shake to shuffle feature is stupid. Sometimes it works, but at other times it doesn't. I've noticed that the backlight on the screen has to be on in order for it to work. It also sometimes is so sensitive that it will shuffle when dropping it into your pocket. However, you can turn this off. It's easier to just hit the advance button. Also, when you turn this ipod on it's side, it automatically activates coverflow. Some people find this annoying because they want to manipulate the volume of the ipod in their pocket, but can't if coverflow is activated. This can be turned off as well. Just go to settings>general>Rotate>turn off. Now it won't be activated unless you want it to via the music menu screen. All in all this is a great product. I love it. Works great and is very slim. Holds a lot of songs, videos, etc. Added features are kind of unnecessary. Apple needs to come up with something better (than shake to shuffle for example).

I enjoy the Native American story line in this series, finally a look at life as a Native in a fun and contemporary setting that I will be able to share with my kids. But I have to admit, I am not a fan of how selfish, needy, and love torn the main character, Bella, is written. She is not a strong character, but in this book she begins to develop a healthier relationship with Jacob, a character I love. Jacob is underserved and not presented in  realistic manner as a 16 year-old shape shifter. The fantasy part to the vampires and werewolves deserves more than the unbelievably annoying and over-exaggerated, hard-to-believe character development of that Bella, Jacob, and the father (Charlie) are given. Other than that I enjoyed this book better than the others because of the presence of Jacob and his family!

My cat has drinking issues, so I was looking for a fountain to try (again). I have tried other fountains without success. My 19 year old kitty Papaya has renal failure, and gets subcutaneous fluids daily. I bought this fountain today, and when I first set it up, I was surprised how noisy it was. Then I moved it upstairs, plugged it in up there, and it is really quiet (I am not sure why, so if noise is an issue for you, try it in a different spot). Within 5 minutes my cat was drinking from this!
This is a cat who screams at all hours when he is thirsty, and will not drink on his own. He must be petted the entire time he is drinking. Now, with the Drinkwell Platinum, so far he is drinking by himself, which he has not done in months!!!

I absolutely Love the little mermaid! When I was a wee bit of a baby, my mom had to buy 2 videos because I'd watch them over and over.

It's so great, I think this is defenitely disney at it's best!I can't wait for Disney's Platinum Edition for this movie. All the special features, I just keep counting the days. I just hope, they make it as spectacular as the Original Release!!! The generation of kids right now, may only know LILO AND STITCH, but they will know later of the Real Classics, like THE LITTLE MERMAID!

Next to my Family Guy box sets this is the best purchase I have made in 12 months.  

Tired of my wife busting balls on a daily basis, I needed something to take care of the whiskers.  This fantastic tool takes care of that for you leaving absolutely no mess on the bathroom counter.  I travel a lot for work and this tool is small enough to fit in my travel medicine bag along with my standard razor.  I just purchased this for my brother in law and will also purchase it for a buddy's birthday.

Overall this is a great mouse.  It feels really good in you hand (if you right handed).  I really love the weight system it is easy to change and can give you any desired feel.  Changing the sensitivity on the fly is also very helpful as it allows you to easily transition between normal use or gaming.

I used to have a MS FF driving wheel, and had to replace it because my new PC didn't have a "game port".  So I bought this one, hoping that it would at least be as good as my old one (it was OK, the clamp didn't work that great, and the pedals were always moving).

Well, it works great!  I use the pedals on a hardwood floor and they don't move at all.  The clamps for the wheel is a little odd to figure out at first (two of the clamps are hidden by the grey cover on top, which isn't obvious that it's removable).  But once you get all three clamped down, it doesn't move at all (I do have a thick wood and formica office desk to clamp it to though).  The carpet anchor on the pedals seems like it would work very well, it might stick down too far for shorter carpeting, but you might not even need it for that type of carpet.

I didn't think I'd like or want the extra shifter on the base, preferring to use just the paddle shifters, but it's quite nice.  I play GTR FIA GT, and it works as a fantastic brake bias adjuster!  Also the force feedback seems much more realistic than MS's wheel was.  It's not as significant, and more consistent.  MS's wheel it seemed to be way too much feedback, so I usually played with FF off, but this is very nice to use.  The motors and the gearing are obviously plastic, but I couldn't find any wheels that weren't, so I'm not sure why people mention that in reviews.  Yes, I'd love to have one that was made from metal, but I'm not sure if I'd want to pay twice as much for it.

I only really have two complaints.  The first is it's size, it's big.  Bigger than the MS wheel, but since it's performance is better, and now that I don't have a CRT anymore, there's plenty of room.  If you have a smaller desk, or a larger CRT, you should measure to see if it will work for you!  The second is that damn removable panel for the front two clamps.  It's pretty stupid that they hide the clamp adjusters, and since I'm constantly putting it on and taking it off, I just leave the cover off (supposedly you're supposed to remove it to clamp and unclamp the wheel).  Fortunately the wheel doesn't look that bad when the cover is off.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)

      



As a "new" (actually rediscovered, having formerly used Mac systems at various times along the way, some versions of the Mac much longer than others, but enough to have previous experience) Mac user I looked forward to seeing what sort of experience Microsoft really delivers to users of that 'other' operating system.  Certainly Microsoft has seen themselves poked fun of by the Mac vs. Vista TV commercials enough that a Microsoft product manager might have to ask themselves whether or not it really makes sense to release their products on the competing platform.

There are other ways of running Office on the Mac platform, including running in virtual machines/emulators and the like, but those methods just don't give a Mac user the native Mac experience and environment and many Mac users would reject the idea of anything less than a full-fledged Mac product anyway.  Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac gives Mac users that full-fledged Mac experience by delivering current versions of the standard Office suite: Power Point, Word, Excel and Entourage (think "Outlook" if you are a PC user) and even Messenger for Mac.

Rather than bore readers of this review with lots of information that Amazon has conveniently listed on the product page, I'd like to take a few seconds to speak to issues and frustrations that users might experience and places where Microsoft could hopefully make some improvements along the way.

First, props (congratulations, praise, etc.) to Microsoft for a smooth installation process.  Pop in the DVD disc, run the installer and zoom, you're on the way to having Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac installed.  That said, I miss the level of customization that was offered in the Office 2004 install process.  Not that the level of control for the custom install isn't complete enough, but with earlier versions the level of (granularity in) control was seemingly much greater than what is now offered. Regardless, the installation process was relatively smooth and pretty well idiot proof until...  ah, there had to be an until didn't there ;-)

Yup, at the end of the install it was time to update the product.  Anyone that has dealt with any Microsoft product knows to expect to have to update and patch the products.  Office for the Mac is no exception in this area.  Unfortunately, the update process on the Mac, at least when someone is working on installing SP1 for Office 2008, is far from perfect and could trip up an average user.  Just in following through the installation and jumping into updating the product I was offered an update that would install SP1 for Office 2008 which I choose to attempt to install.  Note I said attempt.  The installation never completed properly when using the AutoUpdater, instead I had to go and manually download the service pack and then install it using a manual process.  Once that was done, then I was able to use the AutoUpdater again and could finally download the patches that are required *after* SP1 is installed.  With the problem installing SP1 via the AutoUpdater seemingly well known one might expect that Microsoft would have fixed the issue by now, but sadly the problem remains at the time I write this review.

Beyond the install issues with the basic product, there's another nit to pick on the install process for the Microsoft Expression Media features.  Not in the install process really, but in the licensing process for same.  Rather than prompting for licensing of the Expression Media during the install process the licensing is done separately through menu selections that are not all that intuitive.  Anyone can eventually find the proper menu selection to get the task done, but why should someone installing the software really have to go find the menu entries?  Why not offer users the ability to supply the license key during installation as they would with just about any other Microsoft product that they've ever (or would ever) install?

To take that complaint/concern just a little further, purchasers of Microsoft Office: Mac 2008 Special Media Edition for Digital Media Enthusiasts 'with Microsoft Expression Media' can obtain an update to Microsoft Expression Media 2 any time after June 1, 2008 simply by downloading it.  After downloading that material and running the install process you would again be left to figure out what menu selection to use to license the product.  Again, it's not impossible or all that difficult to find, but the menus are changed between the older Expression Media and newer Expression Media 2 so it's not as straight forward as it could be.

Office: Mac 2008 is a nice product but there is still room for improvement all around.  Hopefully continued competition will help push Microsoft to keep making the product better.

I purchased my first Omron pedometer at Wal-Mart online for $29.99 and eventually found the pedometer on Amazon for much less.  This is a great pedometer which can be worn or carried in your purse and I purchased two in case I lose one.  It is a bit large (approx. 2 7/8" x 2" or 7.3cm x 5.2cm);I clip it to the band on my underwear and it stays in place very well.  The memory keeps seven days of your walking activity which facilitates tracking your progess easy. The only complaint I have is the plastic clip on the lanyard breaks easily;I have broken two of them. I suggest the manufacturer finds a more durable plastic to manufacture the lanyard clip or provide a means to buy replacement clips at a very low price.

This toaster goes great with my kitchen. It works well as a toaster and the egg thing works good too. I don't use the egg part as much because I'm always cooking more than two eggs but for cooking two or one egg, its's great! I love how it has the buttons that allow you to cancel toasting something, toast, toast and egg, or just egg. This is a great toaster for your kitchen or a great gift to give!

Wow, love this laptop.

Bought it yesterday (in store not on amazon, but i figure i'd help you guys decide on it).

KEYBOARD, I can actually touch type on this keyboard, i tried out the EEEPC and it's keyboard is so small, you'd have to hunt and peck, i would get very frustrated after a few minutes.

SCREEN, is beautiful, it's big, it's bright, it's sharp.  No graininess at all.  I like the glossy screen, glares a bit, but looks sharp as hell.  The size is perfect for viewing web pages, movies, and my favorite game: Jagged Alliance 2.

CASE, The build quality is great.  The laptop feels solid, has a good heft to it without being heavy, and is sized well.  The glossy case leads to fingerprints, but still looks great.  I mean come on, even the iphone gets fingerprints on it, not a big concern in my book.

CAMERA, works great, picture quality is great, i was expecting a pixilated mess but it was clear and good enough for webcam video.

NOISE & HEAT, Not loud at all, had it transferring files, running video, never really heated up or was loud.  I was actually impressed on how quiet it was.  Perhaps if i run some CPU heavy processes all the time i would worry but let's face it, hardly anyone is going to encode video or do any cpu heavy applications on this.

TOUCHPAD, The touchpad is accurate enough, though i believe this is the only weak point of the One.  The mouse buttons on the side are a pain in the arse, and they are below the level of the track pad, making the button difficult to find sometimes. There is no type of boarder around the track pad so sometimes you'll run off the area.  And it's a bit small, this in no way was a deal breaker for me, worse comes to worse if i do mouse heavy things i will just pick up a logitech mx mini mouse or something similar.

POWER BRICK, this is the only qualm i have with the laptop.  With such an amazingly small and portable laptop, why would they have such a large bundle of wires for the power brick?  It's big and cumbersome and there is really no way to bundle it up efficiently.  I wish it were more like the macbook powerbrick, but then again, i wasn't expecting much from such a low priced laptop.


In the end, you have to evaluate how you will use this.  If your intent is to fill the void between your home computer, and cell phone, it is an awesome laptop.  The great keyboard and screen make it very useful to do everything from web surfing to word processing, You can even fit some ripped movies and games on there.  For the price, in the subnotebook market, you get the best bang for your buck.

The pan for poaching the egg is junk. The Teflon?or whatever non stick coating peeled off after a couple of uses. That's nasty. I took a Brillo?pad and scrubbed every bit of the non stick coating off the pan. Now I love the machine. One time I ate 3 in a row. I paid for that later, but it was worth it. I haven't used any of the other stuff on it, just the english muffin with a poached egg. It tasted like the way a Mc Muffin?used to taste. I think McDonalds?makes them in China now, then ships them to the U.S. and then heats them up in a dirty microwave when you order it. I could be wrong about that though, I'm just guessing.

I was hesitant about purchasing the newest generation of ipod nano after reading all the negative reviews, but as it turned out, my son just loves it!!!  I told him I had the receipt and we could send it back if he wanted after checking it out, but he had no complaints.  It works great, he loves the built in accelerometer, the shake to shuffle feature.  And since he owns a macbook, charging the ipod nano is no problem.  My only regret is that I didn't purchase the 16gb.

I'm impressed with the whole experience of creating and publishing a video the Flip allows.  Bottom line: it makes publishing a video on YouTube easy enough more people will do it, and people will publish more videos with it than without it.  If you shoot in a bunch of light, get close to the camera for audio and minimize movement of camera or subject, the quality is quite good; very acceptable for YouTube.  I think this MAY do for "citizen video" what the ipod did for listening to music.  Buy one and start using it.

After doing extensive research I decided to purchase the KitchenAid Pro 600. I was deciding between a few brands (KitchenAid, DeLonghi, Viking). I chose the KitchenAid for its value, durability, and great reviews. Seeing it in several bakeries sealed the deal for me.

This was my first stand mixer. One of the smartest purchases I've made. I love it. I love it. I love it. It's powerful, easy to clean, and very easy to operate. I've only owned it for a few months. So far I've used it for for mixing cake batters, cookie batters, and buttercreams. I've yet to use it for heavier batters such as bread. It's stood the test for mixing a large amount of cookie batters. 

Contrary to other reviews, I think it's very quiet. Looking forward to creating more delicious desserts with my Kitchenaid mixer.

Buying my first external hard drive, I was a little worried about purchasing this WD Elements 1TB.  The other reviews were very helpful and I am glad I bought it.  The shipping was a little bit slow, but I was in no rush.  The drive itself is a bit slow, but I have a lot of patience.  I immediately took it out of the package and read the very limited literature.  After reviewing the rest of the comments about FAT32 vs. NTFS, I formatted it to NTFS, so I can't compare the speed of this.  I did put over 5 Gig of music on the drive and it took about 48 minutes.  I am not sure if that is par for the course. It's very rugged and not a lot of bells and whistles.  I can put a boat load of pics, video, and music.  Great machine for the price.

This not just one excellent, original show CBS has cancelled. By count this is at least number two in the very recent history. It seems as though in order to be a successful series on CBS, the letters "CSI" must be tacked on somewhere in the title of the show.  Jericho was one of the best shows on when it was cancelled not once, as painful as that was but twice.

I cannot say enough about the show MOONLIGHT. It was original in the way it showed that being a vampire is not all good as some shows have attemped to show.  You lose all your loved ones, at some point you have to end relationships/friendships because the lack of aging cannot be explained. The relationship between Mick and Beth was shown with sensitivity, and the yearning that only a relationship with these complications can be no matter how much they love each other.

I am more disapointed this show has been cancelled, as much as any other, in the years I have watched television.
GO, CSI MOONLIGHT AND CSI JERICHO!!

I have a small portable usb dvd which works with this so I can use it like a little dvd player.  All in all, it's a great little machine with lots of uses, but won't take the place of a "real" laptop.  I love it!

It bears repeating =0) I am a mom with two young girls (4 & 1)so I cannot be  a religious waxer no matter how much I love the effect/convenience.  This ingenious handheld has answered my prayers; Simplicity and ease... and it get the job done! Yes it takes me approx a half hr but that includes my shower, so I do not mind.  

Ok, so it is not completely painless and it does carry a bit of a sting, if you are not used to the pull from the tiny tweezers, especially where the hair is coarse.  I suggest, to ease up the bite, you stretch any loose skin taut when gliding the epilator over it; and also for me the highest setting causes the least amount of irritation(if any).

But, truly this removes the hair safely and easily and I discovered that if my skin got caught by mistake the device immediately shut off, so as to avoid ANY cuts or scrapes... WOW!  Could you imagine what a mess if it didn't?!  And I didn't even think to check for that... thank God! 

It really IS the BEST hair remover I have EVER used... EVER!!! And as a mom and wife who is in the process of packing to relocate to another country, let me just say... to not worry about looking unkempt where shaving is concerned for a couple weeks and keeping an expensive appointment?  HAHAHA,  That's one huge worry off my mind - now if only I could get Braun to invent something for the rest of my other day-to-day inconveniences.....

Two years ago, I bought new mattresses . . . and splurged on those really thick "Princess and the Pea" mattresses that (unfortunately) have to have sheets with really deep pockets.  Since then, I've been on a mission to procure sheets that not only feel fabulous but also actually fit my monstrous mattresses.  

I've purchased numerous sets of sheets that 'claimed' to be deep pocket sheets ("fit up to 18" thick mattresses!"), but have met only dissappointment with all but one of the sheet sets I've purchased.  In the past, the sheets that I've bought have either just barely fit the mattresses (and came off during the night) or they fit OK but weren't very soft and comfortable to sleep under.  

BUT when I got these sheets home (which were quite reasonably priced, I might add), I was VERY pleasantly surprised to learn that they not only FIT my mattresses (with room to spare -- the elastic goes WAY up under the mattresses so no chance of them 'popping' off) but they are also SILKY smooth to the touch right out of the package and seem to get even softer with each washing!  

I'm doing the happy dance right now!

I got this from Amazon for a few dollars less than retail, which is always nice. I saw it at Safeway the other day for about $20, and even at that price, I think it's well worth it. Nobody likes brushing their teeth. It's just one of those little chores that has to be done, and with the Precision Clean Power Toothbrush, it's not such a chore. It's very efficient and cleans the teeth faster than a conventional brush. AND, the head is so small, you can reach into those little nooks and crannies and between the teeth more effectively, and that is really nice. My teeth feel cleaner and I am more motivated to do this little chore several times a day. I think it's a great product.

WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW******

Are you kidding me with these 1 star reviews? I am not sure what expectations people wanted SM to meet. People are angry because she gave the characters a happy ending- because she chose not to kill one off or to leave one bitter and miserable? She had Bella craving sex too often...she has Jacob imprint on an infant...her message was too happy for teen girls...am I missing something here in the endless babbles of negativity?

A 1 star book denotes poor writing and a book that you really can't get through...I am sure many of you couldn't put it down (even if you were disappointed)...be a little bit more mature with the ratings...

This book had so many expectations and you can never make anyone truly happy...SM had to conclude the Twilight saga and I think she did pretty well with the characters...so what if Bella never had to pay for her poor choices or that Jacob didn't end up in a ball of misery...it is a work of FICTION after all and she gave them a happy ending...it's not the crime of the century and I think based on many of her interviews, it was clear she was an optimisitc woman who wasn't going to end the story on a sour note...

And since when do we object to happy endings? And why should SM be responsible for passing on morality to young girls (isn't that the parents responsibility?). I don't believe SM claimed she was making a statement for young girls to follow. This story was always SM's creation and as far as I'm concerned, she gave the characters the ending she saw fit...

Bella and Edward had to be together at the end...and while I objected at first to the pregnancy angle, I really grew to love that perspective once the baby was born...it completed Bella and it completed her relationship with Edward...and since Jacob was bound to end up a member of the family anyway, it made sense for him to imprint on the baby...and when I read that, I never once thought of it as some perverted and sick scenario...I think the readers are making it so...SM was clear that if a werewolf imprinted on an infant or child, it wasn't sexual at that age...just a deep love and instinct to protect them and make them happy...I think the people who are freaking on this angle are the sick ones!!

And Bella is featured as a mature girl...Bella was stated as being much more mature than even her own mother...why would it surprise anyone that she was thrilled to be pregnant? That baby was a creation of love between her and Edward...a lasting declaration of their love (remember Renee saying that once Bella made up her mind, she was very decisive and firm in choices?)...and also, when you have known any newly married couple to not experiment with sex on a honeymoon? Isn't that the point of a honeymoon anyway? And when Bella was made a vampire, it was like she saw Edward clearly for the 1st time with new eyes. Their love was bonded deeper than as a human- of course she would crave intimacy with her husband (someone who couldn't be free with her until that exact transformation)...goodness, give the characters a break!!

I think some are using a bias against SM and that creates negativity when reading the book...take it as it is- a work of fiction that concluded on a high note with characters that are not meant to be taken so literally...I am sure some people feel that they have some Bella, Edward, Alice, Jacob, etc. in them, but they are not real people!! No one said they had to be perfect or adhere to some high moral standard...

So read the book with an open mind and appreciate it as the last book of this series (well- we still have Midnight Sun)...if you keep your mind closed to the story, then you will hate it...but I was able to push my own negative vibes out and by the end of the book, I loved it!!

I just  love the  twilight saga  they are  the books that  I have read in along time she has you on the edge of your set  the hole time I mean after you  are done reading  you are still thinking about it . That is a great book.  But I did  just find out that she put her book Midnight sun on hold and that she might NEVER put it out I think that is the most terrible news . I have looked up every were to write to her and there is nothing  I hope she changes her mind and let Edward have his side come out. All I keep thinking we heard Bella's side lets hear Edwards let him have a voice of his own. I guess I am writing this on here thinking maybe she will see it and know how much her books means to us all.

I bought this mouse because I used it once at a local gaming store and it was very nice and accurate.  I recently had a Logitech MX518 which was a very nice gaming mouse and just falls short in my opinion to this Razer DeathAdder.  The name pretty much describes this mouse.  I am playing Call of Duty World at War, and the shooting is so accurate I hardly miss.  I have a logitech gaming mouse and a Razer Barracuda headset and they all light up the exact same blue, it looks pretty cool.  Buy this mouse for sure!

I looked into all types of gates. This one was the best choice for us as we needed the adjuster knobs for an uneven space. This one also came with an additional panel for wider doorways where for other gates, I would have had to purchase it. I bought this 5 months ago to keep our puppy in the kitchen but now it keeps my 8 month old son out! It is so easy to use with one hand. Will be buying another one for our stairwell.

Sanyo SK-VF7S Digital Convection Oven, Stainless Steel Finish
This toaster-oven is replacing a series of Black and Decker and other toaster-ovens which each lasted about 4 months before either burning out an element (2) or the failing of internal electrical connections (1).  The size is just right for a 4 slice toaster, and the toast actually comes out evenly browned, instead of having over- or under-done areas.  The electronic controls are a pleasure to use, and the only noise is a quiet whir of the convecton fan (no ticking timer).  The baking function works very well with the provided temperature and time settings.  The 5 temperature options should be adequate for any type of planned baking or reheating use.  The oven rack that automatically slides out when the door is opened is a great feature. Finally, the stainless steel finish does show some fingerprinting, but cleans up easily enough.
This is the first product review I have ever written in my 73 years, but I am really impressed by this Sanyo product.

I am happy with the product. My only complaint is that the bottle did not come in the original package, just the bottle.  It was sealed though and did not appear tampered with in any way.  The original package contains information to gain access to the website, so this was a little annoying.  I contact the distributor, and they said they do not receive the bottle in the original package, which made me a little leery.  I then had to contact Alli customer service and explain the situation and they provided me the access code needed to get to the website.  All in all, I am very happy with the product and have already seen positive change.  I would definitely but it again, since amazon has the best prices I have found.

Weight loss is simple. You must take in less calories than you need or in other words burn more calories than you consume. The GoWear calculates the amount of calories you burn and you can track how many you eat. Thru the website you imput what you eat over a three day period and it uses this data for your caloric consumption.

It is like wearing a personal trainer. You set a goal of how many calories you want to burn thru physical activity and it keeps track of how many calories you are burning, the number of steps you have taken, your exercise time as well as your sleep time. 

I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it to a friend.

I started out with an old, predominantly plastic juicer, but promptly gave it away because of the unbearable noise, vibrations and wet pulp.  Next I bought the very favorably reviewed Hamilton Beach Big Mouth juicer.  It was a good value for the money, but I still found it too noisy (though quieter than my previous cheap plastic juicer) and the pulp still too wet.  Then I noticed the Breville Ikon, and had debated for a very long time whether I should spend three times the money to buy a juicer that might work a little better.  I finally couldn't resist when I saw the Ikon on sale and bought one. 

The result:  I am now much happier.  Even though the Hamilton Beach and the Breville juicers are constructed rather similarly, the Ikon is quieter, and does extract more juice from my fruits and veggies.  There are still bits of fruits and veggies in the pulp bin, but the pulp is overall dry enough. I have now finally found the juicer that can meet my expectations.

How much money to spend on a juicer is a personal choice.  To me, being able to find a relatively quiet juicer that is juice efficient is a priority, and I feel that I have found what I want.

This little PC is just amazing!!  I had been watching this product since before the holiday season just to see if the price would drop or if new models would be release either before/after CES.   My original hesitation about the purchase was the keyboard.   I can honestly say that the first few hours were really really bad.   It was quite frustrating to learn where the keys are on a small keyboard.  However, after just setting up the PC and doing some surfing I found myself flying on the keyboard.

The shipping OS, a modified version of Xandros, was actually quite good.  Anything that you could want is on there and adding additional programs was really easy. I kept it for about a day and played with the easy and advanced versions before making the move to a custom installation of Ubuntu.   

Overall the hardware is really amazing.  It has more than enough power to run all of the cool desktop effects that come packaged in Compiz-fusion.  As soon as receiving the PC, I upgraded the memory to 1GB and added a Kingston 4GB SD card.   

Like everyone has mentioned, you will get looks and asked what it is.  It is a lot of fun to explain to them what it is and then when they ask price to see their face.  Most of them think it costs much much more that what you pay.   

My only concern is about the product walking off.   I take it to class everyday in my laptop bag.  I use to just leave my bag on my chair when I would go and talk with other students or the professor.  However, now that everyone knows that I have one and seeing the reaction towards it, I have a hard time letting it out of my sight.

Overall this is the best $400 I have ever invested into a PC.

I brought my machine 3 days ago, at the begining it didn't work out as great, more milk shake than ice cream consistency.  Later I found out, freezing the bowl 24 hours isn't enough. First you have to make sure you whip the heavy cream, milk and sugar into a smooth texture. Than you have to put the batter of cream into a tight container and put it in the frig  for a 2-3 hours. Make sure it not in there for you long that it gets frozen, afterward transfer the batter into the machine and around 10 mins the ice cream will turn to a med firm consistency. I recommend freeze your ice cream for another hour, or else it will still melt pretty fast.
And wa-la you get store brought ice cream quality or even better.

I was very hesitant to jump over to the mac, being a pc user all my life, but I am so glad I did. It is very easy for me to suffer buyers remorse over a major purchase. Many times items don't live up to my expectations. With this purchase my expectations were exceeded. This computer is fantastic and the Leopard OS is awesome. It truly worked right out of the box and has all the simplicity of a plug and play device.
    I have the white, 2.4Ghz, 2GB, 160Hd mac. The screen is beautiful, bright, crisp and colorful. The keyboard is just that with handy function keys that jump to the things I need. The track pad with the two finger scrolling is a very functional and handy feature. From the built in camera to the magnetic closing lid, it just feels like a well and solidly built computer.
    I am just beginning to scratch the surface as to what the Leopard OS can do. This is a family computer that will be used for family things: Photos, movies, music, email and the like. Whatever application I do play around with, I find different things that make the entire computing experience enjoyable and fun. I can't wait to pick up Leopard for dummies and discover all the tricks this thing can do. (Like writing this review)
    This computer made me write my very first review because I am so pleased with my purchase. It costs a bit more than some of those "deals" I see in the paper but so far seems well worth it. 
PS. Thanks Amazon for dropping it off on my doorstep a day after I ordered it with Amazon prime!

I typically don't write reviews on products but I just had to here as I am very happy with this product and wish to share it with others. I bought the Omega Paw in the large size at a Petsmart after doing some pretty extensive research. I presently have 5 cats ranging in size from very large to dainty. I've tried pretty much every type of cat litter pan on the market--the basic square pan, sifter types, covered and uncovered all the way up to the high tech automatic electric models. I'm kind of a sucker for gagets but I'm always looking for the best deal for the performance. This product gets the big paws up for both. 
I hate to even go into the cost involved in buying electric models which last about as long as it takes you to pay for them (maybe less time than that in some cases) and how they are a big mess to deal with (literally). The motors which drive them are pretty much the same ones you can get in a child's tinker toy kit--yes I've taken them apart and replaced, cleaned, glued, re-drilled and oiled parts in order to get a little more life out of more than one dying electro-potty and no company stands behind their products once you leave the store with it. Just try buying a basic part from littermaid--forget it and yeah right, I'm going to pack up the cat potty and send it back to the manufacturer for repairs.
After trying the omega paw and seeing that it actually performed as stated with virtually no moving parts, very easy to clean--no scooping, saves you a ton of money as well as keeps my cats healthy and happy--I was sold. The drawbacks of the product aren't really worth complaining about in my opinion. If you are careful putting it together and don't try to take it out for some kind of crash test, it's very durable. As for the space it takes up?--just try an electric model--once you've spread one of those puppies out, stored all of the special containers and filters, plugged it in and propped up and clamped a couple of easily worn out broken pieces; while the super glue is drying you'll be better able to appreciate the simplicity and the compactness of the Omega paw design. Thanks.

Pampers and Huggies are, in our opinion, the best diaper brands out there. We have a slightly preference for Pampers because they look less "bulky" on the baby, compared to Huggies or store brands. And it is the best deal I have for diapers, considering the 15% discount from Amazon "Subscribe & Save" program. However, I've noticed that the diaper is no longer available as a "Subscribe & Save" item, so I am not sure whether I would buy it for the full price - I would have to compared unit costs using my spreadsheet to see if it is worth it.

Have used it as a repository for back-ups (via ShirtPocket's SuperDuper) of 2 internal Mac G4 drives and 1 external firewire drive-- it's still just a few months old-- but it worked efficiently and unobtrusively. The black high-gloss finish reminds me of a beautiful black mirror. Set-up was effortless. All that's needed is for LaCie is to make icons of it available. Bought it from JR Music after it went out of stock with Amazon. No free shipping but it came out cheaper even with shipping.

I bought the EC-BD15 about a year ago to replace another worn out stainless brewer (a Melitta).  It makes great coffee and the red LED clock readout is bright and easy to read, but there are a couple things I don't like:

1] The stopper or "carafe cover" needs to be lined up perfectly under the spout, or hot coffee will spill past the center opening and on top of the cover.  Sometimes it spills over the carafe onto the countertop; as long as you're CAREFUL setting this up it won't leak.

2] The carafe cover on my Zojirushi developed a leak after a couple months of daily use, and now coffee is sloshing around the dead space inside the hollow plastic; definately a sanitation concern.  I've contacted the company to see if they will replace it.

3] The included carafe itself isn't well insulated, coffee goes cool after a scant 30 minutes or so; I usually pour the first cup or two then transfer the rest into another vacuum bottle carafe.  In that vessel it stays hot for several hours.

4] The instruction manual calls for using #4 cone filters, but they don't quite fit as they're too large.  I have to crease the filters about 1/4" in from their inside crimps, then they fit MUCH better.  A nuisance, but I tolerate it.

It's cool to own a Zojirushi product, but this coffeemaker isn't one of their best ideas.

This is much better and safer than using a credit card. My only complaint is they don't have discount versions when you buy for several months. Why buy six cards a year? Instead have a six month and a year card for a discounted price. The game is a blast and I am glad they have these for me to use or to buy as gifts for friends and family that play the game. These cards are at most stores that carry computer games. They can be easily purchased but the price does vary. So shop around the internet and brick and mortar stores. Amazon prices are competitive and I like to order them and have them delivered to my door.

I read the reviews on here before I purchased the product and was hesitant but decided to order anyway because of a lack of alternatives.

My cat was crying incessantly for me to feed him periodically through the day starting at between 3-4AM. This was taking a toll on both myself and my husband. Due to weight, I had to control portions so I could not just leave out an unlimited supply of food.

I have been extremely pleased with the product. To dispute a few of the complaints I read from other users, my husband programmed the timer and he said it was not difficult if you followed the directions. Also, both the hopper and the lid have a locking mechanism to keep kitties from knocking it over and releasing the food.

I no longer have to listen to my cat cry and beg for food all day. He no longer runs to the bathroom (where is food is) everytime I start in that direction. He knows the food comes from the feeder now and not from me.

Bottom line, I highly recommend this product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I got this hard drive for a photography class. I wanted something that did not require an external power brick, so I could bring it with me. The drive works great (so far) and is instantly recognized by anything I plug it into. I've plugged this drive into 3 different computers. One runs vista, one runs xp and the third was an apple running os x, all preformed well. I also plugged it into my ps3 and my xbox 360. Both consoles recognized the drive, however the ps3 needs the media folders to be labeled correctly for the media to be accessed. I had my images in a folder named "pictures", the ps3 would like the folder to be labeled "photos".
I did buy a hard case for the drive also, but thats just because I'm exceptionally hard on my stuff.

I have two cats and had two litter boxes. I was tired of cleaning out each one with a scoop - especially when one cat decided to make it habit to urinate in the same spot and not cover it up, making it one, big, soggy mess. Got this new litterbox and loved it from the start. Sure, it seems a little bit lightweight, but that's good because you're literally picking the thing up and rolling it on the floor. I haven't had any issues with litter spillage from the sides and I put more litter in by simply tilting the entire box back slightly - no need to remove the top until I need to completely clean it. I've replaced both of those previous boxes with just this one and both cats love it, too.

Wall-E is great entertainment.  It is a funny movie for both adults and children -- the perfect movie to take children or grandchildren to see.  

The use of minimal dialogue is a challenge to the viewer.  With the limited facial expressions available, the makers of this movie did an amazing job of conveying the plot and the emotions.

The obese people were a sad insightful comment on our eating and exercise efforts.  It affected me!  I had a low-calorie salad for breakfast!

I have two negative comments about the movie.  One is that the message seems to be that human beings are ruining the earth.  I think placing this message in a children's movie is a cheap shot.  This bad feature is redeemed in the conclusion by the return of humanity with an effort to green the planet.  

The other is that the movie tended to drag after the half-way mark. I had the feeling that more plot or less time would have helped. The redundancy of the action placed our eyeballs on a treadmill while our bodies sat and watched the fat people watch their screens.   Maybe I felt that way because the movie motivated me.  I was ready to get up and move.

Despite these problems, it was a good movie, worth going to see.  We had a good laugh.

I just recently purchased my own mixer and I absoulutely love and adore it. I've this mixer numerous times. We bought my mother one for Christmas a few years ago and she loved. So I had to try it out and I can't get enough of it. It is so simple to use, makes baking quite easy. It is quiet, it quick and does not make a mess at all. If I could buy one for everyone I would. I highly recommend this machine. You can't go wrong the price is right and shipping is free! This machine handles it all!Georgina Olson Livermore, CaMother of 4

I got the first generation Syncro shaver cleaning systems when they first came out. I am glad the refill cartridges are the same for the second generation systems. The second generation systems are intelligent enough to automatically decide how intense a cleanning session your shaver needs. I think this also helps conserve the amount of cleaning fluid is used. Another way to make it last longer is not to clean your shaver after every use, but rather just once or twice a week. In between cleanings, or before extended absences, I pull out the refill cartridge and seal it to keep the fluid from evaporating while it is just sitting there. So make sure to save the cap so that you can reseal the cartridge!

For me, the highlight of season 7 was the final break up between Clark and Lana. The writers took Lana's character way out of its role in the Superman universe, which was insignificant in the series to start with. Sure, she was his childhood or a highschool crush. But their constant drama, break ups and getting back together, constant appologies and mistrust made that relationship detestable. I cannot stand Lana Lang anymore. Personally, i think they should've removed her or given her a lesser role after season 4.

Season 7 also has a very dark atmosphere. Lex goes through some interesting "adjustments" that make him a real villain. But Clark, unfortunatelly, doesn't turn into a potential hero. He whines and cries throughout the majority of episodes. I think i can write a thesis on how many times he appologized and said "this is all my fault". Season 8 needs to make a man out of him AND start working on the Clark/Lois relationship. They don't even look like a potential couple, more like buddies who occasionally engage in friendly rivalry. They definatelly need a lot more chemistry.

This does just what it says it does...tons of hair comes out easily with only light strokes.

I can't say that my cat tolerates it better than the other brushes I use, but it certainly does a better job.

I haven't used it on the labrador yet, but I'm expecting the same results.  It's a great tool for the money...just one trip to the groomers with my cat cost me $50.00; and their results were extremely disappointing.

I'm very pleased with this product. It seems to be well constructed (all stainless inside and out except for handle and lid, sealed heating element), and heats water plenty fast. My only (minor) complaint is that the cycle done signal is very quiet, just a slight ding, so if you are in another room you will not hear it. It would be nice if it were louder. Fantastic product overall, though. Recommended.

One of these brush heads came with my Oral B 980TX power toothbrush.  I liked it so much more than the regular FlexiSoft head that I immediately ordered the 3-pack.

The extra bristles with their side-to-side oscillation add more oomph to the Oral B's tingle-inducing cleaning action.  I can feel it all the way to the base of each tooth.  When I rinse, I see more loosened debris swirling down the drain.  I finish my morning brushing with a hydrogen peroxide rinse, and, man oh man, does it get foamy, an indication of freshly cleaned dental and gum surfaces.

The price is already a bargain but with additional available discounts like Free Super Saver Shipping, it's a steal.

I'll admit that I read the books (all eight, straight through, and I was not, before this, a 'vampire fiction' sort of reader) after seeing the HBO series, but agree with others who say you need to judge each on its own merits.  I think the books were a blast, but I also loved the series and think trying to stick too close to the books would not have worked well in this medium. I (and several previously non vampire-addicted friends) can't wait for season 2 and hope the dvds have lots of good extras.

Well to start off, about 10 years ago, I bought one of those wired fences that you bury underground.  The problem is, eventually a smart dog figures out that if he runs fast enough, he gets past the wire with barely a shock and then it is next to impossible to get him back.

This setup however is different in that it shocks him until he returns in range of the transmitter (well, up to 30 seconds anyway).  This is a big difference.

Now if you want give your dog acres to run around on, then this is not for you.  I on the other hand just need to keep the dog in the back yard.  I don't want him near the driveway bothering UPS or FEDEX every time they come to deliver a package.  There is more than enough room to keep this 1 year old rottie mutt occupied.  I would estimate about 1/3 - 1/2 an acre is his running area.  It does fluctuate like all radio signals, but not much.  Fortunately the collar emits warning beeps before shocking him.  He figured this out quick and heads towards the house when it beeps.

As for training, well, the manual has it laid out to be a 2 week ordeal.  We found that a few sessions the dog was basically ready.  I didn't care for the training manual.  They basically want you to trick your dog to get shocked.  Example, they mention to go to an off limits area and entice the dog to follow you.  Well, that is just low.  I found just walking him near the flags, saying no, and when he ignores you and gets shocked, shake the flag so he knows.  

We did this over a 24 hour period and then set him loose. Sure, he got zapped a couple times, but figured it out pretty quick.  The training in my opinion should to be basically just to teach him to head towards the house if he gets shocked.

If you have a smart dog, you should not have a problem.  If your dog is dumb as a stump, you might end up just tying him to one.

The documentation wants you to locate this centrally in your home.  I found it better to put it on the side of the house you want your dog on.  In my case, the back right corner of my home.  

I installed this in August and waited until now to post the review.  We just changed the battery yesterday, so about 4 months and this was the same battery used during training so it had a higher usage.  It is possible I would imagine for it to last 6 months.

After moving across the country we ended up with a dentist who has no sense of humor.  Our family doesn't floss much.  The dentist castigated me for this and I said, "But I do floss!  Twice a year!" (meaning that during both of my dental visits the hygientist flosses my teeth).  The dentist and his hygienist were not amused.

So, we got a Water Pik so that next time we go (if we haven't changed dentists by then!) we will be able to tell them we do use it.  It works fine, no problems yet, but I do strongly recommend you put WARM water in it before use.  I tried to cut corners once and use the cold water that was still in it from the morning, and it was like cold needles shooting into my gums!

Seventh Generation likes to disclose all the ingredients they use in their products. That includes their chlorine free diapers which range in sizes newborn to size six. This means that not only are Seventh Generation diapers chlorine free they are also fragrance and latex free as well as being hypo-allergenic. For the mother of a baby with sensitive skin these diapers are heaven sent. 

I'm not going to wax poetic about these diapers despite the fact that I could. I am just going to state plainly why I think they are the best diapers around and deserving of an MPR five star rating. It isn't just because they are a green product either, believe me I have tried my fair share of those and some are not worth any amount of money. I love Seventh Generation diapers above all others for the following- 

1. No chlorine and no fragrances = no diaper rash. Ever. If I happen to run out and need to use another brand of diaper my kid automatically turns red with a rash. I go back to using Seventh Generation and the rash disappears. 

2. These diapers are super absorbent. The polymer used is very absorbent and not as harmful as other diaper brands. My daughter can go all night in these diapers and the diaper is still dry to the touch on the outside which is never the case with other brands. I stand amazed. 

3. The resealable closure tabs and elastic gatherings on the legs fit very well and while the sizes seem to run a bit smaller and shorter than say, Pampers or Huggies, they still work remarkably well and don't fall off. 

4. Seventh Generation diapers break the myth that green products automatically cost more money. I bought four packs of size one diapers (176 diapers) recently and spent less than $50. That is about $25 cheaper than if I had bought the same amount of diapers from another name brand. I could buy the store brand but then I would have leaky diapers, more rashes and tons of laundry to do. Is that really worth saving me a few dollars? No, I think not. 

My only real complaint is that I wish I had tried these diapers out with my first child. It would have saved me a ton of money in diapers and diaper rash creme and I would have had a happier baby.

I've been exercising from the comfort of my own living room for just about a year now, and was feeling like I had plateaued. This workout has solved that problem completely. It's definitely a no-joke workout. Each time I do it, I'm never certain if I'll be able to finish it, but the multiple circuit format helps you recover enough to keep pushing onward. It's challenging, and afterward I feel like a mean lean metabolic machine! This is a tough workout, so start out doing as many circuits as you can and build from there. For any beginners purchasing this workout, I would first suggest buying Jillean's 30 day shred workout as a primer. It worked for me!

I bought this machine because of positive comments on the quality of the bread pan and the crust it produced. I have not been disappointed with crust quality (or bread quality), but so far find that any setting other than "light" produces crust that is unacceptably overdone.

While the yeast dispenser seems like a great idea, especially for delayed start baking, in practice there is a problem with it. Perhaps because of static electric charge in the cold, dry, winter climate in New England, a surprising amount of yeast usually forms a layer that sticks to the dispensing cup and is not added to the dough.

Another complaint is that usually a small amount of dry ingredients is tossed out of the pan during the initial mix cycle, causing both a burning smell and a clean up hassle. This may be a problem only with the smaller loaves (M, or 1-1/2 lb.), which is all I make.

I solve both the above problems by not using the yeast dispenser and inverting the dry/liquid order of adding ingredients, putting the yeast in last on top of the other dry ingredients.  I have not made any delayed start loaves this way yet, so I do not know if it will affect bread quality for delayed starts.

There's not much to say about "Changeling" without blabbing away the  essential plot. I will say that writer J. Michael Straczinski was given some info about a horrible case involving the LA police during the late 1920's. Using this info, he crafted a riveting screenplay to expose a true situation that many aren't aware of. I agree with some previous reviewers who said that the last half-hour wasn't really necessary, creating red herrings that weren't fully resolved.  In the hands of director Clint Eastwood, with an amazing crew that recreated LA in the 1920's to the letter, this isn't that major a flaw. Ms. Jolie is confident and powerful, avoiding a lot of histrionic clich閟 that might've been. It's a great performance. She is the absolute center of this film. There are terrific and complete supporting roles by John Malkovich as a crusading preacher, and Colm Feore as an arrogant police chief. The small but powerful appearance by Amy Adams is amazing, giving Jolie's character the grit to survive. Jeffrey Donovan is excellent as one of the most unlikable characters I've ever seen, a police captain who seems to hold the reins. Also fine is Michael Kelly, as, perhaps, the only good cop in the film. Without giving anything away, watch for a magnificent performance by Jason Butler Harner as a delusional sicko. Yes, it probably didn't have to be so long, but watching the wonderful actors under Mr. Eastwood's guidance is worth it. It's a true story that somewhat went "under the radar", since the Great Depression was rife with corruption and crazy people. The DVD extras are minimal, but interesting. I was never bored for a minute.

When our first child was born we tried every diaper at the store.  We couldn't get a diaper to last him through the night without leaking.  Pampers was the only diaper that would not leak through night.  I prefer the green box to the purple box (cruisers) because the purple box diapers leave some gel looking residue on the baby's skin.  We are now onto our second child and he just turned two.  We still swear by Pampers diapers.  I agree that their wipes aren't as good as Huggies.

Turbo Tax Premier is (for me) an easy to use helpful program that takes the scare out of tax returns. The Premier edition is what I needed to take me through the cashless exercise of stock options. Having seen what happens to people if these forms are not filled out correctly, I don't mind the extra fee for the peace of mind. 

Turbo tax takes you through every deduction and guides you to what you can take and what you can't (and what you can but shouldn't). Turbo tax even sets up your direct deposit for refund (or takes the information from last year if nothing has changed). The only issue I had with the program was at the end when I wanted to file, it left me at 99% until I finally found the continue button was not where all the other continue buttons are (in the middle of the page) but I had to scroll down to the bottom of the last page and then it was done.

I have owned a Kitchenaid mixer and the grinder attachment for about 12 years.  The body of the original grinder cracked, which was the reason I bought a new one.  Overall the design on the parts have changed some,  but the fit and finish of the parts still looks the same.  The plastic wrench for loosening the nut is now combined with the pusher.  My original grinder had a wooden pusher. I think the plastic combination pusher will be more sanitary so that is a good change.  The cutter blade in the new unit is thinner and appears to be a stamped piece instead of the heavier machined investment casting of the old one.  I hope it holds up as long.

Like all new things, cats take a bit to adjust, mine were ready for full use within an our or so after looking, sniffy, and feeling the new device.  I have two, one cat is a faucet loving cat, while the other is very choosey and only wants the freshest of clean water.  We've had the fountain for a few days now and I don't think I've ever seen them drink so much.  I placed the fountain in my bedroom where I used to have my personal water fountain that they used to drink from (the one they weren't supposed to drink from) so they would be comfortable with the spot.  It is far far from food and litter and thus far has remained unbelievably clean.  I've only been using clean water from a purifier to keep the motor lasting longer.  The sound is very minimal and is actually quite soothing, somewhat like a fishing tank moan.  For the price, it was a great addition for my babies.

This the seventh year my girl friends and I have gotten together to make Christmas cookies. We all have Kitchen Aids but this year I upgraded to the Artisan model. The extra horsepower made a real difference when mixing the stiffer dough since we double the batches. The motor on the Artisan model stayed cooler than my previous one.

The Whirley Pop looks like a silly kitchen gadget, but it isn't. It'll make you love popcorn again (or, worse yet, make you hate other popped corn). Crisp, tender, flavorful popcorn is what you'll get everytime from  this wonderful popper. Not only does it make the best popcorn, it is nearly  foolproof and quick. As long as you keep spinning this bad boy you'll never  have burnt corn again.

Remember the days when HBO shows kicked arse?  Whether it was AL SWEARENGEN ruling the roost of THE GEM, or TITUS PULLO skewering some poor plebe, or even BEN HAWKINS touching someone back to life.  Well, we all know those days are sadly gone, but thanks to some gutsy, creative thinking on SHOWTIME's part we have DEXTER MORGAN.  Take either one - season one's ICE TRUCK KILLER, or season two's BAY HARBOR BUTCHER, and you have what is (fact, not opinion) one of the best shows ever aired.  Every TV series you've ever seen has had a quandary about the second season equaling the first.  This one don't.  Both seasons are on par Fan-friggin-tastic.  MICHAEL C HALL (pulling a 180 from his superb character of DAVID FISHER from the superb SIX FEET UNDER) plays the best television character possibly ever.  Hey, the guy likes to chop people (albeit, bad people) up into little pieces, but YOU LOVE HIM, that makes for compelling viewing any day of the week.  Best show on the tube right now, HANDS DOWN.  Can't wait for season 3!

If you have been in the computer world for any amount of time, you begin to realize that you will need to transfer or transport data in the form of pictures, files or programs from your computer to another place.  Whether you are a true computer geek (term of honor earned by experience) or merely a computer user just surfing the web and receiving e-mails. USB flash devices are the easiest way to transport files.  Every modern computer has a USB access port and many of the legacy (older) computers have one as well.  While there are more complex methods of file transfer available for the hard-core user, the USB flash drive allows us to transfer data with the minimum of knowledge or effort.  Many firms accept USB flash drives so for the Mom who just got an e-mail full of pictures of her grand kids, she can download the pictures to a USB flash device and Kinko's (or any other printing firm) can use this device to print.  They are small and easy to use.  Kingston has been in the computer business for a very long time.  True grognards of the computer world will recall Kingston Memory (RAM) as a former leader in the industry.  This particular device works as well as any USB flash device on the market. The cost is inexpensive and technical support (You probably won't ever need it) is available.  Keep in mind, o product is without a downside.  There are three minor issues that all USB flash drives have.  1.)  The data transfer rate (time it takes to move files to and from the drive) can be slow depending on the size of the files.  2.)  The device is easy to misplace.  It is small and can fit on a key chain.  However, if you are a chronic misplacer of items, this little guy can get away from you.  3.) Capacity (amount the device can hold) is important.  Why spend money on smaller drives?  As a general rule of thumb, in the computer world, more is almost always better.  The Kingston USB drive is 4 GB.  That places it in the higher capacity end of USB drives on the market today.  In short, this is a good deal.

This review is from: Wall-E (Three-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)

      



CAUTION: REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS!!


At first glance (as well as the first time I saw previews for this film) I was thinking "Oh boy, not another dumb Disney film with pointless characters and overdone CGI." 

Not so! In fact, this film is the furthest from that. Yes, if you take the film at face-value, sure enough you'll find that the above statement is 100% true. On the other hand, if you take the opportunity and time (not, by the way-wasted) you'll find that this film is layered with comments about our current society and its possible future problems. 

But first, let me give a premise for the film: 

This film is as much about a little robot named Wall-E and his adventure in finding the people who left earth and bringing them back, as well as finding his first crush, Eve. 

Within the film are several product placements: Eve- who represents the Mac and Wall-E who represents the PC in some ways (except for his recharging sound being the sound of a  Mac computer-starting up). The contrast of course is this sleek, shiny, clean, new robot who arrives and Wall-E for the first time realizes, for better or for worse, how desolate his job really is. 

Wall-E, unlike his fellow workers (also called "Wall-E") has outlasted the 700 years of sandstorms and garbage pick-up. With Eve's arrival, Wall-E finally has someone to share his world (and collection of human utensils) with. He shows her a number of items- all commonly used today- but not on the Star-Liner "The Axiom" where all food and beverages are drunk through a cup (gross). 

After Eve presents her finding- (the plant Wall-E originally found for his collection on Earth and showed to Eve) to the Captain and the AUTO-Pilot, a mutiny begins to brew. The AUTO-Pilot is on his own directive to never allow humans to return to earth. Whereas Eve is determined to take the plant to the hollow-detector. Wall-E, not understanding this, causes chaos and confusion among the orderly robots and ship. Eventually it is the chaos of Wall-E and Eve's final acceptance of Wall-E's naivete and at the end- courage to help her fulfill her directive. 

Now, the aesthetic creativity in this film begins with the first 30 minutes of the film being silent except for Wall-E's occasional noises. Otherwise there is no dialogue until their trek to the AXIOM. The film is full of subtleties: for example- when the Probe-Ship leaves the Earth it blasts through an atmosphere of satellites and probes. Yes, our lovely "Blue" earth does look like that. We've been shooting so much junk or trash into space (like the Giant Wall-E bots do on the AXIOM)that our Earth looks like it's been infested with satellitis (satellite disease, not an actual disease- but still). 

Additionally, the U.S. in particular has a huge laziness and technology problem. This is made evident by the fact that the entire AXIOM's activities are virtual and the people interact through computers and screens when their friends or family are right next to them. No one is aware of their ability to walk or that there are such things as a pool. 

Basic terms and foods become obsolete in the future because robots have replaced our need to do things ourselves. Wall-E's chasing of Eve (and as a result the uniting of two people: Mary and John- who experience real emotions for the first time- and interaction face to face without a console in between). 

Also, the film has amazing sounds, an incredible score, and the closing song "Down to Earth" by Peter Gabriel tops the charts! The DVD includes commentary on the film as well as on the sounds made in the film. Find out how the makers created Eve's laser or the ship's sound as it takes off from Earth! (It's really amazing- some are even so simple it's funny).

I could name all the references in the film (I've bought this very DVD)and watched it many times. I can see no reason why it can't be viewed on the same par as the Best Picture Nominations. 

In fact, I think it is the best film of the year and deserves to win all six of its nominations as well as Best Picture.

So, maybe you've seen it once and went "Well, there's no talking..." I'd say "SHUT UP AND WATCH THE FILM!" Because it is a piece of artwork and not another Hollywood entertainer with overdone CGI and doesn't require you to think. 

Think you must, Talk you mustn't. - Is what Yoda would have said if he saw this film.

I agree with an earlier reviewer: 'If it lasts, it will be near-perfect'.
Mine lasted about 6 years (using it about 20 times/year) to make orange juice for weekend breakfasts when oranges are in season.  Now the gearing is worn out and I am looking  to buy a replacement.
Functionality:..... 5 stars (makes OJ with ease)
Ease of Cleaning: 5 stars (just rinse while pulb is still wet in the strainer)
Longevity:......... 2 stars (while I got my money's worth - this juicer is cheap -, I hate having to throw an entire appliance away when only a part is broken; I prefer longevity over cheap initial cost.  B&D, charge more money and make it last longer!).

I bought this cat water bowl not expecting a huge change in my two cats' drinking habits. But, after an initial stage of ignoring the bowl, both cats now use it, and drink very enthusiastically. One of my cats is 15. I know it's important to keep older cats drinking water frequently, so this purchase has been quite sucessful.

I love this epilator! As with any epilator there is discomfort the first time or two using it. If you have used the old style coil epilators you will like the tweezer style much better. It pulls the hair not the skin.
Specific to this product:
It's easy to use.  The attachments are easy to change.  The shaver/trimmer attachment is a nice addition for those places you would rather not epilate.  The little "headlight" on it sounds silly, but is a great help. I'm not a fan of the "massaging" attachment, but all in all I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an epilator.

I thought HSM 3 was an awesome movie. The acting and songs were amazing. I am just sad to see an excellent triology come to an end.

In high school musical 3 you get to see all of the emotions and changes that happen during senior year. You get to see Troy and Gabriella's relationship progress, you get to see what everyone's future is going to be, you get to see prom (Troy and Gabriella look amazing and so does the rest of the class), you get to see everyone graduate, and you get to see everyone say goodbye to each other which was really sad. There are some really hard decisions to be made in this movie and I think everyone did an excellent job acting it out.

Overall this movie was great. It was played out really well. When you are watching this movie you really feel like you are also saying goodbye to the cast and its really sad.

I wish the entire cast good luck with everything they do in the future.

If you love the first two high school musical films then I know you'll love this one as well.

The Extended version of the film comes with an extended version of the film, sing alongs, cast interviews, bloopers and so much more. I highly recommend you pick up the extended version of the film instead of the theatrical version. It is well worth the extra money.

I have a larger HP laptop that I use to work from home. Because its large (so that the kids can watch movies when we travel) and its hooked up to all my peripherals (keyboard, printer, back up, etc), its been a hassle to unplug when I want to work at the java joint. Further,  I have wanted to do some fiction writing, but don't want to sit at my work computer to do it. So I bought the ASUS as I thought it would meet my needs for a portable, affordable way to write somewhere other than my home office.

I retrospect, I probably should have bought the 4g one for the additional space. But it didn't come in green. I have a writing program that needs windows to run so by the time I loaded XP and the program, there was little room for anything else (windows likes to have 200 mb free space). 

However, I do love it. It jumps online with no problems. The Linux setup with OpenOffice and other sources already on it worked great and I would have kept it if I could have run my writing program. It has 3 usb ports so I'm able to plug in a mouse and flash drive. It has a slot for a SD card as well. I bought the 4g SD card to go with it. Using the card or a flash drive I can move between the ASUS and my regular laptop easily.

The keyboard is small but that's what you get for wanting a small laptop. The only trouble I've had with it is that sometimes I hit the arrow up key instead of the shift key. 

The ASUS offers a great little system for an affordable price. I wouldn't expect to run a business on it or have too many applications. But if you're looking for something portable that you can use to access the Internet or write documents, its a nice little system.

A wonderfully told tale of romance, pirates, political intrigue, and &quot;true love&quot; overcoming all.  Fun characters, good for any age from 3 to 103.

i am now 18 and i loved this movie. i saw it two times in the theaters and am going to get it once it comes out on dvd cheaper. i liked this move partly because i am in high school and i love musicals. i only really realized that it was actually going along with my years in high school. i some times think about  how this movie may give the younger kids a bad impression on how high school life actually is. in real life you don't always get every thing you want. they actually show some of this in in the movie but most high school don't look that nice ether. but i still love this movie no mater what. i may would just tell my kid to not expect that much fun or inter group interaction. this is a good movie for some one who likes musicals or romantic movies my mom cant stand this movie because she does not like musicals. well that's an 18 year old look at this movie i would advise to rent first if you are not to sure. WARNING you watch this 1 time and you cant stop

These headphones are a good buy.  However, at first, the mic wasn't working.  Saitek said it might be faulty, so I got a replacement through Amazon (within a couple of days).  The second mic didn't work either, until I started changing the codecs in the "Multi Media Properties".  The mic wouldn't work with the C-Media codec (the one that came with the headphones).  The Sound Recording section had to be set to Soundmax (my original).  

Other than the codec needing changed, (now they work beautifully), a very good product.  They're a huge difference from normal stereo headphones.

Highly recommended.

My only complaint is the lights on the front are in reverse order from the cables at the back, but they are all numbered correctly anyway. Instead of a crossover switch for the uplink there is an extra port, so don't try to use all six plugs at once! ;)A pleasant surprise for me was this *switch* cost me half of what I paid a couple years ago for a (now-dead) 5-port dual-speed *hub* (by another brand).

I was not exactly skeptical or anything when I decided to get this, but I did not think it would be anywhere near this beautiful. It has the obvious flaws of smearing and having slightly slow speeds. That barely matters. This thing is so small, noiseless, barely heats up, and so far has not had any problems for me. Having to format it was no big deal either, but I can see how some people who are ignorant might have a problem with it!

I was so shocked to see the reviews that people have written! What is wrong with you guys! THIS IS A FANTASY SERIES!!! Stephanie Meyer has the right to write whatever she wants.  It doesn't have to make sense logically. She wanted the series to end happily ever after. It most certainly did too! Everything works out and Bella and Edward couldn't be more happy.  They got to have their cake and eat it too! It's refreshing to have a happy ending when our world is so depressing. This book was great and exciting!! I was surprised when Bella got pregnant but I was happy to find out that things went perfectly. As for the thing with Jacob, Stephanie obviously wanted to keep him close by. It wouldn't have been fun to see the pain Bella or Jacob might of felt but...again...it All WORKED OUT! I thought it was a great closing to a great series!

Overall great coffee maker.  Needed to find a replacement for my 10 year old Mr. Coffee, and chose to go with the Cuisinart DCC-1200.

-Nice design, the matte black finish disguises smudges and water spots.

-  Great cup-of-joe, everytime.  Then again i've had the same results from a $9 Proctor Silex at the office.  Not to mention i use premium Kona coffee from Hawaii.

-  Auto features are easy to use and program.

-  I concur with a previous review, in that the water resevoir has a small opening and is oddly placed.  Pour carefully.

-  It comes with a water filter....cool.

-  Fork down an additional $10 for the replacement Gold Filter Basket (#4), it's worth it's weight in gold....pun intended.

-  My parents have been happy using the same machine over the past year.

Okay, maybe not that long. But it did take me a good hour and a half to two hours to set this thing up. However, after setting up, it hasn't stopped working on me yet (over the past 4 days) which is a plus, because the router I bought before this (Linksys G w/ speedbooster) sucked, and would stop working every 5 minutes. So, all in all, I like this router. Can't really comment on any speed enhancements or anything, however.

(E) As far as speed, I'm usually working on 2 bars, which gives me about the same speed as my old ethernet connection. When I move around/have more bars, the speed is pretty blazing fast actually.

We've been using the FURminator for a few days now. We've removed a cat's worth of hair from our cat, CiCi. And she still has tons of hair. She doesn't really care all that much to be brushed and we seem to grab the brush and her just about every day. Well, my husband does, anyway. I really don't brush her all that much myself. I get to vaccuum up all the hair on everything...

Anyway, our cat is a long-haired super shedder. That's a domestic type cat of some kind. She will tolerate the FURminator about the same as the wire brush--she'd run if she could, but if you get a good hold of her, she's yours while you attempt to remove hair. The FURminator removes a load of hair compared to the wire brush. It takes little effort, other than holding the cat down. So, for less effort we are removing more hair. She's not bald--not even close. I imagine if we keep this up for a couple more weeks we'll be able to taper down to every other day. 

The amound of hair we're taking off CiCi is amazing! Piles of it! It's kind of sickly fascinating! SO, what can we do with this hair? I guess we could put it out for the birds to line nests with? I don't really want to learn to make cathair yarn, altho I do know how to knit. 

Wish I had bought this years ago. I would probably have saved money on lint rollers....

It's easy to be seduced by the iPod Touch. From the giant screen to the cool menu approach to the intuitive interface and wireless networking, it's not just a media player; it's a personal entertainment device with seemingly few limits. For anyone who wants to carry a sizeable music and/or video library, however, the Touch has its shortcomings, and it is here that the iPod Classic shines.

If you're the target audience for this device, you're likely going to carry a mixture of music, photos, and video around with you, and the Classic is designed to meet the needs of those who will do so. Sure, the screen is smaller than the Touch, and it's not going to make your friends, classmates, or co-workers stop and stare, but if you're looking for a high-capacity player that is backed by Apple's iTunes (still the best media library program for my money) and works exceedingly well, it's hard to do better than the Classic.

Wireless updating, greater game variety, quicker Cover Flow loading (it and the dropdown menus within are fun and slick-looking, but laggy and not entirely useful), and an FM tuner would be nice, but these are small drawbacks compared to the overall utility of a media player as roomy as the Classic. Album images also can take a few seconds to load when starting a new shuffle or playlist, but otherwise the iPod gets everything in order seamlessly. I also noticed that at times song time counter would skip a second, which seemed to happen closer to the end of a track; I don't know if it's related to preloading the next track information or not. There seems to be a general lag the unit experiences that isn't entirely noticeable and is somewhat forgiveable since it's running off of a hard drive and not solid-state memory, but it can detract from the experience at times when the unit pauses to load an album cover or move on to the selected section.

This surprisingly slim device (which fits easily into the "fifth pocket" in jeans and isn't much bigger than a Razr-family cell phone) replaced my comparatively bulky 4G iPod, and I couldn't be more pleased with the bright screen, improved sound quality, and overall variety of function. I've gone from having a music player to having a handheld entertainment device capable of carrying thousands and thousands of songs alongside a small library of films and thousands of photos as well. Until we get a cost-effective flash player that holds more than 32GB, this is the device for power-users.

Of minor note is that the "black" model is more of a galaxy shade, as opposed to a pure black.

This is a great product that does exactly what it was supposed to do- work by reading and writing data with no problems experienced whatsoever. It is also quite fast compared to other similar drives that I have used. The 8 Gb Kingston DT-110 is definitely a great quality product even though it is very light, but at the same time it appears to be extremely rugged with a very nice and reliable retracting USB junction switch. The switch is either pushed open to use in a USB port or pushed closed in the opposite direction to retract making the "user" end of the unit completely safe from breakage when not in use. Thus, there is never any cap to loose either. Hopefully they will soon make this model in a 16 or 32 Gb version too!

UPDATE: October 3, 2008: I have recently tried USB flash memory drives from Adata (8 Gb, with a standard connector), this model the Kingston DT-110 (8 Gb Green retractable version), the Corsair Survivor (16 Gb metal encased unit with 256 bit encryption capability) and the OCZ ATV 32 Gb rubber-encased drive. Of all these I definitely prefer the OCZ for its huge size and reliability as well as its durability and small physical size to boot. Next, however, I liked the Kingston DT-110 retractable unit. If the DT-110 was currently produced with a larger capacity I probably would have purchased that one first since the connector is totally protected when not in use. I didn't like the Corsair at all and it was way too large in my opinion, but well protected. The Adata unit died after 7 months of relatively light usage.
   I have had this storage device in routine use now for over 6 months and its performance has been as expected earlier-exemplary! I highly recommend it for its relatively small amount of storage capacity, namely 8 GB- Now who would have said that in a sentence 5 or more years ago at least at today's prices which continue to fall almost weekly!

The automatic feeder works pretty well.  The programming is indeed counter-intuitive, as many reviewers have previously noted, but not impossible.  Our cats did figure out how to stick their paws up the chute to release one piece of dry food at a time.  This satisfied their boredom more than their hunger, I would imagine.  It's actually pretty amusing.  However, our cats are particularly neurotic around food, and one cat tended to bully the other out of the way.  Ironically, the cat that meows incessantly for food (hence buying this and the Feliway plug-in to try to alleviate some of his stress) was the meeker one, so I'd say the automatic feeder would probably work best for single cat households.  Or those lucky households with cats that all get along.

Finally, a product that works and helps alleviate wasted trips to the vet! Don't understand why vets refuse to prescribe ear medicine w/ more frequent refills, knowing some breeds are so infection susceptible, so Zymox is a wonderful find!!! Worked almost overnight- scratching and smell gone within 24 hours! Great find!!!!

When I started using the Sonicare I didn't believe it was gonna do anything.  I got it as a present.  Then after using it twice a day for several months, I began to receive a lot of compliments on my teeth.  For the first time in my life I had a glowing report from my dentist and my gums didn't bleed when he did the flossing.

So even though you may be skeptical about it's ability to help your teeth.  Try it and you won't dread your visits to the dentist.

My shaving routine has me using a foil shaver and then following that up with a Gillette Mach3. The P-70 is one of the best foil shavers I've ever used and overall one of the best designed products I've ever seen. It's completely self contained, waterproof, has a built in trimmer that retracts and even has a small attached brush for cleaning the foil blades. Plus the cover is built-in. I read the previous reviews, bought one and agree 100% with all of the great things said about this shaver. I'm thinking about buying an extra for a spare. If you find something you really like, I find it's best to buy a spare. No telling how long they'll be around. 

Highly recommended!

I used this on my 3-lb pomeranian after he was 8 weeks old.  He vomited that night but I didn't think anything of it.  A month later, the night after another treatment, he vomited again.  I asked my vet who said that a small minority of dogs may have a reaction to the permethrin.  My dog's reaction was fairly mild, but she recommended that I go back to Frontline.

I went back to Frontline, no problem.  

When I ran out, I decided to try the Advantix again.  My dog was about 1 year old and about 4.5 lbs.  No problem whatsoever.   

I did some research afterwards and read on the internet somewhere that Advantix is not recommended for dogs under 3 lbs.  But I can't seem to find that anywhere now. 

Anyway, I'm sure Advantix is fine for most dogs.  It seems to be fine for my dog now, but I'm still wary and think I'll prefer to use Frontline.

We have a Bichon Frise as a member of our family.  I have tried numerous products without success (predominantly topical).  When I saw the manufacturer's website, I saw hope for my brown tear stained dog's face.

I ordered the product and it came in a well insulated package.  This product is a powdered form of dried liver.  It smells ok and when my dog sniffed it, he ate it right away.  It is too thick like chocolate milk to put it into water.

After a week, I wondered if it would ever work.  After two weeks there was a 50% reduction.  By week 3, I was reassured that the product was working well.  By week 4, the tear stains were practically resolved.  Beard and tear stains resolved after about a month of use.

I was told it works secondary to a low level antibiotic.

This product works better than ANYTHING in the market.

This product works and the money was worth every penny.  I highly recommend this product.

Amazing netbook. I got it quickly. It looks nice, feels like it's good quality, and runs extremely well. The battery life shocks and amazes me on it. The keyboard is very nice to type on, the few keys that got moved or shortened make sense, and feel good to use in their modified state. The wireless conectivity is excellent as well.
Nothing negative to say about this. It's small, light, quiet, has lots of go power.
I would recommend an upgrade of the bag, as the fabric one that comes with the netbook isn't too secure.

With all these reviews on one book what can I add? My two cents worth. Didn't know anything about this book until I ran across a blog that talked about the reactions it was getting. A little truth in advertising about me: I'm 53 years old, married 30 years and have been a Christian since 1978. My church background was mainly Pentecostal-charismatic. But thank God, the fact that I was a reader of books outside the church library with its paltry offerings of Kenneth Copeland and the rest of the clones saved my mind from severe shrinkage. If it hadn't been for that I'd probably be condemning William Young with the rest of the Christian mob who could easily be the crowd who came with clubs and pitchforks to kill Frankenstein.

	My personal theology is pretty conservative and, in the past, I've been part of conservative causes. But I will not be confined by a label, and the tired semantic bookends of "liberal" and "conservative" leave far too much undefined to be useful anymore. My question to anyone, whichever label they like to use, is do you use your God given brain to do any serious thinking worthy of the name? Generally speaking liberal types are propelled by emotion while conservative types are propelled by tradition. They both make me sick. Emotion has its place as well as tradition but neither should do the driving.

	So I ordered Young's book from Amazon and read it in a week. There were points here and there where I thought the book was weak and, being a longtime reader of theology, I found myself wondering at times if some concept was going too far here and there. Despite that, I am thrilled that somebody had the guts to write this book. The average Christian is singularly UNIMAGINATIVE and, when it comes to being faithful to Christ, they don't seem to know how to do that with much alacrity and variety. There is some unspoken rule that you can't follow God sincerely without operating within some very rigid guidelines and looking rigid while you do it. 

	Sure, one can go to the other extreme and have no regard for guidelines while substituting personal preference. But I don't see either extreme as unavoidable. When I read the Bible I don't see either extreme unless Jesus or Paul or a prophet is warning against it. Everywhere else I see a whole lot of freedom that never loses sight of God. I give The Shack five stars, not for impeccable theology or first rate writing (though it wasn't bad), but for daring to bring a sanctified use of IMAGINATION to us all. There hasn't been anyone to do that well since C.S. Lewis.
	
	It's easy to be one of the sourpuss pitchfork carriers always on the lookout for heretical departures while sounding like John Hagee (one of whom is more than enough). God' knows, the only fiction the Christian world is known for now is that load of crap called the Left Behind series. I believe the series is well named. Left brain people are generally more logical. When you think of the depth and majesty of Christ and what He's bequeathed us and the best Christians can come up with is the Left Behind series, it proves they are doing their thinking with the left behind.

	My hope is that The Shack will start the ball rolling and encourage other Christian writers to unshackle their imaginations and give us some exciting and powerful alternatives to the bland fare of Family Christian Bookstores everywhere

While I can't say that my teeth are any cleaner or look better, it sure feels great to use this waterpik.  I bought it for my wife, who has a bridge that gives her problems and her dentist recommended getting one.  When I saw that it came with attachments for more than one person, I decided to try it. I LOVE IT!  My mouth feels fresh after using and feels clean like I just went to the dentist for a cleaning.  I use it on a 7 setting, my wife likes 4.  The only thing I don't like is that the head can pop off too easily if your thumb hits the button, shooting water all over.  Sometimes it comes out of my mouth when cleaning my front gums, again shooting water all over.

I can't imagine a better one-quart yogurt maker. I just bought mine 3 weeks ago - and have made 3 batches. Perfect every time. 

I am lactose intolerant - and so when I discovered a way to make home made yogurt that was lactose free, I had to try. Let me explain where I learned about this: There is a group that puts out a diet for those with stomach and intestinal problems - they have a healthy diet regimine called the SCD (or specific carbohydrate diet). Those folks can't tolerate lactose (I can't either) and so store-bought yogurt isn't tolerated by their (or my) bodies. The store-bought yogurt isn't fermented long enough to remove all of the lactose. If you ferment your milk with cultures for 24 hours however, you have lactose free yogurt. :) And it's very tasty. 

Here's how I do it: I wash and dry all the utensils and yogurt container and lid in hot soapy water. Everything must be very clean - because you want your yogurt cultures to grow - but you do not want stray bacteria to grow. I measure 1 quart (4 cups) of whole cow milk - pour it into a sauce-pan. I clip a cheap candy thermometer to the side of the pan (hang it inside the milk - but don't let the thermometer tip quite touch the pan bottom) Bring cows milk to a boil. If the milk boils slightly you will have a slightly firmer yogurt product. (Note: goat milk shouldn't be boiled - but only brought up to 180 or 185 degrees instead). AFter reaching boiling point - I remove the pan from the stove and place the entire pan in a larger pan containing an inch or two of cold water. This cold water bath helps your milk cool faster (If I'm in a real hurry, I change the cold water several times as it warms up). Stir continuously as is it cools - and watch your thermometer reading drop. When the temperature drops to 112 - 108 degrees, I ladel out a small amount of milk in a small cup and stir in 1 packet of Yogourmet yogurt starter. (hotter temps will kill the starter). Carefully stir the starter into this small amount of milk - do not whisk it hard. When  it looks well melted, then blend this all into your pan of milk. Blend everything carefully and thoroughly. For all of my stirring - I use the tiny ladel / spoon provided with the yogurt maker - it is small but works just fine and it harbours no bacteria since it is all one piece.  Pour the pan of cultured milk into your 1-quart yogurt container and place that container into the yogurt maker. Plug in the maker - it's like a little crock pot - and leave it alone for 24 hours. Then remove quart container and refrigerate yogurt for 8 more hours. After that - enjoy! It's a little tart - but it is no more tart than sour cream - and is very easy to sweeten up with jams, jellies, fresh fruit, maple syrup, sugar etc. Very yummy - very nutritious and super easy! Great for those of us who love yogurt but can't tolerate the store-bought stuff due to lactose intolerance or other illness. Enjoy!!

I have purchased this gamepad back in early 2005, and noticed that this is one fine controller, with the PS2-style layout.  This makes the controller very easy to program, as well.  Most of the buttons are numbered so you can program a game around those numbers on the button.  Also, the comfort level is everything I wanted, not like those old controllers that hurt your hands after two hours of gameplay.  The only drawback is that this doesn't have a vibration/rumble motor for those impact moments like my XBox controller does, or even a PS2 controller.  Needless to say, the controls are very much identical to that of a console gamepad.

I like this rice cooker. It cooks well. I bought this Panasonic cooker mainly for its reliability; I used many rice cookers so far (other brands), they go out of service pretty fast (within 1 to 2 years). I can cook not more that 2 1/4 uncooked rice maximum. I use Indian Basmathi rice to cook. You probably can cook more than that with other types of  rice.

+ Glossy LED display isn't as bad as I was worried about. Works just fine indoors. LED lighting easily overpowers any reflections you may have indoors (unless you're shining a flash light right on the screen). I haven't tried it outside, but I doubt it'll work at all. Then again, why am I trying to use my laptop outside? I usually like working at a desk! Or at least inside. Outside is for playing!

+ OSX Battery life right on target (5 hrs)

+ Form factor and size are really nice for the performance you get in this machine.
  + Plays Command Conquer Red Alert 3 (under Windows) at 1280 by 800 with medium detail like it's nothing.
  + Very nimble with multiple applications open

+ Installs XP Pro and Vista just fine. Bootcamp drivers and support already on the OSX DVD, so you don't need to burn anything. Just pop in the disc after Windows is done installing.

- Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter tricky to set up at first:
  - OSX doesn't let you configure your MacBook to output to external only. You have to wake up or boot the computer while closed (power on, close display quickly!) with the external monitor plugged in for external display only while the laptop is open. If you unplug the Mini DisplayPort cable and plug it back in while in OSX, your laptop screen will turn on and stay on. Annoying.

  - Windows does well with external displays thanks to the NVIDIA software that lets you set which display(s) you want to use, but the first few times, the drivers didn't seem to pick up the external display. Just unplug and plug back in. Eventually Windows XP Pro and Vista seem to "learn" your monitor preference with the external display plugged in. As an engineer, I have a hard time attributing "learning" to an OS, but that's what I observed. Vista seemed to learn faster than XP.

  - Windows sometimes does not recognize the monitor after turning the monitor off for power saving. Again unplugging and replugging the mini displayport fixes this. Annoying.

~ For what it's worth I use an Envision 20" g2016wa2 monitor with the Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter. I had some problems getting the monitor to recognize the VGA signal reliably when running Windows, but after a software update in OSX that problem seemed to go away. May or may not have been related.

- Screw holding hard drive clip in was easy to strip. Took a lot of pressure to start unscrewing, so be careful when you want to upgrade your hard drive.

- Slot loading drive doesn't always behave: sometimes it won't swallow the disc, or eject it all the way out, or feel like it's still holding on to the disc after ejecting and you want to take the disc out. No worries though because you just have to push the disc back in, hit eject. If that doesn't work, you might need to power down so the drive resets. Annoying.

- Battery life in Windows XP is worse than in OSX, probably because the power management drivers aren't as good. I noticed only 1:15 remaining after copying 5-10gigs of data with Wifi on and backlight about 20%. I may not have had a full charge though.

- Stand-by not reliable in Windows, so make sure it actually goes to sleep before you bag the computer. I found out the hard way and pulled out a very warm metal laptop--cooled off quickly thankfully and continued running fine.

- Touch pad in Windows is lousy: I use my right thumb to click touchpad buttons (in this case virtual button) while still touching the pad with my index finger, so when I do that in Windows, the cursor moves a little bit. You can use the tip of your index finger to do the click. Get an external mouse.

NB: My Windows complaints are certainly minor issues for some people since this is a Mac, but some of us do like to be able to play PC games :)

So overall, the problems I found certainly aren't show stoppers. It's a nice laptop given the performance, price, form factor, and capabilities.

I hope you found my quick points helpful.

P.S. Keep in mind I purchased the 2.0GHz model, which is plenty fast. In my experience the performance increase for the core processors isn't that huge when just increasing the frequency. It's the cache that'll speed up some things, but it's not worth the expense when Corei7 is coming out next year!

I love this thing! It does it all. Chops meat, makes pesto and purees soup in a flash.

I love mine and use it a lot. They need to update the "how-to" video VHS to a DVD, though. I have no complaints. It sits on my counter waiting my beck and call. It is a great help for those who cook lots and lots. Quality and a bargain price--who could argue with that?

This review is from: Gone with the Wind (VHS Tape)

      



Recently I looked up in Amazon.com the customer reviews for Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;. There were 308. Next I looked up the customer reviews for Antoine Fran鏾is Pr関ost's 1732 novel &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;. There were 2. Here's the point: 200 years ago the Abb?Pr関osts's book was as tremendously popular, as universally famaliar as Miss Mitchell's novel has been in the second half of the 20th Century. I suspect that, as &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; is today primarily known through the operatic versions of Massenet and Puccini, by the end of the 21st Century &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; may well be known to the masses primarily through the cinematic version of David O Selznick. That's why it's important that the film be evaluated on its own terms. Is &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; a great film? Well, it is permanently absorbing and entertaining (in the elevated sense) like any true work of art, be it the Iliad or Beethoven's Ninth. The story of a spoiled Southern belle living through the horrors of Civil War and the shame of Occupation is still sharply relevant. Read today's news stories. Released at the beginning of World War II in 1939, the annus mirabilis of Hollywood, &quot;GWTW&quot; is certainly the opus mirabilis of that year of wonders. Large, colorful, richly romantic,it is the apogee of Hollywood professionalism. It does not really do much for the auteur theory: at least three directors worked on it. Victor Fleming gets screen credit, though there are cin閍sts who think the movie would have been greater had it been completed by its original director George Cukor. But I think this is first and foremost a producer's picture. Every aspect, from the graceful winding of the Twelve Oaks staircase to the famous crane shot of the tragic train depot, says &quot;Selznick&quot;. Even Max Steiner's iconic score seems to have been controlled by the producer. The cast, of course, is legendary. Vivien Leigh was the perfect actress to play Scarlett O'Hara. A shrewd woman who realizes she is living in a man's world, Scarlett can be a purring kitten one minute and a snarling tiger the next. Miss Leigh handles both sides with conviction. In Rhett Butler, Clark Gable found the role that might have been written for him. Actually, I've always suspected Miss Mitchell had Gable in mind when she created Captain Butler. The tempestuous relationship between Scarlett and Rhett provides the screen with a sensually cynical dissonance. The scene where Rhett finally proposes to Scarlett -- she's drunk, he's sardonic, wearing a sprig from her late husband's funeral wreath -- is fairly shocking, much more so than the marital abduction up the Atlanta mansion's staircase and Scarlett's morning-after humming. (There is evidently a theory about the leitmotif of staircases in Sidney Howard's screenplay.) Olivia deHavilland is courageously bland as Melanie Hamilton. Her carriage meeting with Belle Watling (the wonderfully garish Ona Munson) is one of the movie's most poignant scenes. The only flaw in the casting is Leslie Howard, much too old to portray Ashley Wilkes. With all the hoopla over finding the right woman to play Scarlett, Selznick couldn't find an appropriate young actor to fill such an important role? The oddest casting is Eddie Anderson as the white-haired, doddering Uncle Peter. In fact, Eddie Anderson was several years younger than Gable. Moving serenely through the whole story is Hattie McDaniel as the bossy but benign Mammy. It is a great tribute to the Academy that she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Vivien Leigh's Scarlett won Best Actress, and the production itself won Best Picture. This is not a kids' picture. This is not a &quot;date movie&quot;. This is an adult adventure about conflict on several levels, and as such ... yes, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; is a great film.

This Sonicare works great. Teeth feel cleaner than they ever felt using a regular toothbrush. My wife and I both use the same base and switch brushes easily with a couple turns of the brush on or off. Has a built in timer to let you know when to switch from one area of mouth to another. Turns itself off at the end of the cycle. This unit comes with two brushes. Not sure what the higher priced Sonicare units offer that would be worth the extra expense.

I own a copperhead, and I believe this mouse is actually more natural for me than the Copperhead. Being a amphidestrious mouse, there are two buttons that will be harder to reach. For righty, it's the ride side buttons. However, this is not an issue for me and I don't think it will be fore most folks. I do love the dpi changing buttons located below the mouse wheel. On the Copperhead, I had to adjust dpi using the right side buttons, which is also very hard to reach.

The overall quality is better than Copperhead. I love the one piece design and the rubberized surface.

Unlike most reviewers, I don't have any driver issues even before updating the firmware. This is a mouse I can live with even if I don't play game.

The coffee maker made a huge difference in the taste of my coffee, and this grinder bumped it up another notch!  It works smoothly, is much quieter than my blade grinder and makes very little mess. I use it at least twice a day.

During the winter months when the air was dry, there seemed to be static electricity in the grounds and they would fly out of the container when I first opened it after each grind and would stick to whatever was handy. I solved this by draping a damp paper towel over the container before I opened it so the grounds would hit the paper towel and be contained. Now that the weather is warmer and moister there is no more static.

I recommend this grinder to anyone who wants to upgrade from a blade grinder, and I will certainly buy another when and if this one gives out.

P.S. DO remember to follow the unpacking instructions carefully. Unpacking the little grounds container is counter-intuitive, and I can see how some people broke the container.

This blood pressure monitor proved to be a very efficient and cool equipment without any problems. Especially the ComFit Cuff that comes along with the Monitor is the best feature of the new Omron HEM-780 model. I bought this monitor a month ago and has been working absolutely perfect since then. In simple words, I would say, it's worth the price. I strongly recommend it for all those who wish to check their blood pressure at the comfort of sitting at home and not paying a visit to the doctor. Kudos!

I understand the bad reviews, but I feel they're mostly undeserved.

"SPOILERS, DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS"

The book was exellent, and Bella and Edward had a great ending together.  Of course, no one liked Bella having a child so early in life, but it was the only chance she was going to get, people.

Also, Reneesmee's name killed the book for a lot of people, but SM chose it for a reason, because of its uniqueness.

That doesn't mean I wish that they would have simply named her after Edward's mother Elizabeth though.

That was the only thing I didn't like about the book, besides the whole 'nomands and other vampires going off and eating harmless humans while living with the Cullens thing', and the 'Jacob imprinting on his former lovee's INFANT thing'.

I'm glad we found out about Alec.  But I wish we could have found out about Embry, and that Bella's relationship with her father had been drawn out more.

This little waffle iron is easy to use and turns out evenly browned waffles. I followed the manufacturer's directions and sprayed the grids with cooking oil the first time out. I've made a couple of different recipes, and liked the waffles I made from scratch much better than using a mix.

I like it a lot. It really has a lot of power, is very durable and works great. Just make sure you realize that you are only going to be able to make enough for 4 or 5 decent size servings per batch. Then you have to wait until the bowl freezes again to make more. I would recommend buying an extra bowl if you have a large family. Overall, I am pleased with this item.

This netbook is great. It took the place a desktop replacement laptop in the home and has been ideal for checking email and surfing the web. We have been able to install several program too; half expecting the performance to be lackluster, but it has been fine. Any delays in performance I feel can be blamed on the slow HD; but we enjoy the space and valued that over the stability of the SSD.  We are not using it for graphic intensive programs like WoW or Second Life. The battery will run pretty much all day. That would be my biggest recommendation; get the biggest battery you can. This one will run five hours or so. The convenience of it really trumps everything else. It can go anywhere!

If you love Battlestar Galactica but live in a country like New Zealand that has only ever aired the mini-series and season 1 then you rush out to buy the dvd's as soon as they become available.  I personally would like to see more deleted scenes in the box sets but overall a very enjoyable collection.  The series does go a little darker from season 2.5 onwards but this coupled with the character development is what draws me as a woman into the series.  Even if you are not a sci fi fan but enjoy a good drama then do watch this awesome show.

I have two dogs, a mini dachshund and a dachshund/Jack Russell mix. So, as you might imagine.... there is plenty of barking in my house! I don't mind the "alert" type barks, every now and then, but these two tend to get into bark frenzies, only encouraging each other to get louder and louder. Since I am just about to move into an apartment (after living with them in houses), I thought I needed to get a handle on this barking before my neighbors starting complaining. 

First, the unit itself - It's a little smaller than I expected it to be, actually ... maybe about 1"x1"x1". I found it very easy to fill up with the citronella, and didn't experience any of the hardware or technical difficulties that I've read about in reviews. I was worried it wouldn't fit onto my mini, since he's only about 12lbs, but although it did look a little awkward on him, it fit him fairly well. I have yet to replace the batteries, etc. 

Secondly, the performance - I put it on the mini first, and waiting for him to start his racket. The first time he barked and got sprayed, he ran under the couch, barked again since he was scared, got sprayed again, and then ran off and hid in his crate. Not a single peep out of him after that.  The first night he gave me a heartbreaking look of "I know you did this to me", but after the first few days, he's perfectly fine wearing the collar, and doesn't run away when I put it on him (I take it off for him to sleep, since it is a little bulky for such a little dog). 

And finally, a few other notes: 
1) If you have two dogs, get two collars! I originally just bought one, to test it out. However if one dog is wearing the collar, and the other dog barks, it will set the spray off, and this undermines the effectiveness of the collar ... now the dog isn't associating his barking with being sprayed. 
2) I can personally vouch that it isn't painful or uncomfortable - because I got sprayed in the face myself! While holding my dog to my face, I said something and we both got it. It is startling, but not irritating or painful in the least. 
3) I'm sure this depends on the dogs, but mine have already figured out (after only a week) that they won't get sprayed if they aren't wearing the collar. But they don't know whether the collar is turned off or on, and seem to think it's not worth the risk if the collar is on. So if they start barking, I put the collar on them with the switch to on. After maybe an hour I turn the switch off to conserve the battery, and they're still quiet as long as the collar is on. I read that someone else created "dummy" collars for their dog, and I think that might be worth investigating.

The petmate is just great.  I do recommend it.
Programming the feeding sizes and times to feed may not be the easiest and most intuitive thing but if you have '5 and use the manual as a guide you will be OK.
I travel regularly and the petmate saved my friends the time to come home and feed the cat while I'm out.  
Some people had concerns on the servings.  I measured the 1st 5 servings and they were very close to the 1/4 cup.  In my case, this is more accurate than what I used to do in the past which was to give one "hand full" of food.  A hand full could have been any where between 1/5 cup or 1/3 of a cup.
I did not rate the product 5 stars only because I would have liked the option of plugging the petmate to the wall to insure it never runs out of battery.

Kudos to Bill Maher for his enlightening work. If nothing else, this documentary should get an Oscar for editing.  The cut-aways and Bill's conversational punchlines provide many uproarious laughs.  You'll enjoy this DVD many times over.

I did some research and probably 60-70% of US adults do NOT attend a regular weekly religious service.  We are the majority.  We are just as, if not moral, than the religious minorities who have fanned the flames of guilt and fear for centuries.

Save your time and money on Sundays.  Forget the tithing and putting any cash in when they pass the baskets.

Go out and buy as many copies of RELIGULOUS as you can afford...go forth and multiply...the world has been waiting for the visions and wisdom of Bill Maher.

May the universal forces bless Bill Maher, George Carlin...and Joe Pesci!!

Show on every religious holiday.  Praise the wisdom of our founding fathers re: religion...Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Adams, Washington, etc...they all saw the dangers of mixing religion in our politics.  

Wake up, America ... wake up, world!! Revel in your mortality and doubt.  Enjoy life and all living creatures.  You can live a good and fulfilling life without mythology.  There are a lot of good lessons and wisdom in Aesop's Fables.  But you don't have to drink the kool-aid.  Isn't that right, Rev. Jimmy Jones?

The Coby 4 GB Flash Video MP3 player enabled me to resist the compelling urge to drop $150 on a video iPod.  While the software isn't as elegant as the iPod, the Coby unit includes a simple text reader and an FM radio.  It shows up on my iMac desktop as an addressable drive, allowing me to move files in and out of its memory without touching iTunes.  It also syncs with Windows Media Player and includes a simple (if imperfect) Windows-only formatting utility for importing video with the proper aspect ratio and file format (.avi.)  I have downloaded TV shows and full-length movies (Ben Hur!), etc. and viewed them on the little screen - a very neat trick when ultimate portability is the goal.  

The text reader mentioned above accepts .txt files only.  This means it is handy for off-line reading of any long document that can be saved in that format, including web contents, Word documents, and most of the free online books.  (James Joyce/Ulysses is on there now).  

The mp3 functions are comparable to other mp3 players, although I haven't yet bothered to figure out how it assembles playlists, etc.  Surprising to me is the inclusion of the FM tuner, something that adds real value by connecting me to the real world instead of isolating me from it.

The touch-screen interface is really quite fun to use, and in principle, trumps Apple's much-vaunted touch wheel.  Using my wife's iPod seems so low-tech and old-fashioned to me now.  In actual use, the touch screen is a bit too small and sensitive to be ideal - it's just too easy to touch buttons inadvertently.  There is a "hold" setting that inactivates the buttons, however, even with "hold" invoked, if the function buttons are touched, the display is interrupted with an on-screen message that tells you that "hold" is turned on.  It's an unnecessarily intrusive interruption.  

All in all, though, for less than $50, this player is my new best electronic friend and constant companion.  I am never without a book to read, music to listen to, or a movie to watch.

Keurig B70 Gourmet Single-Cup Home Brewing System
I am completely hooked on this coffee maker and have deep admiration and respect for the Keurig company who promise EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE and stand by their word. Amazon permitted me to search for a better price than what the manufactuer offers which just completed a perfect package. The convenience of not having to dump out coffee grounds over and over during the day -- as well as the ability to always have "at the ready" any family member or guest's preferred type of coffee, tea, or chocolate is well beyond any concern of cost of the little Kcups. And it sure saves money by not having to "pick up" a favorite coffee drink at the local preferred coffee drive through! Thank you Amazon and thank you Keurig!

I bought the HF100 as a replacement for the 720p Sanyo Xacti HD-1.  The Xacti is compact, but has poor video quality indoors, its smallness results in a lot of camera shake, and it required repair after a few months, indicating poor manufacturing quality.  The Canon HF100 kind of fits in a jacket pocket or in the side pockets of baggy pants or shorts, but it weighs down your clothing significantly.  But the key point is that the video is stunning when viewed on a 24" 1920x1200 computer monitor.  The sharpness is incredible, with good sensitivity for indoor movies. Image stabilization is pretty good as I was able to obtain sharp images of craters on the moon at full zoom.   I was pleased that iMovie '08 recognized the SD card immediately and I had no problem transferring and playing movies on a high-end desktop (Mac Pro 3.2 GHz).  The 24p mode seems like a gimmick given that you have 30p, and the "cinema mode" merely gives you less saturation and the appearance of  higher dynamic range, which is useful in sunlit situations.  I like the video light, which is quite strong, and I consider an "effect" a la the Blair Witch Project.  I wish that these types of camcorders had a better built-in wide angle capability, but the wide screen aspect does give you back some of that in the horizontal direction.  Also, a 2-yr old SD card that I had worked fine, but could not record at the very highest data rates (yet the picture was still very sharp).  Photos are very good, rivaling a 7 MP Kodak point-and-shoot that I recently bought (V712), which goes to show the benefit of having a good Canon lens.

Melissa Miller's analysis of Breaking Dawn is very much in sync with my own thoughts. Every element and challenge in BD was seeded throughout the previous three books so that the story moved smoothly and excitingly to its conclusion.

I especially enjoyed the third section where vampire Bella comes into her own. All of Bella's admirable qualities - bravery, compassion, determination and love for family and friends - are logically enhanced along with her special "blocking" ability. She is the same Bella at heart and happily, the klutziness is gone. 

All of her relationships continue to grow in a way that is consistent with her previous feelings and experiences. The development of her relationships with Edward, Renesmee and the Cullen family are particularly wonderful and satisfying to read. As we all hope to do, Bella continues to grow and at the end of the book we know that growth will continue.

After all the struggles in books 1-3, I think a happy ending was an entirely reasonable pay off and one which I enjoyed immensely.

Hi Everyone,

Last Friday Tazz (our male cat) was attacked in our yard by a loose dog, needless to say I rushed him to the hospital Friday afternoon and upon the initial examination, the vet did not find any external damage. The next day I gave Tazz a bath because he was covered in urine from the attack and that is when I noticed a lump on his right rear hip. I took him to another emergency hospital at which they did an ultra sound of his hip and found he has a hematoma / fluid in his hip.

The vet gave me some anti-inflammatory liquid to give him but he is still in pain and you can see it when he tries to jump or climb. In addition, his whole demeanor has changed to being scared of the slightest noise or movement. He hides frequently and does not talk / meow anymore.

My Veterinarian recommended Feliaway Spray, which the Veterinarian said, would help with his anxiety in addition to helping him heal from the emotional trauma of the attack. I received the Feliaway today in the mail and after spraying it on a couple of places where Tazz frequents, I must say his attitude is very much improved. I would HIGHLY recommend this product even though it is a bit pricey it just takes a WEE BIT for it to have an effect. Call it aromatherapy for cats, whatever the case if can help a cat after a dog attack then I say it's a product that deserves high marks.

This hair dryer meets & exceeds all of my expectatations, but the diffuser is OK.

The speed & heat settings are great, the noise level is pretty low - it does a fantastic job drying - seems to be much more even than my last dryer which left wet sections next to near-burnt sections.  Sometimes a product will have a 'high' and 'low' setting, and there's not much of a difference.  In this case, it's really nice to actually have a low setting for the diffuser.

I have a ton of curly hair, so I feel that the diffuser is quite shallow in depth compared to the last one I owned - my hair kinda spills out instead of sitting 'in' it.  However, the shallow diffuser shape seems to be the trend, so unless you have an old-school one that fits over the nozzle, I don't know that you'll have much of a choice in new dryers.

I would highly recommend the dryer, and say 'meh' about the diffuser.

This is the most practical book I have ever read on productivity. As a single woman who works from home, but has a highly pressured position together with various other commitments, I have always found time management books and tools fall short of real life. 

This book brings it all together in a way that is easy to manage all you need to do - whether a task in line with your life's purpose or just the mundane of having to mow the lawn! For once I am in control of all my stuff and it is really AMAZING to experience the creativity that has suddenly been unleashed after getting all my stuff from my head to my list.

I have had this card in my PDA now for about two weeks.  Installation was straight forward and card does work as advertised.  I am using is with an IPAQ 1940 running v4.2 of pocket PC.

The Good:
-installation was simple
-card recognized with no problem
-it has expected range for something so small - and in general I think the range is very good
-works everywhere I have tried - my home network, public hotspots, etc.

The Not So Good:
-using activesync can be hit and miss - sometimes when I plug in it works and sometimes I need to eject the WAN card and reboot the IPAQ - I can't say I have spent too much time getting to the bottom of this and the workaround is not too much trouble
-I do find myself resetting the IPAQ more often then before the card, but this is not because the system has crashed but because it has stopped recognizing the WAN card - again, I have not spent much time troubleshooting this and I do not find it that much of a problem, just a little inconvenient

My final thoughts on this are that it works great, it's not perfect, but I paid about $20 for it and it was way cheaper than buying a new IPAQ with built in wireless networking.

The Day the Earth Stood Still

From a view of deep space, a familiar voice starts to sing a familiar old song from a familiar old musical, as the song builds, the camera zooms in on the Earth, then fades out till you see that it's coming from a tiny little robot all olone on a wasteland Earth of the future. Thus, in the first moments of the new animated film from Pixar, you get an immediate feeling of...awkward weirdness. This move is not what you would expect. Sure, there's fantastic animation from the server farms at Pixar, cuteness galore, and a family-friendly, feel-good story to be found. However...

For the first half-hour or so there is only one character to be found, the namesake of the film, a cute little robot who goes about his day compacting trash, and stacking it into SKYSCRAPERS of crushed garbage, all the time collecting knick-knacks and entertaining himself listening to his music from his favorite musical, which he watches in a little robot home he has fashioned. Really, all this is just to give us a very strong picture of what the world has become and what the personality of our pint-sized hero is. His treads roll through the abandoned metropolis where giant stores and billboards advertise for a super-corporation nation's products, slowly cluing the unaware in to the fact that humans consumed everything on the planet, produced garbage until they were buried in their own waste, and when the Earth was reduced to a lifeless junkyard where no planets can survive and acid rains from the sky and dust storms destroy everything in their wake, they left. Even worse, we can the remains of others of our protagonist's kind along the way, reduced to scrap. This could be REALLY disturbing, especially for a children's film. Somehow though, that bullet is dodged by the little fellow who only speaks in what my father calls "robot baby speak". He is incredibly entertaining to watch, and incredibly cute. Even if you can't tell exactly what he is doing or saying, you like him immediately and watch everything he does. You are never bored of his one-robot antics as he compacts, collects, and then comes home to watch his movie and long for a companion of his own. And a companion he does find!

The Singing Dancing Robot

Little WALL*E finds himself suddenly no longer alone when a spaceship lands and drops off a probe robot to search for life on the desolate planet. At once terrified, curious, and enamored with the first FEMALE robot he has ever seen, cute little WALL*E jumps through many hoops to get EVE's attention (without being blasted by her excessively itchy blaster arm), and woo her with his accomplishments (I loved when she asked him what his directive was he compacted some trash and said "Taadaa!", as well as when he showed her his favorite movie and did a little song and dance). EVE is largely unimpressed with WALL*E himself (come on, he's ANCIENT compared to her), but indulges him, until her shows her his greatest treasure (the plant she has been looking for). After detecting the planet EVE completely shuts down, and WALL*E spends all his time trying to protect her, then follow her after she is picked up by the spaceship and taken back to the mothership. Naturally WALL*E is in store for a major shock as he enters the glistening giant starship, and quickly finds himself bumping into various robots and human inhabitants (who have been raised on a diet of heavy convenience and low interaction to the point of turning themselves into little more than blob people in a permanent state of recline). Everywhere WALL*E goes however, he makes a strong impression with his cute personality, and his built-in recorder which keeps playing at awkward moments with snipets of his favorite song (which comes to be the way that robots and humans identify him).

"G-I-V-E         M-E       T-H-E          P-L-A-N-T"

From there things go into the standard "heroes on the run while stopping-the-evil-plot" ploy, wherein the plant is almost destroyed, and then continually chased by a HAL-like autopilot robot determined that the ship must never return to Earth (which it will automatically do when the ship confirms that Earth-life exists). The discovery of this plot (and the recording of everything that WALL*E did for EVE while she was asleep) results in EVE's change of feeling toward the little guy, who had gotten both of them in deep trouble by making the security droids think they are going rogue (and it didn't help that WALL*E accidentally let all the nutty robots out of the robot psyche ward). Naturally the hero triumphs in the end and a happy ending awaits all with a feel-good message about saving the Earth and starting over again with a little love and willingness to work to improve things. 

"What is dancing?"

What makes this more than just an interesting movie (and takes it to the realm of a good film, possibly a classic) is the way that everyone and everything in the movie, except for the spokesman of that evil BnL corp (who keeps appearing in live-action video excerpts), and the evil red-eyed autopilot and it's minions, is basically kind and friendly and good-hearted. WALL*E accidently runs over his cockroad friend, and shrieks, but the cockroach is unharmed. When WALL*E bumps into some people and tears off their displays and headphones, they are more curious and surprised than annoyed. Little robots going about their jobs get irritated by WALL*E's dirt and antics, but grow to love him, just as EVE does when she sees what a kind soul he is. But what really nailed it for me was the attitude of the captain of the ship. 

"All you needed was some to take care of you."

When you see that he can't ever sit up without a motorized seat-back and a cup of coffee (after sleeping in till 12:30!), you might at first think he would be irked  by the hassle of the prospect of returning to Earth (heck, he can't even read the return manual!). But no, this guy is so used to only have one job to do in a day (tell everyone what time it is and what the weather is like) that he's really excited at the prospect of something happening. And as he slowly comes to realize that the world long ago was reduced to a wasteland because his ancestors sat back and did NOTHING as the world was destroyed, he galvanized to action and works with WALL*E and EVE to get the planet recognized and the ship returning to Earth. I love the scene where the captain examines the plant and slowly realizes world could have been saved long long ago if people had only tried to do something to help the world instead of destroying it in their greed. 

"WAL*E!!!!!"

There is a jarring transition when WALL*E goes into space. From that point onward, the movie feels far less like watching an actual robot moving through a desolate planet, and much more like watching a cartoon movie. The downside is that while the title character continues  to be followed throughout the rest of the movie, he doesn't seem to be the focus anymore. A fish out of water with a somewhat low IQ, poor little WALL*E spends the rest of the movie largely running and hiding from trouble, or chasing after EVE, all the while seemingly blissfully unaware of how bad the situation is getting. To its credit the movie keeps its momentum by being constantly entertaining and almost always humorous despite the shift in focus.

"EVA?"

From another point of view, you could find the second half of the movie to have an almost Forest Gump type of feel, as the title character is swept up in huge issues way beyond his understanding, but keeps trying to win the perhaps overly-sophisticated female by sheer persistence and good intentions. Poor WALL*E, even in a crisis, can only think about how much he wants to hold EVE's hand.

"You're all gonna become farmers!"

 The best advice I can give you for watching this film is to keep an open mind as I did, and not carry any expectations. Yeah, this movie may seem heavy-handed and soap-box-preachy in its environmentalism (and seriously anti-corporation to the point of almost anti-American to boot), and at times downright distrubing at times to litle kids (the autopilot electrocutes WALL*E nearly to death and he is nearly crushed to pieces trying to hold up the platform for the plant so the ship will return to Earth). But in the end the peril and sadness lead to a happy ending, and if you can swallow people living their entire lives in space returning to Earth (in reality their bones would  be crushed like egg shells), then this is one ultimately satisfying sci-fi trip.

This is a brave new direction for Pixar and Disney, moving yet closer to PG rated animated films, or at the very least films with intelligence and depth for adults rather than pure kiddie glee-fests. The anmation is fantastic, especially in the beginning, the sound work is amazing, if hard to follow at times as the robots speak in robot-baby-speak, and the music, pacing, plot, and flow are quite excellent. The only truly GLARING flaw in the film to me is that the song WALL*E loves is overused WAY too much, and I would have liked it if there had been a lot more variety in the songs instead of the same one over and over and over and...yeah. That and the way that so much of the music seemed to be completely LIFTED from Star Wars, 2001:A Space Oddessy, ect, (can't Pixar just have someone write some new music by now?). I do however, LOVE the start-up sound WALL*E makes when he recharges (I used to hear that start-up sound every morning myself and it brings back warm memories).

So there you have it, a brave new world of animation, a seemingly kiddie film with very adult editing (long stretch of isolation at the beginning and almost no real "talking" the entire film, great comedy and fun to be had, and a feel-good story with an important environmental message. Looking back on it now, this film is probably a must-own sci-fi classic....unless you're one of those people who rolled their eyes and walked out of Silent Running...

I loved this book! I got hooked on Stephenie Meyer's writing from Twilight and couldn't wait to get my hands on the next one. She didn't disappoint. Mrs. Meyer does an amazing job of mixing the mystical with reality to create a world that you want to believe exists. You fall in love with the characters; smile at their happiness, laugh at their folly, and cry with their heartache. Completely enchanting and addicting.

I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  Small, easy to carry and useful in the office or at the gym.  I had problems figuring out iTunes for loading the iPod. Somehow I would add stuff and then go to add more only to lose all I added the first time.  I prefer Windows Media Player for music loading but that doesn't work for iProducts.  Either way my wife loves it and we're thankful we bought the 2GB rather then the cheaper 1GB.  With devices out there holding up to 8GM its better to stay away from the 1GB.

This is a great camera. I have gotten a ton of compliments on it! In fact, after the ob-gyn was sewing up my wife from her c-section last week both she the surgical assistant and the anesthesiologist asked what it was and wanted to see how it worked. It is a fantastic product that is easy to use, small, and takes great video. Another feature that is fantastic is that I can plug it directly into my PC or Mac laptop and transfer data ti either one without trouble. I have also had great luck with SD cards. I have a 2GB Sandisk which works great (of course) and an 8GB Transcend card (from Newegg) that also works great. It is a relief that this thing is not a finicky product that only takes a specific brand of card.  

I have several minor drawbacks that, while present, do not take away from the core function of the product, which is a highly portable video camera.  First, the camera function takes good pictures, but takes a while to focus and complete the process.  It is surely not a replacement for my stand-alone digital camera. Also, the battery charger comes with a cord. I would much prefer if the charger plugged directly to the outlet like my Canon camera battery chargers do; I hate cords. Finally, the USB cord is not the standard cord that fits most other cameras and USB devices. It is a special cord that you need to have with you, you can't just use a single industry standard cable that works with your digital camera. Not that big of a deal, but a bit of a pain if you are traveling. 

Overall I am very happy with this product and recommend it wholeheartedly.

I cannot begin to count how many hair dryers I have bought so far but this is the one that I now know I can't live without! I have paid more money for other dryers, but none of them compare to this one and usually the more expensive ones don't last as long either! It is very easy to use and my hair shines when I am done drying. It is very quick also, I have very thick hair so what used to take about 20 minutes now takes about 10! I have not used the diffuser so I do not have a comment on that. And I agree that it is a little heavier than other dryers that I have owned, but like someone else said: Your not carrying it around all day! I love this dryer and really can not say enough great things about it!

My old router was simply too pathetic to support my needs, so I upgraded to this one. It really solved my problem. Reception is strong (54 mbps) and video streams from basement to living room just fine, even to my MacMini, which has a fussy location for its internal antenna. Setup was counter-intuitive. Normally, you stick in the disk and follow the directions. Not here. After you are done, and without a prompt from the install wizard, you have to go online to configure the router. Here the workflow was not obvious, the steps difficult to understand, and the importance and consequences of decisions not documented. Chosing a WAP key and implementing it was a pain. Tech support won't accept calls if the queue is longer than 10 minutes too. If you don't think you want to sweat this process out, buy something else.

This is a great electric toothbrush. The Bristles are nice and soft on my teeth. I was a little vary about ordering a electric toothbrush at first, but this one was a hit.  It left my mouth feeling nice and clean. The best thing about this brush is that it comes with a travel case, makes it very easy to travel with. Plus, when charged, this lasts for 2 weeks with out recharging, no need to worry about carrying the charger around!

I purchased the Cuisnart after seeing it in a local store.  When I saw the free extra freezer bowl - I ordered it here.  We had an old Rival maker that used ice and salt and was so noisy we had to set it up outside.  While this unit is not totally silent, it is a great improvement over the old Rival.  I absolutely love it for our low-carb treats and the kids love to make their slushies. We have a large chest freezer to keep our bowls in, but I could see someone with limited freezer space having a storage problem.  I think it's a great product for the price!

I called the manufacturer and they sent me a 3ft cable immediately.

They also said all current and future inventory of this product has the correct 3ft cable.  Great service!

I bought this trimmer for I believe it was 18 dollars on a random sale day I guess . I was looking at it for some time and when I found at at this price (with a coupon code), it was a steal. 
The trimmer itself is very well made and sturdy. The pieces come apart pretty easily and clean quickly. I absolutely love the vacuum function. As long as you trim relatively slowly and carefully it will pick up about 90% of the hair its clipping. A few little ones can get by the trap, but it is extremely efficient with proper use. 
If you are in a bit of a rush and trim quickly, it will of course miss a few more hairs but manages to still suck up about 70% of what its cutting.
The turbo mode is useful if you have a lot of hair you are getting rid of, but by no means a major factor. 
I am very happy with the purchase and if you have a decently full beard you like to keep trim, it is a great product. I would recommend it at the MSRP, but if you can, keep your eyes out and maybe you can find it for the absurdly low price I found it for...Good luck.

First of all, let me commend Amazon for such fast shipment.  It shipped Jan 2nd at 6:58pm and I was hooking it up on the 3rd at 6:30pm.

I've been playing with flight sims for all my life, starting with the good old Sublogic Flight Simulator II on Commodore 64.  Yes, that's 5fps and the plane sounded like a mad bumblebee, but it was afterall a flight sim.  I had FS98 for a while but got rid of it because I was into racing games.  Well, FSX comes out and I'm absolutely amazed that such a program could suck up 2gigs of ram and every last bit of processor at the highest quality graphics.

At any rate, I got back into flying.  Forget fast cars and shooting games, there's nothing like taking to the sky on a 15" widescreen laptop (the real thing's too expensive).  I was currently trying to fly with my Logitech G25 steering wheel...  Good for cars, bad for planes.  Yeah, I could "steer" but had no elevator control (unless I used the gas and brake as the "elevator" but that's not real).

Enter the CH Flight Sim Yoke USB.  This is the most SIMPLEST thing to install.  Just clamp it to the desk and plug it in.  Windows detects it and it's already calibrated.  I fired up FSX and without any major configuration, I was able to throttle up and fly.  Many of the buttons are also configured for you such as flaps, landing gear, flour bomb (LOL), directional hat, views, and rudder trim.  There's also an elevator trim wheel on the unit.

While it doesn't have force feedback, it feels very real.  The springs are very tight and you have to PULL to make the plane take off.  Flying is a breeze (pun intended) and feels as real as it's going to get on a computer.

My only complaints with the unit are the plasticy throttle levers and toggle switches.  They should have given the throttle some kind of resistance like a real one and those toggles should give you a good "click-click" when used.  I guess maybe a trip to Radio Shack and a little warranty-voiding might do it some good.

Plastic buttons aside, this is THE controller if you want to fly.  I know there are others WAY more expensive than $109.00 but this one is about as fun as it gets.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)

      



I am forutnate enough to not only own this gizmo, but to also have the Mino Flip. ( Very similar to this but different brand). This review will be a comparason of the two.

Vado comes with a soft silicone cover that is designed to wrap around the camera's impliments. Mino does not come with such a cover but does have a microfiber chinch tight sleeve.

Both use a sandard USB port to upload/battery charge. However the Vado is very poorly placed and the flexible nature of the cord makes it very awkward. The Mino's connection pops out and remains ridgid, enabling a more stable connection to the USP port.

The screen sizes are about equal. The funcitons and buttons are also quite comperable. Mino HD comes with just one record quality option for an hour; while Vado will record as high as HD+ for 2 hours or as low as VGA for 8hrs. I have not yet needed a full 2 hrs to test if this is true. 

For both products, uploading to your computer and viewing on a TV screen is fairly simply. The Mino comes with the colord three progned cord/plug ( dont remember what it is called) that goes into the standard ports in the back of your TV. The Vado comes with a USP type adapter that goes into an HDTV port. (slightly less bulkey then the Mino's method)

Vado and Mino are equal in size and weight. Both are a blast. Everyone thinks you just have a measely little cell phone and are quite impressed to learn you have an HD video camera. It is great fun for gatherings. Hope this helps you choose.

Just purchased this camera, and thought I'd mention some points that I haven't seen elsewhere - so far I agree with ALL the very positive reviews for this camera.  I'm only mentioning small negative points here because it's obvious from reviews that this camera is great for most users, so I just want to put up any small points that may annoy some potential owners.  I'm a performer and use my video camera exclusively to tape my shows, so my needs are very specific.

* Something I had to hunt for - if you rename the MOD files as MPG and then use Windows Movie Maker you'll need to force the 16:9 by going to TOOLS -> OPTIONS -> ADVANCED -> ASPECT RATION and choose 16:9

*  The door to access the SD card is on the bottom of the camera - that means if it's on a tripod you have to take it off and possibly remove the quick-release plate to open the door.  Even if you buy a big enough card to shoot continuously, you might have to remove the quick-release plate to pull the SD card out for transfer to the computer (if you transfer via the SD card instead of through the cable)  This is a small annoyance because I like to just leave the plate on the camera, after all that's the whole purpose of a quick release plate.

* When you plug the camera into the computer it forces you to plug in the power, even if you have a full battery.  That makes no sense because files transfers usually take less than 10 minutes, and the battery lasts for hours.  Just one more little annoyance that makes things more complicated, you have to dig out the charger every time you want to transfer files via card.

* It would be nice if the prongs that plug the charger into the wall would fold down into the charger instead of being fixed in the "out" position.  A minor point, but it does make it that little extra bulky in a small camera bag.

*  It shows you the audio levels but doesn't let you adjust them (I thought it would) 

*  The MOD files - yes there are work-arounds that people have wonderfully shared here  (rename them as MPG, force the 16:9 perspective, etc) but the bigger question is why the heck should we have to - if a MOD file is the same as an MPG file, why don't they just call it an MPG and save us the hassle?

This book is AMAZING. Stephenie Meyer continues to impress me with her talents. The book came in excellent condition and arrived exactly on the day it said it would.

</review>

<review id="1624">

As the plot line increases, the description of this series being a Harry Potter on estrogen appears to be more fair than not.

Concepts, style and presentation are extremely similar.  But, this is not an equal to the beloved Harry Potter. Bella is just a fine replacement of the boy wonder. During Harry's absence, booksellers worldwide ask or have asked: will there be another to that sells in such volume to make my store turn a profit for the year? Stephenie Meyer apparently has responded in the affirmative.

Although there is nothing as sinister as Voldemort - James begrudged mate, Victoria, is nasty.  No one is as knowledgeable as Dumbledore, but Carlisle has his cool and calm demeanor and may be wiser than we think.  In medieval Volterra, the leader (Aro) is as powerful as Voldemort or Dumbledore, and is neither good nor bad - he is something in between. And his sidekick, Jane, is still unknown and may be bad or good - something like Snape.  The protagonist's new best friend, Jacob or Jake, is growing into his new found talents, like little Harry, and trips over things too often like Ron Weasley. It all centers upon a high school attended by werewolves and vampires. You can get the idea. There is something deja vu about this book.

But, it also is different from unequaled Harry and friends.  The dialogue is more like Evanovich than Rowling. The occasional cute quips are. . . well . . . cute.  You get a laugh every so often.  And, that is one strength of this and the other novels of the series.  All the laughs with Harry seem to be with the Weasley boys and Hagerich - here it is more spread out. Everyone can jest.

Delivery of the quixotic death-defying moment in the last few hundred pages (another Potter similarity) makes the adventure heighten in the end, and the post-stressful event period when the good guys congregate to attest to their good fortunes of not having blown this book's next-to-last scene ends with a peculiar and contrarian request by beloved Bella - forcing you to read the next novel to see if it will turn out the way you think it will turn out. Something the booksellers adore.

And, Meyer knows her audience.  To assure pleasure for her reading public - preteen and teen girls - there are enough boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy regains girl (or is it girl meets boy . . .?) chapters or scenes to make even the seemingly heartless Grinch's heart palpitate a few times more per minute.  They are tender, G-rated, and truly innocent.  There is some kissing, but only by those who are in true love.

The science fiction of vampires and werewolves mixed with young people attending high school is not an automatic best seller.  Meyer earns her pay by writing rich dialogue which seems believable - most of the time.  And, if 110-year old Edward (who looks 17 years old) occasionally says something only a Ph.D. from Harvard could say, you take it with a grain of salt as he once did  attend Harvard and is so long in the tooth that he must have absorbed some wisdom during his life's incredibly long journey.

I recommend this product to all new moms without hesitation.  This product is awesome!  My baby slept for much longer using the Swaddleme.  I'm only sad that my baby has outgrown the size large at only 15 pounds (at 4 months), but he seems to have lost the startle reflex, which is the reason he badly needed the Swaddleme in the first place.  This is one of those items that is a "must have," and I will be buying for all baby showers.  I tried another brand of a similar blanket and wasn't nearly as impressed; the velcro did not stay attached.  The microfleece is warm and washes well.

I love this book (don't get me wrong), but it was defiently my least fave of the series. Probably because Jacob made out with Bella and Edward didn't show any hint of hurt or anger with her or even him. He didn't care. I am glad that Edward will do anything to make Bella happy but it would of been better if he felt something. And it made me even more mad that she was in love with Jacob. Gosh. Bella has some serious issues. lol :D

Season 1 and 2 was great, and I had no doubt in my mind that Season 3 would be also.  The only thing that seemed a little different from the first 2 was that Dexter seemed a little darker.

FIRST OF ALL
It boggles my mind how fans of this show can give this show a zero and try to defend their rating by citing lack of quality.  Is it true that this season wasn't as consistently strong as the stellar Season Two and the classic Season Three, but there is no way that this deserves such a low rating by anyone's standards.  While the beginning was a bit of a letdown, it is still overall a strong and hilarious season.

POSITIVES
+ Despite what the other reviewers said, it still feels like "The Office."  Whatever faults the early episodes have--and they do have faults--are gone by the second half of the season.  The second half is filled with episodes as funny and touching as anything that has come prior.
+ The character arcs were handled nicely.  I loved Pam/Jim, of course, and I loved the emotional roller coaster than was Michael/Jan.  A lot of great stuff goes on between all the characters actually--even Andy.
+ Risks are taken a-plenty.  Two main characters have left the branch.  One of them has left the cast altogether, and the other has moved up to a position of power.  By the end of the season, a worker will outwardly defy Michael, a cast member will go to jail, and another worker will leave the office for good.
+ This collection also comes with a script ("Dinner Party"), which was a wonderful surprise.  I'm a screen writer, so checking out this script was an essential and revealing look into the mechanics of the show.

NEGATIVES
- The first few episodes feel quite off, and I think these are probably the main reasons people rate the season low.  Both Michael and Dwight act even more outrageously than usual in this episode, and the plotline with Dwight and Angela's cat was really pushing the limits of believability.  Also, the first four episodes were hour long ones, so the dynamic of the show--short, punchy episodes--felt a bit off for a while.
- The comedy seemed more slapstick than before, what with the car going into the lake, the mushroom incident, and the Meredith being hit by a car thing.
- I'm as big a Pam/Jim fan as there is.  They are the couple I am very much rooting for; but I felt that Karen was sort of tossed aside without enough plot focusing around it.  It made Jim, as a character, seem sort of cold.  I loved their interaction when they finally crossed paths, but it did seem a bit too little, too late.

BEST OF THE BEST
1. The Deposition: Michael's best "that's what she said" jokes yet, along with some really heartbreaking stuff
2. Goodbye, Toby: "The Office" has never been able to match Season Two's "Casino Night" when it comes to season finales, but this comes close.
3. Branch Wars: Jim gets sucked into Michael and Dwight's antics, which leads to an awkward moment with an ex.
4. Dinner Party: Michael's home life explodes
5. Did I Stutter?: Ironically enough, I came to respect Michael as a boss in this episode.

OVERALL
Good season.  Not the best of the series by any means, but still a very entertaining comedy.  Fans of "The Office" will like it a lot, and new fans will be hooked in.

I'd just first like to point out that I did not buy this product because I have digestive issues. I'm pretty regular as far as that goes. I purchased this product to compliment a total body detox/colon cleanse I did for five days, and overall, I was pretty satisfied with the results.

During the cleanse, I followed a strict diet of fresh fruits and veggies, brown rice, water and all-natural fruit juices only. The first day, I didn't notice any changes, and was worried the product wouldn't flush me out, but then I increased my dosage to 2 capsules twice a day, and that did the trick. I did experience some cramping (and gas - not sure if that's normal) with this product, but nothing that couldn't be tolerated, and with a four-per-day dosage, I was having 3-4 bowel movements per day, which is what I was hoping for for a really cleaned out feeling. 

It's been a few days since my cleanse, and I'm pretty happy with the results. Not sure if it's because of this product, or because of the diet, but I would definitely use it again. I definitely feel like it cleaned out my colon, that's for sure.

A low budget film that makes you feel guilty about how much you enjoy it.   It's goofiness wedded to clever and made live and wonderfully laughable by a terrific cast and good directing. It's just plain FUN! Buy it. Sit back and enjoy. My only complaint is I wish it had been longer!

This thing is great.  It pulls out hair like its going out of style.  The only problem I found after using it for a few months, is figuring out when to stop pulling out all his hair.

I've been very happy with the Salton yogurt maker since I purchased it a few months ago.  I also bought Sonia Uvezian's "The Book of Yogurt" and from the start followed her recipe for yogurt instead of the machine's instructions.  Also, another reviewer recommended switching out the plastic yogurt container that comes with the machine for a quart size glass canning jar and lid.  I wouldn't have bought this machine if I hadn't read that review since the use of plastic for the yogurt container is also my complaint.  Thanks for the tip, the glass jar works perfectly.

This is Apple's best iPod to date.  Why? One word, GENIOUS!!!!!  This feature enhances your musical library and offers an array of playlists to diversify your collection.  To me it's worth the price alone to upgrade.  I drive my iPod on my Sony A/V Receiver using the dock and Belkin stereo cables and it cannot perform better.  OK, so Apple wants to sell this iPod and is not offering updates on previous generation iPods.  How can anyone be surprised, this is Apple!!  They can't even include a USB outlet plug w/ a $250 device.  They're the ultimate capitalists and you know what, we'll pay anyway!!  Overall, this device does exactly what I need it to do, store mass amounts of music and play with exceptional sound through my Sony 5.1.  I'm not looking for a device w/ a FM tuner or a WI-FI connection, I seldom carry around my iPod.  My preferences are: 1. Great digital interfacing and visual effects.  2. Durable product.  3. Reputation.  iPod classic has all these and more.  A couple of minor complaints.  I wish Apple gave you multiple versions of playback graphics instead of the cover album to the left and artists/titles to the right, I would prefer just a large shot of the album cover.  Finally, cover flow could have graphically looked more enhanced and no accelerometer?  That's their next upgrade..

I received the Flip MinoHD as a gift and I never thought I would have so much fun using a camcorder!  I always thought of myself as more of a still picture person because I didn't want to be stuck filming behind a big bulky camcorder.  But when I'm filming with the Flip it's so small that I almost forget I'm filming!  And the Flip is so simple to use that I picked it up and was using it 5 minutes later, and I've been able to hand it off to lots of different people with different levels of tech savvy and they've all picked up operation of it with no trouble.  

In addition to the ease of operation, the other advantage of the Flip is the great video quality from such a small camcorder.  The video looks great on both a computer monitor and a full size TV (I've watched it on up to a 42 inch widescreen).  I took the Flip on a recent trip to the theme parks in Florida, and I filmed everything from rides to fireworks, and it all looks great.  And the video is so easy to share--just plug the Flip into a computer and share--that it makes it easy to share everyday events with friends and family.

My only complaint with the Flip is that it only takes 60 minutes of video at a time.  But it's not a big negative for me compared with all of the great features of the Flip.  

I would definitely recommend the Flip to anyone looking for an easy to use, compact camcorder.  It's a great addition to my memory capturing toolkit, and gives me a reason to take great video everyday.

My girlfriend has a Border Collie who sheds non-stop.  She has some other brushes, which I've tried, but they don't collect much hair.  And after brushing the dog it still shed just as much.  Enter the Furminator!  Since the dog spends a fair amount of time at my house I was desperate to figure out how to stop her from covering my carpets in dog hair.  I forget how, but I found the Furminator on Amazon and saw all the 5-star reviews so bought one right away.  And it hasn't let me down.  The dog seems to mind it less than the other brushes and it takes out a lot of her hair.  She still sheds a bit but so much less than before.  I like it so much I just bought a 2nd one for my girlfriend's house.

I read all of Amazon's reviews of the Cuisinart Smartstick Immersion Hand Blender and I compared them with the reviews of other comparable products.  I am so happy with my choice to purchase the Cuisinart Smartstick.   Now, my children can have smoothies and shakes every night and all I have is a two minute clean up!  I used to shudder when they asked for smoothies since for me, the predominant image conjured by their requests was a big blender with a rubber ring inside and a tight grip that I had to struggle to undo.  Then I'd have to stick my hand in toward the blade just to be sure it was clean.  Additionally, the smoothies rarely came out good.  They would leak into the base of the blender, pour out with chunks of fruit and ice amid the liquid and the whole mess just didn't seem worth it.  Now, I just pour the ingredients into the container that comes with the Smartstick and with no mess, we have perfect shakes and smoothies.  As my husband would say...bingo, bango, bongo...shakes are served!  I am thoroughly enjoying the Cuisinart Smartstick and have already recommended it to friends.

After reading all the reviews on Amazon I decided I needed this toaster.  Had been looking for one with all the features this has and was not disappointed.  I love toaster strudels, but they usually came out burnt on outside & still half frozen on inside til now.  Bagels are really good as are English muffins.  Can't believe how even it toasts just regular bread.  I love the slide out crumb tray--no more crappy crumbs all over the sink & trash can.  I remember toast like this makes.  Didn't think I would ever find a toaster that really makes old fashioned real toast.  Do not be afraid of the negative comments--this thing works great.  Buy it.

I agree with the previous reviews: it's an average still camera but a really sweet video camera. Its main plus is its small size (about the size of 70-80 stacked playing cards), which is also its primary disadvantage. The buttons are tiny, the viewfinder is tiny, but the camera is tiny and the video looks great. It's too heavy to be a shirt pocket camera but it feels solid except for its plastic battery cover door. For a case, consider a Pelican 1010. The camera and strap just fit in the case which is waterproof and crushproof. I carry it hiking as a video camera and emergency still camera.
Start off with at least two batteries.

I saw this on HGTV in some trendy house renovation shows. And, I did not know what it was but it looked really cool. And, when I saw it on [...] later, I realized that this is an ancient kind of product we all are familiar with. 

My excuse to buy this was that my house is under the hammer and we decided to chuck away the old gas stove. And, that means we can only eat frozen meals heated up in the microwave or this coil burner.*w*

Unlike some other reviewers expressed, I have only used this for boiling pastas, or stir-fried dishes. And, it was just amazing that how this $15 burner can cook as well and fast as my GE electric stove in my other condo. I have cooked  some Chicken Soup for 4 hours one day, which turned out great as well, so I don't agree with other people's discontent myself. 

 I just wish I could put 4 of these coil burners when the house is complete instead of purchasing a couple of thousand halogen cook top. At least, a young couple on HGTV did it in their compact loft condo this way. with the coil covers, very clever! I think it looks good enough to keep it on the counter top. 

The only flaw is that the spill plate under the heat coil leaves the burn marks from cooking if you don't wipe them immediately. But, then again, I could buy another without thinking! A very good value.

I'll keep this one short.  My dad picked up one of these Acer Aspire Ones about 5 weeks ago and fell in love with it. He's a power user and traveler. Took it to Africa for 2 weeks in Jan.

Excellent connectivity, clear screen, good speed, etc.  I haven't tried pushing it's limits with software, but I didn't buy it to replace my big bad Graphics PC or my full size laptop. I got it for internet and simple documentation. Still, I'm pretty sure that if I decide to do some PowerPoint or the like, it will do just fine.

As a near 15 year old girl, my opinion might be a bit biased, but I absolutely love this book. The whole saga is amazing. It's a lot more interesting and complicated than a girl falling in love with a vampire and their troubles. This being the second book of the saga, most of you must already be hooked on the series seeing as you're looking to buy the next one. But for those of you who aren't, I really suggest you buy this. It makes a great gift to anyone who loves a great romance, mystery, and/ or fantasy. Everyone person that I've known who has read the first books want to read the next one. It's a great break from everything they make you read in high school as well.

I purchased the DNS-323 for our office to use as a central repository for commonly used files and to archive a number of files that we infrequently access.  We also added a pair of Western Digital WD5000AAKS drives to configure as a RAID 1 mirror set.  After the drives and enclosure arrived I followed the easy instructions to install the drives into the enclosure.  I then powered the unit up and connected via my web browser.  This whole process took less than a half-hour including unpacking the unit and drives, installing the drives, and reviewing the manual.

The first thing I did was to update the firmware to the latest version.  After restarting I went back into the configuration page.  Setting up the drives as a RAID mirror set was very simple.  The instructions were concise and accurate.  If you are using drives you already own, be aware that any data you have on them will be destroyed when either the RAID 0 or 1 options are used (as specified in the manual).  I created one volume for the files to go into since we don't need to set up different security levels for the people in our office.  After that was done we moved about 200GB of files onto the NAS.  This took most of the morning but we didn't have any problems whatsoever.  

Since I am familiar with Linux (which is the underlying operating system for this device) I opted to install the FunPlug option on the system before copying the files over.  You do not have to be a computer wizard to do this since the FunPlug community has very easy to follow instructions to install these additional features on the system.  Before setting up this enclosure you should investigate this wonderful add-on so you can decide whether it will help you by Googling "FunPlug" and reading the wiki for it.  I think that the optimized network drivers in FunPlug made a difference in the time it took to move such a large volume of data to the NAS since my initial tests before installing this option indicated that we did achieve better throughput.

I can recommend this product to anyone who needs a networkable storage device.  Setup with basic functionality is simple and quick.  If you would like to add additional features the FunPack community has great support and there are many add-ons for this device.  Due to the short time we have had this unit I cannot comment on its durability or manufacturer support but comments from other users indicate that these will not be a problem.

I started reading Twilight a week before Breaking Dawn came out, as soon as I knew it I had read all four of the books in a week.  I loved all of them and could not put them down.  I was very pleased with Breaking Dawn and was so relieved when none of the Cullens or The Pack were killed or hurt.  I found that while I was reading these books I felt so involoved that it would have been devastating if one of the characters would have been killed.  I also thought the pregnancy was a great twist.  Authors can only please some of the readers and if this book would have been different, there would still be other people complaining about the outcome. Stephenie Meyer got me to enjoy reading again and I will read everything that she ever writes.  I think that she is the best author I have ever read. I would recommend this whole series to anyone of any age, it is a great escape from everyday life and a great fantasy.  When the books were over it made me a little sad. I wish there could be four more books to read.   Heidi 33yrs Illinois

Q: Did the G25 make you any faster? 

A: I can't say it did. But, for sure, NOT any slower! LOL 

Q: Did it make you a better driver? 

A: I think maybe it might have. But mostly because I want to be a better driver!

Q: Is using a clutch and an "H" shifting pattern hard to get used too?

A: It was at least a week before I really can say I got used to driving using them. But "NO" it was not hard.

Q: Does the wheel feel the same as when you first got it? 

A: Yes and no. Yes it is still as smooth and easy to steer and shift now as it was NEW! In some ways easer, because I'm used to it!  

Q: Why do you think it's better to have a clutch peddle and an "H" pattern shifting? 

A: In one word: "REALISM"!!! But also you can shift from 4th to reverse in one motion, instead of "click", "click", "click" and "clicking" to get there! And my last three words: FUN,FUN, FUN!!!

I do like this little guy.  It's great for bringing to class and to the library to take notes and I plan to use it for traveling as well.  I haven't had any problems with the wifi or operating system.  I'm still getting used to the Linux but part of the appeal was that it was pre-installed and I'm trying to wean myself from the evil of Microsoft.  I have one big beef however.  I actually returned the first machine I received because the left ALT key and the left side of the space bar look like they are going to pop off.  I got a second machine (no hassles with the return at all) from a different warehouse and it was exactly the same.  What bugs me is that it's a keyboard, not something anyone should be having any problems with at this point in time.  It's not a new technology and they should have it down by now, regardless of the smaller size, it shouldn't be that difficult.

This is a great movie.  My mother and I watched it together.  She even liked it.  I was a big Kirk Cameron fan and I have to say it I still am.  I still think that he's a great actor.  I've the seen the Left Behind movie series and that was good too.  Im a BIG fan of the Kendrick brothers.  Their movies are great.  It was nice to see Kirk Cameron team up with the Kendrick brothers.  It was nice seeing a marriage portrayed in a real way.  Those issues are real.  Porn, money, and lack of help.  I was rather suprised to see how the movie started.  But it was nice to see the movie evolve.  I was glad to see this go more mainstream.  I can't wait to see what the Kendrick brothers do next.  I think they do extremely well for what they have.  Of course they don't do the big Hollywood special effects.  They are making these movies in Georgia.  The Kendricks make do with what they have.  Besides I think it makes it feel more intimate.  Give them time.  I bet the next movie will be even bigger than Fireproof.

We've had ours for about two years now with no problems whatsoever. I wash it by hand once a week. Once a month I dismantle the entire unit and put the parts (minus the pump) in the dishwasher for a good cleaning. If you do this make sure the dishwasher is set to air-dry. I also remove the slotted part of the pump that controls the water flow and pull out the magnetic impeller from time to time to clean the gunk out of there. This might help prolong the life of the pump.

If you are a gamer, this is a pretty strong headset and for the price, you can't go wrong. The ear pieces go around most of your ear, the headset feels solid while you are wearing it, and the sound is great. The microphone works fine, and the volume dial on the cord is useful. It's a standard mic in/headset out connection...NOT USB, which to me is a positive since my expensive USB set gave me too many problems. Sound is supposed to go through the SOUND card...not USB ports!

With two big golden retrievers, the two most important things to have are a good vaccuum and a good shedding comb. There was some dinky plastic thing advertised on TV that we thought might do the job, but then we read the reviews here on Amazon and saw that everyone was disappointed with it. On the other hand, the Furminator got five stars from everyone, so we bought it.

The old adage "you get what you pay for" applies here. This bad boy is RUGGED. It's a family heirloom, because it sure isn't going to degrade in my lifetime, even if I lived 150 years. The grip is solid and comfortable, and easy on your hands. The actual comb is perfection in its design. It comes with a plastic protector for the tines, which you'll find very handy. If you look closely at the picture, you can see that the handle is bolted onto the head with two big, solid screws. This thing is built like a tank, and it works marvelously for removing that fine "inner" fur (what we call "doggy down"). 

Just buy it, for the sake of owning something of genuine quality that will last through many generations of dogs. (People, too!)

I recently purchased this deShedding tool for my three pets, one dog, two cats, they all have long hair.  Of course, as everyone else, I read the reviews and thought "Right, heard this before".  But to my shock, I got it and have found that it is all true.  I have a Maine Coon, that is very touchy about being bushed, but he lays there while I am bushing him and doesn't get upset at all.  My Pom, also has a "lot" of fur and it has been great to keep the shedding down.  My son has two long hair dogs and I have been telling him about this item and I am going over to do his dogs for him to show him how good this product works.

This was like a dream come true. I'm a tea drinker, my husband is a coffee drinker. We even use it for other things like making oatmeal for the kids. I have gone through many tea kettles (forgetting they were on the stove!!) This was the perfect solution. Water is always ready, have three different cup sizes and the variety of teas and coffee is out of sight. What more could you ask for. 

The only draw back is that I have to order my tea from the web sometimes. The stores in my area only carry a limited variety of teas. Now for the coffee lover you can find different options from various places.

This is an excellent little machine that makes just enough icecream for my family and I know exactly what goes in it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the manual states the bowl will be ready between 6 and 22 hours. I tried using it after 6 and 12 hours. At 6 hours it did not do anything with the blended mixture. Obviously it was not frozen enough. At 12 hours, I got the outside of the mixture sticking to the bowl and the core of the mixture not churned/frozen. This may not be an issue for everyone, but with our freezer and our bowl it takes a good 20 to 24 hours of the bowl being in the freezer to get the icecream just right.

I found this blanket on a babycenter store and decided to purchase it from here because of the free shipping. I got it fast and I loved it! It looks like an expensive bag and when you open it , it is a big blanket which is very soft inside and waterproof outside. it is easy to wash and carry around! It is a very nice blanket and we love to go for a pick nick or just relax on teh nature with our baby.

I tried using this product with a westell dsl modem provided by my internet company. The software wizard for the netgear router didn't work properly. Tech support would not give me any support unless I first registered the product. Unfortunately the router had biffed my connection so I had a hard time doing that. The second tech support guy (who spoke just as bad english as the first) had me do the same thing over and over to no avail. Then after about an hour deemed the router defective. Which it wasn't. I finally figured out how to get by the wizard and get into the basic settings. 
One plus, is that this product works with my new IMAC g5. the box only listed windows support. The setup is html based so it works with any OS.

I bought the Cuisinart Smart Stick to replace my Braun immersion blender, whose plastic was finally cracking after 12 years (it still runs like a charm).  The Smart Stick is a nice elegant design with it's stainless steel.  The multi attachments are nice.  The food chopped does short work of herbs and nuts (can end up mincing too fine if you're not careful).  The whisk is scary.  I haven't yet figured out what type of a container I should be whisking in.  Tried whisking some pudding in a deep 4 cup glass measuring cup (2 cups of pudding) and ended up with pudding covering a good portion of myself, the wall and surrounding area.  I think you probably need to use the tall narrow container that the machine comes with, otherwise watch out.

It is working great for my purpose - as a RAID1 storage for documents/pictures etc... anything I want to ensure is kept safe and backed up.  So I can't tell how well it works for streaming videos.  My transfer speeds seem to be between 5 MB/sec and 17 MB/sec, and they usually are consistent - as what the speed it starts transferring at is the same speed it is when the transfer is complete.  My only gripe is that it seems to spin down the drives to save power, and so if you don't use it all the time, you have a 2-3 second delay when you want to access the drive again. (Could that spin down partially come from the WD "Green" 1TB drives I'm using?) Setup was very simple (didn't even bother to install the packaged software that "searched" your network for the NAS, I just figured out what IP it got from my router myself).  The UI for the drive was VERY similar to my D-Link routers. I wasn't able to have special characters in my passwords for the drive.. boo (maybe fixed in a firmware upgrade?) Overall, I'm pretty happy with it!

At first I thought this was a useless product since my husband and I know how to swaddle a baby with just a blanket.  But when our baby boy came home with us, we found that he loves to move his arms a lot to place his hands by his face.  As such, the ordinary blankets used for swaddling did not really work for him because he would always manage to move his arms and make the swaddle loose.  Then we decided to put him in the Swaddleme and it worked so much better for him!  The velcros made the whole thing secure and our baby slept better in them.  If you're ordering a few of these though, I would suggest you order the different materials for different temperatures.  The fabrics vary such that some of them may be too warm for the baby for warmer days, while some are cooler.  Just make sure you have the variety to allow for some flexibility.

I'm a college student so after my Gateway laptop crapped out on me I got fed up dealing with viruses and unnecessary hassles of another PC laptop so I decided to look into Macbooks.  I've had this Macbook for a few days now and I absolutely love it!  It's sleek, lightweight, and very simple to operate.  I've started doing some of my homework on here, which requires the usual Microsoft Office type stuff, and haven't had any of those dreaded "conversion" horror stories.  The two things that bothers me is the place keys on the keyboard shows smudges relatively easy, same thing with the monitor since it has a glossy texture.  Other than those minor things, I'm very pleased with this laptop.

After another endless bag of microwave popcorn, I decided to buy this inexpensive popper...and in the week that I have owned it, I have made popcorn every day. It is so easy, so fool-proof, and the results are amazing. Easy to clean (wipe out the interior), it makes the most delicious, crisp, light popcorn ever. After eating the popcorn from this popper, you will never want to eat the chemical-tasting microwave popcorn. And fast - faster than the microwave bag corn, and nearly every kernel pops...upbelieveable. I used the Mrs. Butter flavoring (okay, a few chemicals here) and popcorn salt and am in popcorn heaven. Try this, you won't be sorry - unless you're going for the chemical aftertaste, chewy, burned and unnaturally flavored stuff :)

Oh, and I just ordered 4 packages of various gourment popcorns over the internet - so many varieties to choose from.

Superb. Whatever good you hear of this film is true. It is timeless, hilarious, action packed, suspenseful, well characterised. It is not a fantasy film so much as THE fantasy film. One of the best things about it is the way it plays with romantic and fairy tale cliches, like the concept of 'happily ever after'. Now, I KNOW everyone loves Fezzik. But my vote is in for Inigo. I love Inigo. Don't get me started on him. Him, or Westley's chest muscles. I mean... ahem. There is incredible chemistry between the characters, which means that all the minor faults (like the springy floor showing in the fight seen between Inigo and the man in black) fade into insignificance before your delight at the plot and characters.I must admit that Cary Elwes is not great as a romantic, but in the ironic, wronged hero role, he is superlative. Mandy Pantinkin is a lovely Inigo, Robin Wright a warm (although not as silly as in the book) Buttercup, and Andre the Giant, although occasionally incomprehensible, is delightfully slow as Fezzik. Billy Crystal is also hilarious as Max the Miracle Man, who is VERY Jewish, and the villains are terribly convincing. There are some stunning lines too."If you haven't got your health, you haven't got anything" (Count Rugen)"My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die" (Inigo Montoya)"Your ears you keep and I'll tell you why" (Westley)"Rest well and dream of large women" (Westley)"I DIED THAT DAY" (Buttercup)and of course"As you wish" (Westley)Overall, really REALLY good. See it. I swear it's wonderful.

This little device continues to amaze me.  It is running the Enterprise Edition of MS Office without any problem.  Power is way beyond what I expected, XP is stable, battery life is excellent.  The unit is a great value.  Don't expect it to compete with a loaded tower, but it is way more than the average user needs.  I've been loading CDs onto a memory stick to get around the lack of a CD drive.  With a wireless keyboard and mouse and an external monitor it outperforms my main laptop.  My only complaint is that it seems to get confused when connecting and disconnecting from an external monitor and I have had to reboot it to get the screen to come up.

First of all, I really LOVE this series.  Saw it all on the Discovery HD Theatre channel 11 months ago and loved it.  Picture quality is even better from the HD discs with spectacular resolution and minimal digital artifacts.  I had read the product info and knew Sir Richard Attenborough did the narration for this set, but decided to take a chance and go with it anyway.  For me that was a big mistake.  Something about the tone and delivery of Sigourney Weavers narration just makes for a more satisfying presentation.  I have read that many people prefer Sir Richard's voice over ...  To each their own, but I do plan to order the Discovery channel version from their website and sell this one.

I think that this is one of the most genius ideas out there!  I hated cleaned the litter box 3-4 times a day, but now that I've bought this (I've only had it for a couple of days), I clean it effortlessly in half the time!  It took me a couple of times to figure out just how much litter to put in it, how to roll it, etc., but the extra "training time" was well-worth it!  My cats love it, and it actually cuts down the amount of litter they trample all over the house (with a mat, of course).  I'll keep you updated on how it works out for me over time.

My kids love to make tea and hot cocoa but due to the expense of the Ghiardelli cocoa and K cup teas we ahve been using the teabags we have at home and also Swiss Miss hot cocoa packs.  The best part is you have tea, coffee, cocoa instantly when you want it!! The Green mountain coffee is extremely weak, but the Timothy's Kona and Columbian are awesome--really rich, full flavor.

OOMA voice quality is superb. I have no issues at all. I had a couple of issues with the caller id and the answering machine but they were resolved by the ooma technical help promptly. I have decided to keep my ooma hub and even transfer my number. OOMA lacks certain features such as the call forwarding, simultaneous ring etc, but I hope they will continue to add features. Considering that you don't have a monthly bill, I think it is a great value. I would certainly recommend it.

Whether you are looking to create a winter wonderland of frozen snow for your next event or just really like to crush ice or other tiny things this blender is for you!

The Oster solid metal drive train tears though anything you put in the way and does so handedly. 

While it only has two blending settings I find that helpful and not as redundant as many other blenders. "Yes i would like my drink blended as fast as I can possibly have it, I am not concerned with the speed the blender wants to do it" If you are tired of dealing with second rate blenders that can hardly blend yogurt but you do not want to give an arm and a leg for a nice one this incredibly classy, professional blender Oster BPST02-B Professional Series Blender, Black is your best bet!

I wanted a drive to 1) provide backup between several Macintosh computers and 2) provide file retrieval when I was far away. The LaCie 500GB Home edition does these tasks very well.

The drive's HipServ software allows you to put an icon on the desktop. Clicking on this gives you almost instant access to the drive. But if you put the computer to sleep, then wake up later, the icon no longer works. You must re-find the disc. On 802.11b this is too slow. 

If the router has not been restarted, the DNS address most likely does not change. The icon should still work regardless of computer status. This would make this drive a nearly perfect product.

I am going to share with you my experience using this juicer for about 2 weeks making apple, pear and carrot juice,
First of all the set up instructions are easy to follow and you just need to clean it before you use it. There are only 5 pieces which is removable and all can be put back with minimum effect. Only one metal piece must be aligned.
I bought this because I believe this is the newest model with 5 speeds. For me it turns out I only use the most powerful speed (5). 
I follow the instruction for apple and pear and removed all the seed and keep the skin.
You must turn the motor on first before you put the fruit inside. I learn the best technique from other posters here. Put the pieces in and cover the mouth with your hand. Sometimes it will kick parts out very quickly. If it stops working by itself you will have to use the plastic push to slowly push the pieces into the blade. It is extremely fast. The best way to use it is to prepare all the pieces before you turn the machine on. Then grind it and get your juice. The machine overheats once after about 20 minutes of use. I have to cool it off for 15 minutes before it works again.
My machine has a small leak like some other poster said. I have to put a paper towel below the whole thing and to keep it clean.
The juice has a lot of foam and I have to use a filter to filter it before drinking. But it tasted extremely good. The carrot juice is much better than the most expensive one you can buy. I buy the carrot from costco for about 50 cents a pound and get about 7 oz of juice per lb. 
The cleanup is what most people hate.  All the parts are extremely easy to clean up except one. That is the blade with a filter. The filter is very fine and they provide a brush for you to clean. Here is my method. You must clean it within a few minutes after you finish using it. Assume you have not used it for more than 20 minutes. (I suggest you somewhat clean the filter a little bit for every 15 to 20 minutes use. You probably cannot use it for longer than that because the motor may overheat.) My best way is to quickly brush it in a big pot of warm water. Then soak and clean it with very hot water in a smaller pot. You must use the brush on both side of the filter and change water very often. Now I can clean it in about 3 minutes.
The noise level is not bad for me and it is just like a regular blender.

This review is from: The Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc Special Edition) (DVD)

      



Growing up in the 60's and early 70's my small town had access to three television channels - and two of them carried shows from the same network! The annual showing of THE WIZARD OF OZ in those pre video days was an eagerly anticipated event for kids that was discussed for days before and after even by jaded fifth and sixth graders.  I recently watched the film again with my own  child and was amazed by how well the story and the whole production holds up.  The film has much to offer still in terms of memorable songs and characters and it is so fun to find the humdrum citizens of Dust Bowl Kansas having fantasy counterparts in surreal OZ.  No wonder this movie is and will remain a film legend.

Ive read a lot of reviews, mostly people upset about being duped into buying half a season.  But it was released half way through the season!  How could you have thought that they would release an entire season before it was even aired. Also, the '2.0' should have been a good indicator!  YEAH it was a sleezy way to make a buck on the producers part because they will no doubt release a version 2.5 that has the entire season and of course every one who bought 2.0 will buy it as well..  But such is life.  At least its worth it. 

 The series is truely one of the best shows on TV.  It put a big ding into my social life by being aired at 10pm on Friday nights. I found myself either ending dates early to get home to watch it, or ditching my friends until after it was done!  People who 'hate' sci-fi, love the show.  It sucks you in and after one episode, you are hooked.  Ive almost bought 2.0 a couple of times myself because I missed some episodes, but have decided to wait until they release the entire season in one set.  

If you havent seen it in TV...BUY IT.  Its worth it and will leave you drooling for the release of the rest of the season. If you can wait, just pick up the sure to come Season 2 2.5 Complete, complete season when it comes out... probably some time in September in celebration of season 3.0!

Now this is a film for the whole family, and I don't mean that as a bad thing. This is a great film. Full of charismatic characters, great costumes and wonderful story. The first time I watched this movie was when I had borrowed it from a library. I thought I'd give it a shot since it was free. Never thought it would be this good though. I took it more like a joke at first, but then I realised this is infact a masterpiece. It is also a bit funny at times and is alot of fun to watch if you're into fantasy stories like Labyrinth, though not as deeply fantastic as Lbyrinth, this still is a great tale and must be seen. 
I think it's meant to be a story for kids, but it doesn't make it any worse, infact it's better than most movies you'll see today, if not all. 
Just get it, it's always cheap where ever you buy it, and is worth much more than any shop sells it for. It's a must have and I can't imagine what life would be like if I had never watched it.
It is one of the most important movies I've ever seen. Brilliant and unmatched.
6/5 stars, if I may rate it that.

This adapter is essential if you want to use an older serial port attachment with a new generation Mac.

The KitchenAid Artisan Series 5-Quart Mixer, Metallic Chrome is the best mixer I have had in the 53 years of marriage! It is a delight to use. I didn't think that we needed a mixer as I rarely made cakes or rolls because of our heart safe and dibetice diets. Previously our old mixer (another brand) burned out from making rolls. My Mother kept insisting that I needed a mixer. She bought this one for me. We are so happy that she insisted. The hook beater blends meat loafs, cookies, hamburger recipes so well that I don't have to use my athritic hands and does a quicker cleaner job. Also, it will help to make bread and roll recipes.
Buying this mixer would not have been a problem for us. We just did not know that it would be useful. It's powerful motor allows us to cook more than we thought we could.

For an inexpensive espresso machine this one is very solidly built. It can produce great espresso with thick crema and decent froth.  It also heats up very quickly.  However,it is somewhat of a challenge to get consistent results with this machine - even with 20 years of experience with 3 other espresso machines.  The directions say to tamp the coffee lightly and I find it needs to be very firmly tamped.  I also had to toss the plastic cover on the frothing wand and I still get medium foam rather than dense micro foam. The extra thumping, pumping noise while frothing is less than pleasant, but, annoyances aside, for the price I think it's a great value.

     There was hardly a glitch in this second novel of the Twilight Series. I mean, it isn't some starchy, predictably structured vampire-girl novel. The bond is so strong between the main characters that it's incredible to be apart of. 

 Meyer creates this utterly original, creative world that charms every sense in your being to just, feel. 

I was crying to my 1yr old brother, saying, (A bit of a Spoiler!)

"why? why did he leave her? he left me, does he know that?"

hahaa because that's how it feels. You feel like you're adapting the role of Bella, the main character, throughout each novel. you look through her eyes, crumbling and reviving in the gradual pace in which she does.

Now, I call that good writing. Very and almost too enjoyable. It's a bit like eating your favorite meal to heart's content without the calories or guilt. Just a whole lot of pleasure. 

By the way, for those who might've already have read it, do these lyrics not just click to how you felt at the moment for bella during and after the 'forest bit'?

I've been through a half dozen pedometers over the years, and never stuck with them because they were so unreliable. I finally found this one which is without a doubt the best and most reliable (accurate) pedometer I have ever used. I took it to the track, walked a quarter of a mile, did the math to get my stride, walked the quarter mile again, and it was right on the button. I have never, repeat never, had a pedometer this accurate.

You can also use the formula they have in the book to get your stride. I tried that first and was within a couple of inches. I re-adjusted it after I did the quarter mile.

Other great features: Simple to set up, great quality, the clip seems adequate, plus there is a strap with another clip that you can use to make sure you don't lose it.

If you're looking for an accurate, simple to use, high quality pedometer look no further. The engineer who designed the counting mechanism for this deserves a special reward.

I recently found myself needing to dust off my vintage Wacom tablet (ArtZ II), for an upcoming project.  It's been several computers since I've used the thing and so was dismayed to find that 'modern' computers can't be bothered with the lowly serial port.  What the hell is that all about??  Parallel port?  Fine, get rid of it - it was an eyesore anyway.  But the serial port?  Who's bright idea was it to do away with it?  I pay all this money, and I've got no serial port?  Ain't right!!  Anyway, I tried the PCI serial adapter card route and unbelievably it didn't work.  It installed properly.  Windows knew what to do with it, the Wacom software recognized the tablet during install, but the damn thing would not work.  So rather than wasting time in tracking down the source of the conflict, I took the advice from Wacom tech support and installed the Keyspan adapter that we are all talking about here.  His sole reccomendation was the Keyspan - that it was the only one he knew for sure would work.  I bought it, installed it, hooked up the tablet, and am now making pretty pictures on my computer.  

This is a high quality product that easily resolved a high challenge application.

I had intended to wait for the new Kodak "HD" flash recorder, but needed a camera fast for my daughter's play.
I picked this up and haven't looked back.
The picture quality (even on a large screen) is perfectly acceptable, even quite good. It'd be nice if it were wide format (which is really all 'HD' means for this kind of camera), but you have to remember... this is the 21st century equiv of the Brownie camera. Its for capturing memories, not making professional videos.

I've owned other cameras, and the thing they all have in common is that you never end up taking them along. Too big to throw in a pocket, and oh yeah... the batteries never seem to be charged.
That's the disadvantage of even the other Flips with the AA batteries. You're never sure you have a charge, and end up having to carry extras.

With the Mino, you just leave it plugged into a USB port and throw it in you pocket as you leave. 

The one hour of recording time perfectly matches the 1 hour of battery life. I've yet to need more than an hour for the kind of shooting this camera is designed for.

Get this camera if you actually want to build up a collection of clips you'll enjoy years from now.

BTW, it works fine with iMovie on a Mac.

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)

      



As I have stated in the title of this review, no film is perfect, but this is about as perfect as any comic-inspired movie has ever been. The only other films based on comic book characters that I have enjoyed this much were the original Christopher Reeve Superman and Spiderman 2. 

One true measure of this film's merit is the ridiculous scouring some jobless internet obsessed shut-ins have been doing. I found a web site with THREE PAGES of continuity errors and gaffes! How many times do you have to view a film to notice all of that? Seems like only a true fan would try so hard to dislike something. 

As for the film...

Though I can't believe I'm gonna type this, here... we... go!
I read a Stephen Hawking book in which Hawking attempted (possibly in vain) to explain how much scientists currently understand about our universe. In it, Hawking explains that any attempt to create order actually creates chaos because the energy expended in creating order rearranges molecules and heats things up which creates far more chaos in our universe than it orders anything. To put it another way. If my dvd collection is scattered all over the living room floor, the amount of energy sent out into the universe by moving molecules and the creation of heat more than offsets any structuring of my little world by having TDK in its proper jewel box. 

Well, this is my take on this movie. The Batman's attempts to "fix" Gotham City results in greater chaos and, ultimately, the appearance of the "clown prince of crime." Of course, nihilism, i.e. "we're all screwed anyway, so why try to 'fix' anything", seems like it would make a silly little movie that would only appeal to emo-rawk saggy-pants little Jack White wannabes, but wait there's more.

First off, our hero hasn't looked at the world from the chaos perspective until the Joker (and his butler) intrude on his fantasy of a future utopia. This actually gives the bat-suit clad vigilante something far more intellectual to ponder than "How can I get rid of all of these bad people?" 

Also, this is the first time I've seen a superhero movie where it is suggested that the "good guy" (Batman) may be too misguided to realize that someone he thinks of as "pure" (Harvey Dent) may actually be corruptible. 


SPOILER SPOILER 

SPOILER BELOW


One last thing I would like to point out is that there is one thing about this film that I am still not entirely sure about... (Hey, I said it wasn't perfect.)
When Batman jumps out of the penthouse window to rescue the damsel in distress, he leaves the Joker alone to entertain a room full of guests. Are we to believe that the Joker will leave without terrorizing these people since he has been unsuccessful in his endeavor to find Harvey? Isn't the Joker supposed to create chaos wherever he may roam? 

Oh well. Five of five. Without question. Sure to be considered a "classic" in ten years.

I bought this for an overweight cat. The vet recommended smaller feedings more regularly but it's hard for us to feed her mid-day. The controls are weird, as others have said, but I was able to program the feeder within a few minutes. Now three times a day food drops for kitty. We've noticed that she anticipates the feeding (can cats tell time?) and is waiting for the food to drop. She is less anxious about her food, as apparently she finds comfort in the routine. A bit expensive, but cheaper than the vet bills for problems from the cats obesity. And she is losing weight!

After researching "juicing" and the health benefits I decided I'd like to try it. The Breville is quick, easy to use and to clean. It is not very efficient at juicing greens which was fine with me...I had serious trouble getting the juice down anyway! It works great with fruits and vegetables and the juice is quite tasty. I am amazed at how much juice comes out of a carrot! My only complaint is that it forces grapes and blueberries out much to quickly to extract most of the juice; therefore it seems to waste more of the fruit. 

I have had it for over a month now and still use it frequently since my experimentation with the juice "fast".

I bought this as a bit of an impulse buy, as it is a very entertaining book.  I am on the board of a natural foods co-op, and am always looking for interesting books on nutrition.  It is simplified, yes.  But, I found the pictures and the little hints helpful, and honestly found most beneficial the "hidden" bads and goods in foods you might think are actually better or worse for you.  On the downside, it does focus mainly on fast food menues.  It also sometimes gets confusing in its assessment of healty, mixing in sodium and fats, that isn't always clear (at least to me).  I agree with some of the other reviewers, too, that it is a book that describes how to eat somewhat bad foods that are less bad than others.  I did find the ethnic restaurant layouts interesting, as some of the items I thought were healthy certainly weren't.  All in all, a very enjoyable and entertaining book!

I only drink a cup of coffee in the morning, so this makes the perfect amount-- no wasted coffee, no pot to rinse out, shuts off automatically, and works quickly.  The downsides: I make strong coffee, so I've found that the grounds work their way up into the holes where the water comes down.  If I use a paper filter in addition to the re-usable filter this is not a problem (but then the whole point of a re-usable filter is gone).  Also, the mug this came with is awful.  It has the dreaded plastic smell, and the stainless steel cover continually falls off of the interior plastic mug-- this has resulted in some spills and stains.

I bought the MSI Super G to use with a new computer I built just for streaming Amazon videos and Hulu type use. The computer uses a Gigabyte GA-MA78GM-S2HP 780G motherboard which is hooked to my 52" Sharp LCD TV using HDMI from its onboard video. The Super G works flawlessly with my Belkin PreN router from about 50 feet and two walls away. In fact, I find the whole setup perfect for the job.

I wasn't sure if I should buy the Super G at first because I'm using a half height case but bought it because it looked like it would fit even if I had to cut the mounting bracket down. The good news; it came with the full-height bracket as shown AND a half-height bracket. Nice. Thanks MSI.

I have had this for a month now, and it's great! Although it shows some signs of cheapness, it is well worth it. The controls are nice and smooth,and it's partly made out of metal. There are lots of buttons, and although it may seem confusing at first, reading the manual cover to cover will make it all understandable. None of the buttons come programmed, except for Toggle 1 which changes views and POV hat 1 which looks around. Lots of cool features come with the X52, such as a Multi Function Display which shows which mode you're currently in, the profile you're currently on, the date, the time, and, when you press a button, shows what that button does. It has a stopwatch, too. All the buttons and the MFD light up blue which is cool when you're flying in dim light. The SST programming software is extremely useful if you don't like the way the buttons came programmed. This is a wonderful flight control system, I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a quality product to fly with.

Pros: Smoothness, accuracy, flexibility, lots of cool features, MFD.
Cons: Shows some cheapness, not much besides that.

Got tired of boosting Starbucks' stock and began looking for an inexpensive single-portion coffee maker.  Saw this on Amazon, read the reviews and purchased it.  Have had it for a month now, and I'm truly pleased.  Very compact, and incredibly easy to operate.  Coffee nice and hot, stays so in the provided mug (if one keeps it covered) for a nice long time.  I noted complaints about coffee grounds getting splashed about, and this does happen occasionally (especially if one uses more than the amount recommended).  A quick wipe takes care of the grounds on the water dispenser, and if they get splashed into the reservoir I just run the thing once or twice without the filter and that takes care of the problem (this happens very infrequently).  I'm VERY pleased.  In fact, I'm enjoying a steaming hot mug of yummy homemade coffee as I speak.  Ciao.

Okay, the good: Battlestar Galactica is probably one of the best written shows, period. Not a big fan of the hand-held camera work and the matching effects that go with it (reminds me of some bad MTV wannabe filmmaker), but the writing, acting, and total story is compelling and engaging enough to sometimes overlook it. Guys -- just one episode with everything steadycam and dolly shots wouldn't kill you. 

Now, to everyone pissing and moaning about releasing the first half of the series... Shut up already! Universal has packaged about as many episodes as there were for the first whole season, and dropped down the price about $10. I'm *very* happy to get the first half on DVD simply to have no 'sci-fi' and 'tv-14' bugs, commercial breaks, or voiceover/time compressed/split screen credits. 

If you don't like it, wait for the whole season 2 six months or so after it ends. For me, this is just awesome. 

Universal -- Kudos. Ignore the whiners and examine the bottom line.

This is my second "netbook", the other being an HP Mininote with the 8" screen. I am happy with both, but the MSI is much closer to being the ideal compromise between size and features than was the HP. Although the HP has a (somewhat) better keyboard, the larger screen size on the MSI makes all the difference to someone like me with terrible eyesight. Indeed the screen on the MSI is just lovely; bright, clear, nice colors, and the icons and text stand out well. Even my wife was impressed by how bright it was.

Ergonomically, the MSI has a decent keyboard with good feel and tactile response. I am not a touch typer, but I am quick and accurate on the MSI. The only downside is the small size of the period (.) comma (,), and backspace keys, all of which are 1/2 sized. The trackpad is small but usable and I have had no trouble with the "rocker" (single bar) mouse button. I found the trackpad and the buttons to be better on the MSI than on the HP.

Performance so far is fine, using Word, Excel, and IE. Wireless performance has been fine and it is also a quiet machine, with only the faintest humming sound. 

All in all, I think I have found what I have been looking for, a nice, lightweight, capable computer that cuts down on the size, weight, and cost of taking a laptop on the road and to meetings. The first road test will be the end of next week and I am looking forward to having the MSI with me.

Now if Apple would only make something this size....

FIVE WEEK UPDATE:

I have now had the MSI for about five weeks and remain very satisfied. I have used it on road trips to NJ, on-campus at meetings, and even at my son's swimming meet. In all of these situations, the MSI has been a big boost to my productivity, as I would not have taken a full-sized laptop to these events.

Things I am especially pleased with include wireless connectivity (better than my 2007 MacBook at the same hotel) and ability to go several days on standby without losing any significant battery power. The screen and keyboard remain strong points as well.

Things I am less pleased with are more limited. The unit is "tippy" with the larger battery, but you quickly learn to deal with that. Otherwise, no real negatives as far as I am concerned. 

12 WEEK UPDATE

I regret I have had the first serious problem with the MSI, a faulty trackpad/mouse button. From what I have read on various MSI Wind forums, this is not an uncommon issue. In my case the left trackpad button no longer works and I have to return the MSI for repairs. Dealing with MSI tech support was only a fair experience; the main problems were registering the MSI on-line (just figuring out which model # I had and finding the serial # [located inside the battery compartment] were the main issues), but the phone call with tech support was hampered by language issues. I would do everything online next time.

Anyway, the MSI heads back for repair early next week (early February) and I'll note what the resolution was after it comes back.

POST-REPAIR UPDATE

The Wind was sent to MSI for repair last Tuesday and I got it back the following Thursday. Most of the time was spent in transit to California (I sent it 2nd day-they returned it UPS ground). The trackpad works fine, but I had to reinstall the drivers since I had tried re-installing Windows on Tech Support's suggestion. It would have been nice if they had done that for me, but I guess that's asking too much. Anyway, all software has now been installed and I am back up and running. I'l keep my fingers crossed this is a one-time event.

Acer has made a good balance in the compromise between size and function. This thing has plenty of power and is small enough to get lost in a suitcase. Even the power supply is down sized. I wish these had been available when I used to lug a standard laptop through airports and attempt to squeeze it between my gut and the seat in front of me to use on the plane. Reduced weight to carry and small size changes the whole travel event.

This computer is just what I wanted for traveling on my motorcycle. 6 hour battery life is an honest claim.  Built in wireless for use many locations on the road. Small keyboard not hard to learn to touch type.  Biggest error is hitting small enter and backspace keys. Screen is good quality and just barely big enough.  A lot more vertical scrolling viewing documents or web pages. Some pictures not all onthe screen at the same time vertically.

Loading software no problem.  Copy the CD to a thumb drive then onto the computer. Not having a CD or DVD drive minimal problem as on other computers I go weeks at a time without using. At some point may buy one to use with it but right now don't see justification for expense.

User manual is minimal.  I found out by accident the new features on touch pad by going to the touch pad web page. It is a "two finger" touch pad that can scroll and zoom. As a long time laptop user I am comfortable with the touch pad and do not miss the mouse but was unaware of the advancements in touch pad features. 

I have also hooked it up to a projector for Power Point presentations. It automatically adjusts to normal screen size and works fine. If massive power is not needed then a monitor, keyboard and external DVD wil allow this to function as a primary computer that travels.

I used this on my Shih Tzu and it completely cleared up her tear and saliva stains.  It took about 8 weeks to completely go away.  You could see the new stainfree hair growing in within a couple weeks.  I trimmed away some of the stains and let it grow until all was clear.  Her hair is white so it really showed badly.  Did not have any side effects.  Works great!

Let me 1st say the picture quality of the blu ray version is phenomenal and I would say the overall quality is the sharpest ever for an animated movie.  I would look closely at certain shots like at the beginning with Wall E at Earth cleaning up b/c its far by the best looking garbage I have seen.  

The 1st time I watched it with my three and a half year old and my twenty month old and they watched about the 1st thirty minutes and they were done never to look at it again.  They simply did not care for this movie and I think they enjoyed the beginning b/c the music and whats going on plays together and Wall E has a certain silliness at the beginning.  That is kind of where my three stars come from since my kids really didn't enjoy it that much and neither did I.  I would say it was cute but not great.  I would say rent it just to see it on blu ray and who knows maybe your kids will like it.

As I watched it I am pretty sure there are a few political themes in the movie as well as parts that I said "hey that might offend sensitive people" not me though b/c I really didn't care.  That kind of stuff doesn't bother me but I found myself wondering why humans would create robots that would have emotional responses to each other than again I could be thinking to much since this is a kids movie. 

I did like hearing the robots speak though and Wall E had that funny kind of stuff like you would see a kid do like put a bra on their face since they don't know what its for.The emotional response of the robots was conveyed pretty good simply by their eye work.  

I guess this movie is good as long as you don't think about everything too much like me since it is a kids movie.

I meant to give this movie 3 stars and I went back to fix it from the 5 but I can't so thats my explanation.

I was looking for a backlit keyboard and this one is great.  The lights are great for playing in a dark room and during the day when the lights make it hard to see the keys you just turn it off.  The two complaints I have is the wraist pad is worthless, because it caves in right where your right hand rests, bad design in my opinion and I don't even use it.  The other complaint is I wish you could elevate the back higher.  It seems almost flat even when you put the feet in the back up.  It's a great looking keyboard and the keys feel great when typing, nice, smooth and quiet.

I have tried everything, waxing,shaving,threading, u name it I've done it.
I used this product first time yesterday and it works miracles. Its much faster than waxing and gets even the tiniest hair out. the results are awesome... I would recommend this to anyone who has serious problems with hair growth. I was a little scared to use it, since alot of the reviewers said it hurts, and I admit it does, but just like waxing your body gets used to it after a few times.

The only thing I "didn't" like about this grinder was that it left a substantial quantity of loose/ground coffee in the grinding chamber. This old/stale coffee will mix with the next batch you grind.
Cleaning the grinding chamber with their little brush every time is a messy, and time consuming HASSLE (cleaned coffee goes to WASTE!)!

What I do to easily clean the grinding chamber, and save the coffee- 
After grinding a batch, and whole bean chamber is empty. 
I set the timer on "1", to let it run empty. While running- I tilt it forward & "sharply" slap the top, and all 4 sides- once. 
This will shake out an extra 1 tsp.+ of coffee, that is added to my brew batch!

Several years ago I got my first Kinston flash drive (128). I was told then that Kingstons were the best and I shouldn't buy the "cheap" ones you see in advertisments for $10 or $20. Later I got a second Kingston (512). Inevitably I filled them both up and I decided I wanted a 4GB flash this time. I did a LITTLE on-line research, decided I wanted to stick with Kingston. Went shopping at my local retail stores, couldn't find one. So I let a guy talk me into a SAN DISC. What a mistake!  I ended up returning it and buying this Kingston. I couldn't be happier!  You just pop it in and go. Just a tip - the cap snaps on the back end so you won't lose it!

I have coveted my mother's mixer since she got one when I was in high school.  I finally received one for Christmas a few years ago.  It's used a couple of times a month, on average, and sees heavy use around the holidays.  I use it for mashed potatoes, for breads, for hummus, and for whipped cream, along with the normal cookies and cakes.  I've never had a problem with it.  It's easy to clean and is very reliable.  It's heavy, so I don't have to worry about it tipping.  I like the classic lines and the blue color complements just about everything.

Our 4-year-old Goldendoodle would bark non-stop EVERY night (but only at night and only in the backyard - at deer?) for as long as we would let him -- so much that we thought someone would call the police.  I didn't want to stop him from all barking--just in the backyard at night and I didn't want to use anything that would inflict pain if it could be avoided.  This little birdhouse did the trick!  In one day the problem was solved.  It's been about 3 weeks and it's still working great!  I don't know if it would work for all dogs, but it worked for us.

Love this Panasonic Bread maker, its my second one.  I had another one that I purchased 15 years ago and lost a part to it I could no longer replace. I must say the new one is even better.  Bread comes out perfect each time, it has a setting for small, medium or large loaf. This is good if making for two vs making for a dinner party of six. Bread is best fresh but stored properly will last days. The best part is setting the timer the night before and having it start baking about the time my kids are getting up for school. They get out of bed much nicer when they smell bread baking for breakfast! I take that back the best part is that I am sleeping and baking bread at the same time..I recommend the Panasonic hands down over other brands I have tasted bread from. Its worth a little higher cost for the Panasonic.

Watchmen is often considered the comic book series which brought literary elements such as symbolism, heavy characterization and a basis drawn as much from the author's imagination as the last decade's issues of Time to what is thought as a kid's genre. I have not read comics since I was a kid and I loved the gritty series. Masked vigilantes have guarded high crime areas since the 1930s. Banned in 1977, they withered away or submitted to government supervision with the exception of the violent terror of the underworld, the outlawed Rorschach. It is 1985, the Comedian has been thrown from a building, nuclear superman Dr. Manhattan has been publicly disgraced inspiringm him to leave the planet, Ozzymandias has been shot at and only Rorschach sees an important pattern. But the main plot is just a vehicle to link the individual, flashback filled portrayals of masked heroes in the real world. They interact with actual occurrences as the notorious murder of Kitty Genovese inspired Rorschach to leave his menial job for vigilantism and the appearance of Dr. Manhattan put America in the lead of its nuclear arms race against Russia. They do not always do what is right as the madness of Vietnam inspired the Comedian to gun down a pregnant woman and anyone whose political believes include due process and anti-capital punishment sentiments despises the infamous Rorschach. They symbolize different things as the crime fighter, Ozzymandias turned philanthropist and renaissance man, Adrian Veidt spews Peale-style philosophy and the cold, withdrawn, omnipotent Dr. Manhattan considers if he is to help mankind of loom over it, symbolizing science in the nuclear age. I enjoyed the sharp differences between the characters' philosophies despite being compelled to do the same strange thing for the same goals. Rorschach beats a lowlife criminal timid, thinking "New York is dying of rabies. All I can do is wipe random flakes of foam from its lips." Veidt, in turn quit crime fighting because crime is "a symptom of the overall sickness of the human spirit. I don't believe you can cure a disease by suppressing its symptoms." Moore's sharp writing and ability to create atmosphere are at best as strong personalities filled with underlining clash. In one scene Veidt, the world's strongest Maslow-believer is turned against Dr. Manhattan, "the walking H-bomb." "I've walked across the sun. I've seen events so small they can barely se said to have occurred at all but you are a man and the world's smartest man means nothing more to me than the world's smartest termite," Manhattan sneers. It is confrontations like this that make this one of Moore's many masterpieces. The book features personalities and circumstance as colorful as the names and costumes of its characters.

BattleStar Galactica, Season 3, continues where the last season left off.  Overall, I've found this season somewhat uneven, with several episodes being simply incredible, while others have been more or less flat.  In spite of this, if you loved Seasons 1 and 2, then 3 is well worth the price.  At the very least, go out and rent it just so that you can see the humans escape from New Caprica.  Probably one of the most amazing episodes in the history of television.

The movie's subject matter, first and foremost is very HEAVY.  

The story follows a boy in a particular German military family.  He is your average adventurous and innocent/ na飗e eight-year-old boy.  His family is a very ordinary German family, for that time, except his father had just been promoted to a high position within the military, causing the family, much to the children's chagrin, to move out to the country (discovered in the first five minutes of the film).  

In this movie, you will see a wide range of acceptance and emotion for the German political agenda.  You'll see the happenings of this family from the boy's perspective, including his introduction to the Jewish people. 

In my opinion, this movie is very well made, intelligent, and powerful.  The messages that are being conveyed are wonderful conversation pieces.  It's time to expand horizons and stimulate the brain with this very strong film.  Grab some family or friends, or someone from the office and see what this movie is all about.

I over-analyzed this purchase but ended up very happy with this grinder.  It's my first one after getting into using a French press and the fresh grind makes the coffee experience all the better. It's quiet and easy to use as per previous comments. I can attest to the coarse grind being suitable for French press but can't comment on the use for espresso. I am sure the comments from other reviewers are true.

The only thing worth mentioning is the comment from another person who said to be careful when unpacking everything.  Look for the label that says "push" when you are removing the plastic components. Sounds stupid, I know, but the package design is 'clever'.

This mini-prep-processor is the second Cuisinart product I have bought from Amazon. The first was a refurbished convection toaster oven. The careful engineering and attractive, simple design of both products impress me. Also impressive is how wonderfully well they work!

After reading a lot of the Amazon reviews-- not all 350+-- I was convinced this mini-chopper-processor would be a better replacement for the small, inexpensive Black and Decker that burned out with no warning after one year of very mild use. Avoid Black & Decker in the kitchen is my conclusion. Anyway...
this Little Honey, that's what I call him, arrived the day before Thanksgiving. Before that I'd only used the B/D to pulverize cat food twice a day. The cats spit out meat or fish pieces they'd have to chew. Waste of money, so they get instant grind instead.
What good timing! I put that Little Honey right to work. The slightly larger cup capacity, two speeds, a strong sounding motor of the Cuisinart, and its crisp good looks kept inviting me to whip up quick dips, sauces and icings for unexpected company-- as well as, the morning and evening cat food.
The compact size lets me keep it up on the counter. I get more use out of it than my large food processor down in the cupboards somewhere. If it were a little larger I would replace the big processor.

Why only 4 stars?
I think it is a great little tool, but I am waiting to see how long before the motor burns out. And 4 stars because it does not chop evenly, when I chop such chunky things as celery or certain mixtures of wet cat food large pieces are left. 
(No, not together! I wash it out well between food types.) 

Usually I run it until I smell the motor burning then stop. That is after the recommended 10 to 12 seconds, alternating between Lo and Hi speeds. Some other reviewer mentioned the burning smell also, so I assume it is normal...
Anyway, if it is still doing this before the warranty runs I will have to send the Little Honey back. For now, I love it very much.

I already had a "good" and reasonably portable camcorder, but found I didn't use it much because of the hassle of carrying it around (even though it could, with some bulging, fit in my pocket). I thought it would be great to have a camcorder I could actually USE with little preparation or bother. Now,I use the zi6 much more often and with little need to plan.

My PCs all run WinXP, and my initial impressions of the zi6 output were quite poor, because the playback (even after copying the MOV files from the SD card to the HD) looks very jerky, even on a reasonably powerful PC. However, I was pleased to find that once you convert the MOV files to a more Win-friendly format, the playback is really very good -- not like from an expensive camcorder, but certainly better than my old "home movies" or VHS-based recordings. So, for Windows users, the immediate/instant playback of the MOV files should be seen as just a first draft -- it will look much better if you care enough about your video to convert it.

The software shipped with the camera is crap -- a total waste. Good choices include: DVDFlick (Free!) to go directly from a series of the zi6's MOV files, to creating a DVD (with simple menus); or, if you want to do editing or enhancing, you might invest a hundred bucks in Adobe Premiere Elements. Forget using Windows Movie Maker, which will not accept MOV files due to Mr. Bill's pathological hostility to anything Mac-based, including MOV files, a/k/a QuickTime Movies. ("Thanks," Mr. Bill.)

Another tip: Use the default HD format, even if your TV and computer monitor display in the older 4:3 ratio. You can switch the zi6 recording to VGA, which is 4:3 (although you have to do this EVERY time you start the camera), which I did at first, but the HD mode has significantly more pixels, even with the bands of black across the top and bottom, and I found it really does look much better. I can learn to ignore the black bands, until I eventually move to a 16:9, HDTV.

Two more drawbacks: You cannot turn-off the musical chimes at startup, which seems like a small thing until you want to start-and-stop recording during, say, a school play or in some other situation where your little beeps will disturb others (and their own recordings). And, there is effectively no zoom (just digital zoom, which here is both minor and counter-productive).

But if you don't care about zooming-in for closeups, and if Windows users don't mind some post-processing before seeing the output actually look good, and if your camcorder criteria place a high value on portability and convenience, this is an excellent choice. 

I now think nothing of slipping this less-than-wallet-sized beauty into my pocket, going someplace and capturing some potentially good moments. And if the results are keepers, I can spend a little time making them more Windows-viewable. 

The zi6 fills a need, and fills it better than comparable products, in my opinion. My only misgiving is the technical issue, for Windows users, of dealing with these MOV files.

I have been a fan of the Superman films for a very long time and have enjoyed them very much. SMALLVILLE is part of that and have followed the series since ep.1 season one. Could not purchase this in Australia so

I enjoy the story lines very much and I like to see how baby Clark has turned into the great person he has, I hope in the next season we see him learn   to fly and how this happens. I feel series 8 will be the last as it is getting close to where SUPERMAN takes over.

This movie epitomizes everything that movies should be. It entertains, it teaches life lessons, it makes us laugh out loud and it leaves us wanting more. The story is familiar. Good versus evil, evil appears to be dominant  and finally succumbs to the relentlessness of the hero. The love interest  is palpable and the struggles are monumental. The audience is always  involved. We root for the good guys and wince with their every setback.  There is no profanity and the story is delightful for all the family. I  recommend this movie for anyone who wants to feel better about life!

After a succession of failed $50 toasters (Cuisinart, Black & Decker, Hamilton Beach, etc.) it is finally satisfying to own a toaster that works.  Once you get past the $100 sticker-shock, you'll realize that cheaper toasters that poop-out after only a few months of use are no bargain.  This KitchenAid toaster is solidly built, works great and is worth the money.

I've been using the 30-Day Shred (as part of my larger overall workout routine) for a few months. I absolutely LOVE it and LOVE Jillian, so I was excited to hear about the new DVDs. I ordered this one, as well as 'No More Trouble Zones.' I should have them in a day or two. I found 'Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism' on Exercise TV last night and tried it. Wow! A GREAT workout! I love Jillian's 'Personal Trainer' style. I much prefer her style of workout over the more 'dancy' stuff that's out there.

I did a lot of research before purchasing this drive. I needed something that worked well to backup, movies, music, photos, and to use as a Time Machine backup for Mac OS X. I read a lot of reviews about bad firmware and other problems, but for me, I plugged it in and it's worked great thus far. I hope I'm not jinxing myself, but it's been great and it's a 1TB of space! I'm using it with a MacBook Pro 2.16GHz and 10.5.3 -- only good things to say!

I have this new 120gb ipod and its great. I certainly wont run out of storage anytime soon, and by the time I do, hopefully they will have found a way to add better capacity to the iphone/touch. I considered the iphone because of all the bells and whistles but I just cant justify the expense with it having such a piddly capacity. Seriously Apple, why try to make a do-it-all device that cant actually hold it all? So for now, I use this for my music/video/photos and I couldnt be happier with it. The sound and picture quality is way better than my old one and I love the charcoal color of it. I havent had an issues at all with it.

This USB hub works just like it suppose to and I have had no problems with it. There is plenty of space between connection jacks so you have no problem taking USB plugs in and out. When I read about the blue light from other reviewers I knew I wanted as it would light up my computer room so I wouldn't have to leave a light on when I went out. It is not overly bright but it does enable me to walk around without bumping into the furniture. You probably wouldn't want it in your bedroom at night if you like it really dark. It is just a fun kind of thing for an ordinary electrical device.

It does work a bit. But it doesn't cover that much territory and my cat finds new places to poop throughout the house.

Recommend the Forever Litter Tray 100%!  
Completely worth the cost!   Repeat customer bought the first version of this tray & liked it. 
Now have this newest Forever Tray & it is AWESOME!  
It does NOT leak at all, thanks to the one piece construction. 
It has a few little extras that make it perfect.  Like the great material it is made of & 2 lid clips & a ridge to keep the solids in their compartment.

This tray certainly saves money.  The cost & waste of disposable trays is just not reasonable.  The original tray lasted a long time & I'm sure this one will last for much longer, many years. 
 
This is quick & easy to clean.
I keep disposable vinyl gloves, Lysol cleaner, paper towels, garbage bags & new Scoop Free Crystals litter in the cabinet nearby - they actually take up less room than a stack of disposable trays.  Sooo much less expensive!
The Forever Litter Tray is quick & easy to clean - I think it only takes 2 minutes more than the disposable.

Also, the company is great to work with - real old fashion service from Rick & his crew!

One side note - I have tried all the litter brands - Scoop Free is the only one to buy.  Tidy Cat is ok - but don't waste a dime on the cheaper brands - they do not control odor & wetness well.

Bottom line - Forever Tray saves money & is easy to use.

I didn't have a good history with PC gamepads until I bought the Logitech Precision 2.  I tried several different models, only to find that each of them dragged in a specific direction, the buttons didn't function properly, or they didn't work at all.  With the Precision 2, I experienced none of this.

I'm not much for the high-end PC games, so I can't speak much for its effectiveness on that front.  However, for emulators and other classic games, this is the best choice out there.  I'm pleased to report that the name "Precision" was not a broken promise.  The pad even performs effectively on fighting games, where you have to input ridiculously long combinations of motions in order to perform the best moves.

Great pad for a great price.  I liked mine so much that I bought a second one for my fiancee.  You won't go wrong here!

This review is from: Howard the Duck (VHS Tape)

      



I was actually 2 years old when this movie came out, but somehow I was smart enough by the age of 3 to record it on VHS. Yes, I taped it off of HBO when I was a little girl and I watched it over and over and over and over. By the time I was 11, I forgot all about the movie (had moved onto Dumb & Dumber repeatedly), until my mother brought up my past obsession with this movie. It's just one of those bad 80's classics that will make you laugh hard and maybe have a tear at the end because it's such a happy ending. Life isn't full of those, and life isn't full of happy ending movies anymore either, so why not sit back, relax, and enjoy this show. For old times sake.

I love this mini PC!  I got it because my laptop is a Compaq with a large screen, and it is really too heavy to lug around, especially when traveling.  I can read e-mail.  It has a power point viewer, and Microsoft works.  There are some games already loaded.  

I had some problems connecting to my wireless network at home.  I contacted ASUS tech support, but what they suggested did not work.  I took it to the Geek Squad, and they straightened that out. It works great!  

I am glad I waited until the 8.9" screen came out to buy it, but I wish that it had been available in black.  I had the 7 inch black one on my wish list. It comes with a case made of material, sort of like foam padding.  I wish that it came with a case that would also store the charger.

I read all the reviews, researched all the competitors and decided on the Acer Aspire One. The Acer Aspire One is a complete notebook computer in a small package. The computing power, hard drive capacity and features allow me to run any Windows application I need. I teach computer science and do software development and it is great to have s super portable computer with so much power. I was going to purchase the Asus eePC until I had an opportunity to try an actual computer and discovered I did not like the keyboard layout on the Asus. When I got a change to try an Acer I was sold. I can touch type on my Acer with no problems. The keyboard is a little smaller than normal but the key layout is perfect.

There is a variable speed fan so if you are looking for a totaly noise free computer this is not it but the fan is no different than any of my other laptops. The mouse buttons are located on the side of the mouse pad which takes a little getting used to.

Batter life is very good with ~5 hours of operation doing normal tasks while connected with wifi. The wifi connects reliably and with no problems and has very good range. The screen is very easy to read. I have had my Aspire One for about a month now and I am very pleased with it.

This review is from: Transporter 3 (Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)

      



Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is back and this time he is forced to transport Valentina (Natalya Rudakova), an objectionable young woman, across Europe by a group of villains who have fitted Frank and Valentina with explosive bracelets. If either of them move more than 75 feet away from Frank's car, their bracelet will explode.

Given all of the other reviews that I have read of "The Transporter 3", I went in to this film expecting to be disappointed and was pleasantly surprised when I wasn't. Although the script is not quite as good as Luc Besson's previous film, "Taken", this is more than made up for by the awesome stunts and martial arts sequences (choreographed by Cory Yuen, who was responsible for the action sequences in the previous two films). Two action sequences in particular, one involving Statham effectively performing a striptease while fighting half a dozen villains, and the grand finale on the train, are alone worth the price of admission.

One of the main criticisms that had been leveled at this film is that the heroine is distractingly ugly and annoying. Although Rudakova and Statham seem to have absolutely no chemistry between them at all and I did wonder why Frank Martin was even remotely interested in Valentina, she wasn't so annoying as to ruin the film for me. Valentina is meant to be objectionable, and keeping that in mind, I actually thought Rudakova did a good job of playing her. As for her looks, I didn't think she was bad looking, just different, and I actually thought it was nice to see someone who didn't look the same as every other Hollywood heroine.

As for Jason Statham, I am still not certain as to whether he can act or not, but who really cares. Statham became famous because of his personality and his martial arts skills and both are again on display. Sure this film is somewhat derivative of Statham's other film, in particular "Crank", but that didn't bother me, and it shouldn't bother other Statham fans either.

So far this camera is everything I expected it to be and more. It is very easy to operate and the picture is very good. The 60 gb provides plenty of space even at High Quality picture mode. I recommend that a larger capacity battery be purchase. Some expert reviewers have said that this camera does not have image stabilization and that is just not the case. Image stabilization works very well on this camera. The main thing I like about this camera is that I no longer need to use tapes. The software for uploading to the PC works very well. For the money, this is a very good product.

I have tried many whey proteins in my lifetime, and ON is the brand I've settled on, not only for cost, but the lactase allows even the lactose intolerant to drink it with milk, and the "instantized" feature allows it to mix without any granules to choke down!  However, if you have not tried any flavors, the chocolate mint falls second to the rocky road which is the best tasting pure whey protein around.

I like this trimmer.  The turbo vacuum catches most of the hair, though not all, especially when switching from the accessory heads.  I can now trim my beard at the sink with a fraction of the cleanup that was required with my old trimmer that didn't have a vacuum.  I really like the "specialty Mini-Beard trimmer attachment" which allows me to easily shape my beard and moustache while still using the vacuum.  That was one of my hesitations before purchasing the trimmer, but it has exceeded my expectations.  Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase and the value I've recieved for the money spent.

I don't know what the other reviewer did, but this thing works great, right out of the box! It was a no brainer. I traded in a Lynksys modem and Netgear WiFi router. THAT combo wouldn't let me videocam. This Motorola does!

But this Motorola was a much cheaper option, works with Comcast and supports webcams with no additional setup. I'm so glad I got it and HIGHLY recommend it. It's cheaper and takes up less space if you need to purchase both a modem and WiFi router. It was SO easy.

This five disc package includes (1) the three hour miniseries and (2) the first 13 episodes of Battlestar Galactica.  The miniseries is the quality of a good movie and the episodes which follow are top notch. BG is a well-crafted, adult, serious Scifi series that eschews the hokey and the exotic for down-to-earth tales of human relationships in outer space. (Is that a mixed metaphor or what?)      

The miniseries tells us of the attack by the man-made cylons on the 12 inhabited worlds of the universe, the utter defeat of man, and the flight of the last remaining 50,000 humans in a rag-tag fleet led by an ancient warship, the Battleship Galactica. Olmos is the captain of the BG; McDonnell is the insignificant politician who becomes the President -- thus the conflict between military and civilian becomes one of the continuing themes. 

In season one, the Battlestar Galactica searches for planet earth, the legendary thirteenth home of the human race while attempting to avoid the cylons. A premium in this series is placed on acting talent and interpersonal relationships. Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell are superb, seasoned actors and they carry off the lead roles perfectly. The younger actors are equally good; there's not a false note anywhere. "Number Six" (Tricia Helfer) adds a generous helping of sex appeal and glamour that is lacking in many Scifi movies. Every character is well-defined.  The sets are good; the action scenes are realistic; the tension is high; and the cliff-hanger endings are often spectacular.   

Perhaps my enthusiasm is too much -- but BG is my all-time favorite Scifi series. It's a survival story I find credible, touching, and sad.You don't have to be a scifi or action flick fan to like BG -- although there's plenty of both. 

Now, it's on to see season two of the series. I can hardly wait.

This movie is by far the best movie I have ever seen. Not just the best Batman movie ever, but the best movie ever. I have been a Batman fan since I was old enough to read and I read my first Batman comic. I have been a major comic book geek since and have made it my goal to know everything there is to know about Batman. As a huge fan I was happy to see that this movie stayed as close to the comics as a movie can. The story was great and the action even better. There are a few discrepancies between how Two Face was born between comic mythos and the movie but it still was a great story. The casting is perfect and Christopher Nolan is the best director the Batman franchise has had. 
I am not a fan of Heath Ledger but in this movie he out did himself. He was the perfect Joker and It is heart breaking to see him pass. The joker is supposed to be dark and homicidal. Heath Ledger made the Joker I have grown up fearing in comics come to life on the big screen. 

Now the Blu-Ray release, this is a must have. The picture and sound quality on the right tv is 100 times better than the theater experience. The sound is incredible and makes you feel like you are in the middle of the action. The Blu-Ray also has special features not found on the DVD version. One of which is the hour long special from the history channel called Batman Tech. It is how Batman's gadgets could really be made with today's tech. It is well worth it to get this movie because of the great Blu-Ray features, and because the movie is worth it a million times over. I recommend this to anyone who loves a great action film. You don't have to be a comic book fan or a Batman fan to enjoy this movie.

  After giving up on all Linksys products for dead out the box and intermittent signal, in addition to their setup CD's being useless, what a relief to find a product that works fantastic and is a breeze to setup.
  I am using XP SP2 and download and installed the lastest firmware from Dlink. Dlink's website is great. They have detailed instructions with text and pictures. I set the router up manually because of my experience with Linksys and was up and running in 15 minutes.
  This router is fast and I have yet to drop signal from anyware in my 2 story house. I purchased the Xtreme N Wireless PCI Express card DWA-652 for the laptop and am running in wireless -n- only.
  It's like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders. Doing work from home has never been free of frustration because of signal drops until this router.
  Tell your friends and family to purchse this router and card combination and end drop signals for all wireless users.

Let's put the highest praise first: I just bought my second TEW-432BRP (first is at home; second is for work/office). Why?

1. Major selling point for me: Configuration is very easy. As a linux user, hardware often becomes a trouble point. Although the manual accompanying the unit suggests you need to run a Windows package off of a CD to set up the router, the entire configuration can be done via the web. It's hard to imagine things getting much easier... To top it off, the configuration is pretty comprehensive, allowing you to configure the device from a number of different angles (WEP/WPA support, filters, firewalling, ...)

2. Second major selling point: I'm cheap -- the price is definitely on the reasonable side

Other notes:

- The range is just fine if the building is "wireless-friendly". I have no problem connecting from one end of our 4-bedroom home (2000+ sq ft) where the router is situated at the other end of the home. On the other hand, the router I bought for work is problematic. When the router is on the first floor of the building and I am on the lower floor but otherwise nearby, the connection quality is very poor. This may be related to the construction of the building - lots of metal in the walls with cinderblock structure for the weight-bearing walls.

- having 4 LAN ports is nice if you want to plug in an internet printer or other internet devices

- my first router has lasted many months w/continuous use - reliability doesn't seem to be an issue - we'll see how the second one does

I purchased this after my Emjoi OptiMini Epilator died after only about a year. I found on Amazon that this is a common occurrence.

Previously I would have to inch up to a specific part of the mirror in my bathroom to see what I was doing. Now I can epilate almost anywhere. I use it on my chin as well as the traditional areas. It is too big to use on you eyebrows. Yea! I am free.

Following the Braun company recommendation, at the 18th month mark, I changed out the screen and blade block. The Gillette blade block was an "upgrade", I can really notice the difference. Further, this was the lowest price for this product that I found.

I have been looking for this set here in my hometown and I could not find it anywhere. I was trying to stay away from buying season to season because it would have been to costly. A friend recommended looking for it on Amazon and BANG!!! there it was. I placed my order quickly and it was here just in time for me to watch it for Christmas. Consider it a Christmas present from myself. I guess it was OK to be greedy this year and shop for myself, but it was money well spent. I have been watching these DVDs everyday after work and I still haven't gotten tired of them. These are a must have if you are a true TZ fan!!!

i purchased this product about 3 months ago and each time i use it, i like it more and more.At first though i thought it was awkward to use. But now i forget how good it is. 
the more you use it the more the detents become weaker and weaker. But you dont really need them.
this system is very easy to program (once you figure it out).i would highly recommend looking at the manual that comes on the disk that comes with it.
The only problem with it is that you never need to take your hands off of it!!:) You have a little mouse thing on the throttle control and 19+ buttons! it can be confusing to which does what but you learn.
The minor issue is that the joystick is weak leaving your hand tired. But i just wrapped and taped some kleenix on it then it works great. But eventually it can leave your right arm tired, but then i just raise the office chair and then the problem is solved
if your thinking of buying this for any reason then go for it. it is highly worth the money. This is more for a fighter game but it also works great with FSX!

This product arrived promptly. After I opened the box, I was up and running in less than 5 minutes. I immediately was notified that a newer version of firmware was available, and downloaded it. Clicked on it and it was installed in a few minutes. I installed 2 brand new drives in a few seconds - just popped them in. The format took a while since they were 500G.

Then bingo! - Off and flying with a mirror raid set and I haven't looked back since. Performance in my application as a file and media server is better than I expected. Lots of support by users as well. Haven't attached the printer yet, so that is unknown.

Very Pleased.

Product was as advertised. I think it needs to state what size pets it will work best with. It works but if the nails(claws)have alot of growth it's going to take awhile to trim them down,two or three settings because even though it is better than clippers, long sections tend to heat up the nails to an uncomfortable level.

Because of an upcoming move with weight limits, I couldn't justify purchasing my long-dreamed of stand mixer, so the KitchenAid hand-held seemed an excellent compromise.

It's very lightweight, very powerful (almost lost control of it when using it for the first time).  I did not find any difficulty in using it for long beating.  It is a bit difficult to control the beater and scrape the side of the bowl with a spatula at the same time because of its power, but I'm sure such control will come with time and familiarity with the beater.

I highly recommend this mixer to anyone looking for a good handmixer from a quality company.

I have two small Shih Tzus who were badly stained. The older one needed surgery several years ago, so since she'd be "under" anyways, I had the vet do a tear-duct flush on her, it worked well, and she looked good for 2 or 3 years, but in time the stains and smell returned. Then, when our new Shih Tzu needed to be spayed I paid the extra to have them do the tear duct flush on her while she was asleep. It did nothing. She had a second surgery about 6 months ago for a foxtail removal, so I paid the extra, again, to give it another shot amd....nothing! After reading the reviews for this product I decided to give it a whirl, and I am amazed by the results! My babies are both darling now! And their faces seem to smell better as well. I do suggest that you find the best priced 240 gram bottle (you'll actually save a lot of money). I learned the hard way by repeatedly buying an expensive small bottle of it and quickly running out. 
Mix it with a little wet food and feed everyday without skipping. After a few weeks, you only need to use it 2 or 3 times a week.

I bought this pedometer based on an enthusiatic review on Amazon.com.  For me, wearing a pedometer on my belt has always been an annoyance.  The review of this pedometer said you can put it in your pocket or elsewhere.  I got the pedometer, put it in my pants pocket, and also put a pedometer on my belt that was known for its step-count accuracy, then set off on walk of 625 steps.  The belt pedometer read 525, but the new Omron read 624.  This pedometer also zeros itself out overnight, so I just put it in my pants pocket in the morning and check it before I go to bed.  I've rarely seen a product act as advertised, but this one certainly has.  Three weeks into it, it's performing like a champ!

This review is from: The Wizard of Oz (DVD)

      



FIRST (directed to the Educated): "The Wizard of Oz" is a timeless classic that belongs in everyone's DVD collection. In October 2005 there will be both a 2 and 3 DVD Special Edition, boasting enhanced video and audio, along with many extras. I hope the new edition will also correct some of the technical flaws contained in the bonus features of the currently available DVD; the Margaret Hamilton interview, for example, had a glitch. It would be pointless for me to add another review of this film gem that everyone on the planet knows so well. Still want to read a review? There are over 390 to choose from. Read on.

SECOND (directed to the Uneducated): For the last time, Widescreen (CinemaScope) and Stereophonic Sound were technologies unavailable, thus not used, in films until the early 1950's. In 1953 "The Robe" became the first CinemaScope (Widescreen) film made. It also contained Stereophonic Sound, although I am not certain if it was the first film that was produced in Stereophonic Sound. But this I can tell you, "The Wizard of Oz" (released in 1939) and all other films that were produced prior to 1953 were NOT filmed in Widescreen or Stereophonic Sound. Okay? Got that? Hopefully, this information will put to rest the endless remarks criticizing the DVD producers for not releasing "The Wizard of Oz" and other pre-1953 films in Widescreen and/or Stereophonic Sound, formats that were non-existent at the time that these films were made. To really blow your minds: After 1953 there were certain films that were made in Widescreen but not in color, and other films that were made in color but not in Widescreen. Do some research folks, because we are all sick and tired of the subject. Case in point: You can expect "Beauty and the Beast" to be available in Widescreen and Stereophonic Sound, but don't expect the same of "Pinocchio". Happy viewing, and enjoy the new edition of "The Wizard of Oz" coming in October 2005.

This is our first food processor and I have enjoyed the novelty of it.  I have found slicing a whole cucumber in 0.3 seconds is really what its all about.  I tried to make shredded pork,  but used the wrong attachment and ended up making BBQ pork paste, I still ate it...still learning.

I did a fair amount of research before selecting this one about a month ago.  I have not been disappointed.  It is extremely convenient and powerful.  The video that comes with it, is very useful.  You have to pause it a few times to keep up.  I don't have a Kitchen Aid to compare it to, but I have no complaints about this one.

Needless to say, the two previous books in the series were just what young adults need today. And now that it has progressed, and nearing the end, I can fully appreciate Meyer's talent. Especially in the third novel, the characters emotions and actions evolve and become all the more realistic. More than ever before I can relate to the characters and feel closer to the story, especially the relationship between Bella and Jacob - I believe Meyer was dead on when exploring that side of Bella and Jacob and what they had in the second novel. It's as if these people could really exist and be apart of such a love affair that has losses on both sides. Truly a great piece of work - can't wait for the final act.

Our neighbor gave us this toy for Christmas and our younger feline has been entertained almost non-stop ever since. 

We have and have had several other felines, canines and equines, (previously also have had tarantulas, turtles, parakeets, zebra finches, pigeons, chickens, pheasants, rabbits, lizards, ant farms, etc., not to mention human younglings, also one particular precocious horned toad named Bob), and in our expeience, the only two real questions for a pet toy are: Does it truly entertain? AND does it hold up to the entertainment? 

This toy is awesome on both counts. Our two cats play it like tetherball or racquetball, but mostly the younger one entertains himself, even dragging some of his more mobile toys onto it (hoping they will somehow learn from it?) Then, having tired himself out he drapes himself across it in sleep... Only to start this series of events all over again at 2:00 a.m. (Hint: At night put it where he/she can't reach it if you want an uninterrrupted night's sleep.) 

He can't strip it of any feathers or fuzzies, or bat it semi-permanently under the fridge. He can't run out the batteries and doesn't tire of its full potential gamut, as it just gets more challenging to him the more he learns. 

And it's just as entertaining for us to watch the play!
 
Plus it's a great deal. The best cat toy we've ever seen/ bought/ imagined/ been given so far in a combined some 70 years of experience with cat friendship. Buy it... if you're a cat person AT ALL (and who isn't?... don't answer that!) then you won't regret it! EVER! Mike & Michele

I bought this after seeing the black version available.  It is great that Asus did not bump up the premium price for the black (Apple I hope you are listening).  I am very happy with this purchase.  I avoided the pearl white because I was afraid of getting it scuffed up being white and all.  

This is a very user friendly laptop (Targeted after all for your children and older adults).  I was never a huge Linux fan but the version that they installed here is at par with xp, even surpasses it because of the tabbed interface that is similar to Firefox.  You do not even need to read the manual or be an expert on Linux to figure the thing out.  It is a great starter laptop, and at the same time a great secondary laptop for the road warrior or student.

The EEE PC features are ultra mobile, sleek, and loaded with useful programs.  I was going to switch the OS to XP but after playing around with the Linux OS, I was impressed with the features it has.  I bought this mainly as a portable internet device and for a bit of word processing.  I also note that the unit is very light, about 2 lbs. 3 oz and the boot time is exceedingly fast since it has a solid state drive.  I actually rated this 4 1/2 stars.  The gripes I have are expected, the keyboard is cramped and takes a bit of getting used to and you have to have an external dvd/cd drive to update to xp.  The monitor though at a lower 800 x 600 resolution, is surprisingly bright and crisp.  So far the storage is at 4 gig, so you have about 1.5 gig left over.  This can be solved by adding a high capacity SD card, right now I believe they have up to 16 gig capacity for sale (I installed 4 gig).  Love the fact that wireless G is built in.  I haven't used the webcam yet but so far I am very impressed with the total package.  


Highly recommended to adults and kids.  Great little laptop for all ages.  Truly a complete and very Excellent, Exciting, and Extraordinary PC!  

Update:  Wireless connectivity works great.  I was able to use it with great ease at Sky Harbor Airport at Arizona, battery life last about 2 1/2 hours (running media files a lot though) but the small A/C plug comes in handy, it weighs 6 oz.  So total carry weight with the unit is 2 lbs. 9 oz.  Was able to use web cam, it does a decent job, I don't plan to use it as much so it is not an issue for me.  I love the fact that many people commented on how small the laptop is.

Warranty update: You can now upgrade the ram to 1 gig or 2 gig without voiding the warranty.  Visit the Asus EEE pc site for more info.

I've had a regular Norelco beard trimmer for years and when the battery would no longer hold a charge I decided to give this one a try.  I didn't really follow the vacuum or turbo descriptions but bought it anyway based on price.  Boy am I glad I did!  The vacuum makes trimming so much less of a mess.  I use it also to buzz cut my hair and there is virtually no mess now where there used to be stubbles of hair everywhere before.  I do have to empty the vacuum container a few times but less mess is far better.  Great product.  The description really doesn't do it justice.  It really works!

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)

      



I've been struggling with this one for a while, because quite frankly I wasn't sure how I wanted to go about writing it.  I think it's hard with a film like `The Dark Knight' because if you don't review it carefully then it may come across like just another superhero movie, and with `The Dark Knight', the film that has been hailed as the best superhero movie of all time you have to be able to relay that to the reader, prove to them that this is more than just an action film; that there is real stock in the claims that this is the `Godfather' of all superhero films.

True, not everyone will feel the same way, but I feel an obligation to explain to you why I feel the way that I do.

First I want to implore you, if you have not already, to watch `Batman Begins' before watching `The Dark Knight'.  The two are truly companion pieces and you will not be able to appreciate the full progression of character (especially within Bruce Wayne) that Nolan and Bale have created unless you first witness how it all began.  Sure, it is not necessary to see the first film in order to enjoy this film for the action/genre film that it is, but it helps you to see just how this film transcends the boundaries of its genre if you see it from the very beginning.

What sets `The Dark Knight' apart from every other superhero film, and really any other genre film, is that if you strip away the costumes you still have a film.  This is not a movie about a superhero; this is a movie that contains a superhero.  This is a movie about the realities of destiny, our choices, our weaknesses, our loyalties and our failures.  It broaches those very human and very controversial subjects with an intelligence that is not often seen in a film of this nature.  I think that sadly too many critics of this film look at it as a superhero movie, and so they immediately shrug it off as nothing more, but if they were to search deeper into the root of this film they would see that this is far more than just another Hollywood Blockbuster.

The film follows Bruce Wayne as he struggles to find a balance between his personal life (which he feels is leaving him) and his life as Batman, which is becoming more and more necessary as Gotham City becomes the target of a madman known as The Joker.  While the film follows a carefully crafted storyline of doublecrossment with The Joker offering Gotham's mob bosses a chance to keep their money and rid themselves of the Batman, the real story is all wrapped up in the conflicting sides of good and evil that manifest themselves in the characters that appear on the screen.  Everyone from Wayne to Joker to Gotham's new district attorney Harvey Dent are susceptible to this emotional corruption, and they all have different ways of dealing with that particular crisis.  The Joker introduces a new kind of madness to Gotham, a madness that knows no boundaries, and this proposes a question of ethics and morals within those who have to deal with this monster.

The fact remains that the emotional punches this film throws your way are not those of your typical superhero movie; for they are far too real.

The masterful performances by the cast only help elevate this film, added more layers of realism to the madness.  Bale reprises his role as Wayne and he does so with powerful conviction, especially as the film draws to a close and his own moral stance is jeopardized by his emotions.  I still haven't gotten used to the Batman voice, but his Wayne is by far the best Wayne ever displayed on screen; for he infuses Bruce with a humanity that has not been seen before.  Gary Oldman also returns as police lieutenant Gordon and this time raises the bar by inserting raw despair as the city falls to pieces around him.  Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman also reprise their roles for this sequel and continue to astound, delivering significant aid to Wayne's personal transformation.  Newcomers include Maggie Gyllenhaal (who replaced Katie Holmes), Aaron Eckhart and Heath Ledger.  Gyllenhaal is a force here, never slinking into the background as did Holmes but making the character of Rachel front and center, providing the film the moral counterbalance to The Joker's influence.  Eckhart is magnificent as Dent, downplaying his own charms to give his character a sense of insecurity that only comes with the job.  Matched against Bale he is the perfect compliment to Wayne's insecurities masked over by an abundance of faux charm.  

But we all know that this movie is all about the late, great, Heath Ledger.  Ledger's portrayal of The Joker is a far cry from Nicholson's (we all know how I feel about that one).  Instead of portraying the fiend as a joke, Ledger sunk down into the darkness that corroded this mans sanity, and the result was an iconic look at the evils that exist in us all.  The Joker is an exaggerated look at the conflict wrestling in our own subconscious; the battle between good and bad that we all must struggle to win over.  Ledger manages to capture that without ever making it a mockery.

I will not be one to say that this film has no weaknesses.  I feel that the film is a tad too long, I will give you that; and I was a little upset over the way the Two-Face character was give such little true treatment.  It could have easily worked itself into the third film, for the squeezing in of the character at the last minute seemed a tad rushed.

That's it though.  I have no other complaints.

The fact remains that `The Dark Knight' is a masterpiece.  It is a film that transcends the boundaries of genre and proves that you don't have to be a typical Oscar bait film to deliver a message.  Think back over the years of Oscar to the last time a superhero movie has garnered this much buzz and attention.  

I'm waiting.  

Nothing?  

Didn't think so.  

You see, `The Dark Knight' is unlike any other genre film out there.  Nolan and company have taken all that you think you know and turned it on its head.  The message within `The Dark Knight' is a bleak one, but it is given a glimmer of hope that we all do well to contemplate.  Yes, the world is a dark and dangerous place, but we have the opportunity to make the right choices regardless of how we are being conditioned.  We can stand up for what is right and fight the darkness that encircles us.  We can all be a superhero of sorts, for we all have the power of free choice.

Even the third of a series did not disappoint but left me craving more.  Stephenie is a winner with these books.  I can't wait for the next one and I couldn't put the book down.  I appreciate her ability to create a love story without having to include teenagers having sex.  A hero who desires to wait for marriage is a woman's dream and in a day of dangerous free sex, this is refreshing, showing young women that it is romantic, as well as safer, to wait.  You and your daughter can enjoy this book, and both of you will be equally drawn in.

Good Pedometer, reasonable price.  It is very accurate, I have tested it against several known standards and it is very close.  It stays attached easily and when it does come loose it just slips out of the carrier and the stop strap keeps it from falling and breaking.  Only criticism I have is that the stop strap which is white nylon fabric gets dirty.  Maybe some other material or color would be better.  But it works great, is accurate, inexpensive and very durable.  Can't really ask for more.

I had read all the reviews before buying the product and they were largely favorable.  I can certainly add my voice to that group.  The Xacti comes out of the box and into service right after charging the battery.  It was easy to use and takes outstanding still pictures as well as very high quality video.  I have never been a video buff but I felt that I wanted to try to get more into it when considering all of the great tools now available for manipulation of video.  I now find myself remembering to bring the Xacti and having video memories available.

I had read some people thinking the battery life could be a problem.  I have not experienced that and I wonder whether the concerns might not stem from the difference between the sleep setting and the off setting.  The Xacti can be be turned off with a long push of the on/off button but it can also be suspended with a short duration push of the on/off button.  It seems at least plausible that some people think it is off when it is not actually.  Certainly just a theory.

I don't really understand the terrible ratings here...yeah it was a short season, yeah it was a tad convoluted at times.  But it still has the quality production and eye popping visuals we are accustomed to in Heroes.  I fully recommend this product and can't wait for season 3 to start!

This is a very good ice-cream maker. There's really not that much to say about it except that it makes delicious ice-cream! Especially when used with Ben and Jerry's Ice-Cream cookbook.Oh, I like the design where the canister -and not the paddle- spins, it seems sturdier. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that it could be a little quieter. But I'm just being difficult. Go ahead and buy it -you won't be disappointed.

Compared to the Drinkwell fountain I had previously - it's a much better fountain for a number of reasons.  

Good things:
- Quiet.  When it's running properly, you can't hear a thing.
- Doesn't make the water too warm.  This is important because with the Drinkwell fountain, the motor would get hot and warm the water - not only do the cats dislike this, but it leads to an increased chance of bacteria formation.  I honestly don't know how it keeps the water cool, but it does.
- Filters are cheap.  You can get 2 or 3 packs at Petsmart for cheap, or get them from Ebay for even less.
- Material is easy to clean.  The entire unit is made of a very smooth plastic that makes it very easy to clean.  The Drinkwell fountain was made of a rough material that "trapped" food particles and made it difficult to clean.  

As much as I like it, there are some things that definitely need to be improved:

Bad things:
- The motor traps hair easily.  Hair gets caught in the motor and you have to remove the hair almost weekly.  If not, you'll find the fountain doesn't work properly and you have to keep turning it on and off.
- There's a plastic piece on the main water reservoir that's so thin that it breaks easily.  I've broken it twice when cleaning it - luckily customer service is great and they send me free replacements.
- There's an issue with the motor where if you turn it off to add more water, then turn it on, it'll make a loud bubbling noise as it tries to get water up to the top.  It fixes itself if you turn it on and off repeatedly, but it's a pain.

I usually let the fountain run 2-3 days.  By then, the reservoir is more than half empty so I'll empty the entire thing, give it a quick wipe, then refill it with fresh water.  Once a week, I clean it with dishsoap and use a Q-tip to clean out the motor.  I'm told it isn't necessary, but I like the idea of a clean fountain.

Overall, this is much better than the Drinkwell fountain.  Not perfect, but definitely one of the best out there.  I paid $50 and it's since dropped to just over $25, which is a great deal.

The good:  Stopped my cat from peeing on the floor, most of the time. Using duct tape around all edges to secure the flimsy latch was THE trick to making this work for me.  Switching to clumping cat litter (Fresh Step is my picky cat's favorite, reduced peeing issue even more) and following the instructions of other reviewers here has made this box the box of choice.

The bad:  Why would I have to resort to duct tape in the first place?  If better quality materials and more precise manufacturing were used, there would be zero litter leaks.  How about a door to cover the front and a better sized scoop that locks in while tipping? It would get 5 stars from me if it could be made better.  There is a market for it. Who wants to vacuum up bits of litter every time the box gets tipped?

All in all this is the cheapest thing on the market that actually get the job done. I would buy it again and the cats approve it. It just needs some tweaking.

I loved it! Everything works out the way I would have done it myself, almost all the loose strings are tied off.  I felt closure, and I got an emotional roller-coaster ride on the way there.  You people who are upset because you think everything worked out too perfectly and that's not realistic; if you're looking for realism what are you doing reading a book about vampires and warewolves, excuse me, shape shifters?  Isn't real life depressing enough that you want to read stuff that makes you more depressed? I would rather read something that is uplifting, like this book.
Good job Stephenie Meyer.  The only thing that bugs me is, what happens to Leah?

I am a long-time IT professional with enough certifications (mostly Microsoft) to make a large can of alphabet soup, and this is my first Mac.  I had played with a few of them here and there years ago, and never saw what people liked about them.  The closest I ever came was back in the late '90s when I was tempted to run Windows on a PPC, but just about the time I was going to do that, Microsoft pulled their support for it from Windows, and that ended that.
So, I was anti-Mac for quite a few years.  All that has changed.  I began to believe in the OS when Apple began to base it on Unix.  A solid, time proven technology that I trust.  The big thing that changed it all for me is VMWare.  For 70 dollars, I have the ability to run Vista Ultimate, XP, and Ubuntu Linux on OSX. My Vista Ultimate is my previous Dell (not a slouchy box, either).  It's a complete clone of my old computer.  Windows still shows it being a Dell!  Spooky.  Windows had it a 3.6 rating, and a retest of the VM on my Mac shows a 3.6 rating.  That alone earns 4 of the stars I give this machine.
Now, here's another reason why I'm so happy.  I put Office 2008 on the MBP, and I seldom have any reason to even start the Vista VM anymore.  The last two times I did, it was only because I miss the great Vista solitaire game.  That earns the fifth star -- I'm not "homesick" in the least.  I think I'll be staying right here on planet Mac.  As a matter of fact, I got a MacBook for my wife, I liked this MBPro MB471LL/A so much!  Bought her the MB403LL/A.
I use it with an external monitor about 90 percent of the time, so the glare of the glossy screen hasn't been an issue for me.   The built in screen is gorgeous, and I've not been in a situation where glare became an issue.
This machine is truly desktop horsepower in a gorgeous carved aluminum notebook chassis.  I'm a very happy camper.

We got this for Christmas and have been using it steadily for the last 5.5 months.  We LOVE it.  Yes, it is noisy, and no, it never seems to make enough.  But that's because it tastes so good!  Seriously, though, we have also had the slushy problem once, and I think it was caused by opening the freezer a couple of times before using it-- so it wasn't quite as cold as usual.  Normally, we make our 'mix,' chill it and then let the machine work its magic for about 20 min., and voila, perfect ice cream.  (Because it is noisy, we close the door to the kitchen and wait in the living room until the time is up.)  We use whole milk instead of cream, only 1/4 cup of sugar (1/2 white and 1/2 brown), and it is delicious!  It is a little more slushy than regular ice cream, but I've always preferred soft serve to a hard chunk of ice cream anyway.  As someone has said, you can just freeze it after you make it if you prefer the more frozen consistency.  As a true ice cream addict, I can say I don't feel very guilty about indulging in our homemade ice cream.  Also, processed ice cream has started tasting waxy to me, now that I know what 'pure' ice cream tastes like.  I'd highly recommend trying this out.  Your taste buds will thank you. :-)

I've had mine for about 5 years - and I'll never get a different style.  I use the cat crystals and they work great!  My cat pees in the same place all the time, so the box has discolored a bit inside, but that's the only thing that has changed in all the years.  I took it to the kennel last month where he boarded while we were on vacation.  The folks at the kennel were very impressed.  Beats the heck out of any other style.

*SPOILER ALERT* I don't agree with many of the other reviewers here, but I think I never took this quite as seriously as they did.  The entire series has been fun, smart, humorous, and weirdly thought-provoking.  The final book was a total hot-fudge sundae.  Total fantasy.  And I had a blast reading all of it.  I don't particularly feel the need to deconstruct this half to death.  I frankly think it would have been a cop out NOT to let Bella become a vampire.  If you want to go the feminist route, she finally equals and even surpasses the insane perfection of Edward.  She becomes at least as strong as he is, and in some ways stronger.  Frankly, I've heard all the arguments in terms of what these books are supposed to be "about". *shrug* For me, these books were about something that most human beings really should give some time and thought to: restraint.  It is the theme of all four books as far as I'm concerned.  The difficulty of it, yes, but also the nobility of it.  *spoiler alert*  You may feel that the fact that the author let Bella become a vampire shows no restraint on the author's part, but the fact is that, as Edward has been the example of it, Jacob too though much less successfully and more humanly, Bella's final ability to show complete restraint in her bloodlust, completely controlling her animal urges in a way that shocks all the characters in the book, caps it for me.  For me, this has been an enormously fun romp, and the final book was as fun for me as the first.

This is indeed a slick little device. 

I'm a college student, one who makes numerous trips between my apartment and various libraries and computer labs each day, where I have to access papers and other files. I used to email the small files to myself and access them all from my account, but this tactic isn't always optimal. At the most inopportune of times it always seems that an internet connection is down or the most recent version of a file is unattached. 

So, hoping to correct this problem, I got this little toy. 

And so far--I haven't had it too long--I'm quite satisfied. It's fast, especially if you have USB 2.0, and tremendously useful whether you are transferring little MS Word files, folders of PDF articles, or an album or two of mp3s "borrowed" from a friend.

Trying to find the best balance between cost and memory capacity, I had a hard time deciding between this and the 256 MB version. I'm glad I forked over a few extra dollars for the 512 MB, however. I've found the extra space gives some nice room to keep a few music files, etc. If you are facing the same question, if you can swing the extra 10 or 15 bucks (mine came with a rebate), splurge a little for the 512 MB. It's the perfect amount of storage space.

As for the device itself: It seems quite sturdy. The rubber casing appears to make it splash resistant, etc. It's also very small and can be easily attached to a key chain without taking up much pocket space.

It comes with a black rope-keychain thing--of the type that could be worn around the neck. I hate these things, so I took the little metal ring off the rope so it could be attached to my standard key ring with greater mobility.

There is also a nice white spot to write your name and cell number or email; this way if you lose it or forget to take it out of a computer, the person who finds it can easily get it back to you.

A few MINOR complaints:
    - It doesn't look quite as cool as it does in the picture. I might even say it looks a bit different. It's a little metal stick covered in clear plastic. 
    - The changeable caps are pretty lame. They are bright pink and blue. I didn't plan on using them in the first place--I like the simple metallic look--but don't get excited about this feature.
    - The cap stays on fine now, but with a year or two of wear and tear I could see it perhaps falling of in the pockets. I'm sure you'd get your money's worth of use out of this before then, however.

ALL IN ALL: A good product for a great price. Recommended.

Bought mine refurb ~6 months ago.  I have had no problems whatsoever, and it has met or exceeded all demands I have placed at its feet.  This a powerful and well designed laptop in every regard.

Operating System:  #1 Reason to buy an Apple laptop.  I run Windows and Linux on my desktop, but for a laptop there is no reason not to go with Apple.  OSX is better in every aspect than Windows, and getting Linux to work well on most laptops is a pain in the @%$.

Screen - #1 Reason to get a MBP over a MB.  Get the matte screen.  It is simply the best laptop screen on the market.  Hands down.  I have received compliments on the actual screen from people sitting next to me.  When you see a Dell or even a Lenovo next to the MBP, their screen just looks incredibly sad, dull and washed out while the the LED backlit matte MBP is very bright and crisp.

Size/Weight:  Weighs the same as the normal MB, but slightly larger.  Five pounds is actually quite light for a laptop of this caliber.  I would prefer a 13" form factor but the MBP wins in other regards, and the larger screen is certainly welcome.  If SIZE is a major issue, you might want to consider the MB, if WEIGHT is the main issue, consider the MBA.  If you carry around a bunch of other heavy stuff or need to travel ultra-light, this may not be the laptop for you.  However, if all you carry around is a laptop, a (paper) notebook, and some papers or a book, it's not an even an issue.  I carry this laptop a few miles walking almost every day and I don't even notice it.

Quality: Top notch.  Feels solid, unlike many PC manufacturers Apple uses top quality components for ram, motherboard, power supply, etc.  If anything fails, Apple support has always been refreshingly helpful and accommodating.

Metal Case:  If it wasn't for the white plastic case, I might have bought the regular Macbook.  I think the metal case is more professional, but this may just be personal taste.  Realistically, the plastic MB is probably more durable and alledgedly gets better WiFi reception.

Power:  Used for extensive coding, video editing, photoshop, video playback, running Matlab simulations, etc.  Hasn't failed me yet.

Battery:  Decent battery life, nothing amazing.

In conclusion, if you need ultra-light, get a Macbook Air.  For all-around use or students, I think the Macbook is the best bet.  This is because I slightly prefer the Macbook keyboard, mag-latch, and form factor.  But for the pro user that wants power, expandability, an amazing screen and a professional look, the Macbook Pro is the best laptop on the market.

This is a WONDERFUL machine! We are huge coffee drinkers at my house. My husband was in the Army for 23 years and love a good strong cup of coffee. He is not easily impressed by new machines. I was stunned and amazed that after only 2 cups of the Keurig coffee brewer coffee, he has now suggested taking the old coffee maker out of the kitchen all together! This is the best price around. I did a lot of online research and you get the biggest bang for your buck here on QVC. I have three children (9 -13) who love to use this machine. The noise related to the brewing is so short that it has been no problem at all. I live in MI so I did let the machine come to room temperature before I started it up and it worked just fine. My sister lives here also and didn't wait for her machine to come to room temperature. She did have an issue with it not programming correctly, but she called the Keurig toll-free # and they had it reprogrammed and up working for her within a matter of minutes. She is more than impressed with her machine also. If you are stopping only a couple of times a week for a cup of coffee shop coffee, you will recover you money and then some from the purchase of this brewer when you brew your commuter cup at home in the morning. Get it...you will be glad you did! Enjoy!!

I have two yapping terriers that bark at anything and everything - especially when I'm not at home.  We were getting a lot of complaints from the neighbors, and rightly so.  They couldn't enjoy their backyard with all the annoying noise.  I took the chance and bought two collars.  The spray works like a charm and has stopped the barking.  The best things about the spray is that I dont have to be  around for it to work, nor do I have to worry about it causing pain.  The price was very affordable compared to store prices. Once the collar is off, they're back to their old habits, but at least I have some control.

Okay, you want to improve your health.  Everyone seems to be talking about walking as the most underrated form of aerobic exercise.  There are offers by companies and health departments to give you a free or inexpensive pedometer to encourage you to walk.

Those free or inexpensive pedometers?  Turn all of these offers down.

Pedometers are supposed to measure your steps.  These cheap ones have exaggerated steps, undercounted steps, variable steps, and so on.  They are not worth the carbon credits to manufacture.

You need something that will work.  Something dependable.  Something accurate.

You need an Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium Pedometer, with the safety strap and holder.

The Omron HJ-112 is easy to set up and personalize.  You need to calibrate it to your stride.  Then... it's off to the races you go!  You get an accurate count of steps for the day.  By the way, it doesn't pick up my pedaling when I bike to work.  And when I jog/run (about 7 mph), it records 3 miles as 2 miles (because of my lengthened stride).

The Omron HJ-112 records number of steps, aerobic steps (walking at 1 step/sec or faster for at least 10 minutes), and calories burned (I don't really pay attention to this last category).  It also gives you a 7 day memory for each category.

The holder clips to your belt or waistband, but is only partially reliable.  You must use the safety strap if you don't want to lose it!  I repeat... USE THE SAFETY STRAP AT ALL TIMES!

I'm told the batteries last about 6 months.  I'm not there yet.

If you want an accurate and reliable pedometer, try the Omron HJ-112.

I had a small 4 cup coffee maker for years but had to make 2 cups in it to taste right, even though I only drank one cup. I'd forget about the second unnecessary cup, and it would sit in the pot all day while I was at work & eventually stunk up the kitchen over time. 

This Brew 'n Go is perfect for a single serving. It heats up the water to the right temperature, which is important for brewing. If you need to make more than one cup, the brewing is done so quickly - in about a minute and a half. 

What I like about it is that it does NOT use those coffee pods, so I can use my favorite coffee and brew it extra strong - which is how I drink it.  It does have one of those permanent filter baskets, but as I had leftover paper filters, I actually prefer using a paper filter as I can easily lift out the filter for cleaning. The wet grounds stick to the permanent filter otherwise and are hard to clean out. I get the regular fluted, basket-style filters at a dollar store. They tend to sell the smaller filters there which fit this maker. I simply place the paper filter over the plastic filter and with my fingers, push the center of the paper filter down into the bottom of the cone. The flutes automatically fold up and then can easily be flattened to conform to the sides. Lightly moisten the folds to adhere to the sides if needed. No need to buy the Melita cone filters for more money. 

From the reviews I read on various "coffee pod" machines, you need to be careful to get a machine with the right amount of pressure to force the water through the coffee, and some machines do not heat the water to the right temperature so the coffee tastes rather weak. Plus the pods can get expensive. You have to make sure you get pods that fit your particular maker - one pod does not fit all - and some models, you are stuck with the coffee they offer, not your own favorite brand.

If you are debating over a filter maker or pods, this is the maker to get.

This is the best baby product yet. I am a very nervous person so swaddling my newborn with a blanket just didnt keep me sleeping @ night. I bought the swaddle me's and I don't have to worry about the blanket coming loose and covering her face. She also sleeps through the night being nice and tightly swaddled. I would highly recommend this product to everyone who has a newborn. My daughter is 2 months old and still loves to be swaddled. I will use them for as long as I can. Only thing is make sure you get newborn ones if your baby is small. My daughter is now almost 10lbs and still using the newborn one. The larger size wich is an infant one is from 7lbs to 14lbs.

Several months ago, we adopted a wonderful and VERY smart little mutt from the Humane Society. But it turned out she had separation anxiety. I work at home so it wasn't a big deal at first--but then I felt like I was stuck at home with a newborn baby--and getting extreme cabin fever! I had to pay a dog sitter just to go to the food store.

As experts suggest, I got this treat ball as a distraction. Initially she showed no interest at all--I kept pushing it around with my foot, treats would fall out and she'd scarf them up, but she just didn't get the idea of pushing it around with her nose--for months. Then suddenly the other day, she just got it. Now she loves it and will play with it until it's empty. She even learned that if it gets stuck (like against the wall or under a chair), she just picks it up with her mouth and takes it to "open ground." 

I have no idea what made her suddenly learn, but I'm going to purchase several of these balls to have around. (Because the only problem is that she pushes it somewhere out of sight--like under the bed--and I lose track of it.) I highly recommend this treat ball!!

I thought this sounded "handy"...well was I in for a surprise!  It's a whole lot more than that.  I make up a batch of fresh yogurt in my Salton, take out my amount for a new starter, put some in this great yogurt-cheese maker & still have some left for regular yogurt.  In the frig 24 hours & the whey is drained off & I have a perfect base for herbs/garlic for a delicious & healthy vegetable dip...or one that satisfies my chip loving husband, or plain as a healthy ingredient in a myriad of dishes including salads & salad dressings, snacks, soups, breads, desserts of all kinds, sandwiches, even main dishes!  
I bought this along with "Not Just Cheesecake" & "Eat Well The YoChee Way" & these great books expand this whole new (to me) delicious & healthier way to incorporate homemade yogurt-cheese into countless dishes.
Oftimes we purchase an appliance/kitchen item & use it very little...I think it's essential to have one or two good cookbooks to open up the possibilities for our use!  I Do Love my Yogurt- Cheese Maker!!!

I originally was skeptical when I first picked up Twilight last year; I had received the advanced reader from a friend and had put it off for months, since I'm not really that into sci-fi or fantasy books. Even though there is a fantasy tone to it, I couldn't put it down; I finished it within hours completely memorized with the tragic love story of Bella and Edward. I waited a long time for New Moon to come out. I have to say it was well worth the wait. As enchanting as Twilight was, New Moon is even more gripping. Even though it doesn't so much focus on Edward (like everyone wants it to, regardless of whether they admit it or not), it still is as action packed as ever. 
I read a review before purchasing the novel, which said that it dragged on in some points and Bella was still the helpless female. Not so!!! Don't believe it!! Bella's a lot stronger than in the first novel, developing some "talents" of her own. It keeps your attention from page 1 to page 563 and leaves you hanging. Which is a downside to the fact that the book was just released giving us a whole year for the next installment to be released.
I highly recommend this series, especially this book, even to people who hate fantasy. There's nothing better than a good love story. And that's what this is, an amazing love story that no one would be able to pry themselves away from the novel and maybe a box of tissues (also recommended... even I cried... several times and I don't like to cry when I read).
Read New Moon because it is simply amazing, the perfect sequel to the perfect story. Stephenie Meyer is a genius, her creativity blossoms in her second novel of the Bella/Edward series.

I was so surprised at how well this dehydrator works
 expected it to work okay but not this good!
I put 5 pounds of beef to dry, expecting it to take at least a day.
5 hours later and it was done! 
This was thicker sliced than the paper thin I usually do 
on top of that!
I love that the heater and fan are on the top 
that makes clean up after jerky 
 a breeze.
My sister just bought one too and is very happy she did.
We both contemplated on buying the Excalibur one but 
this by far is a better deal for your money.
I have had it a week now and have used it almost every day.
With the excellent quality of this dehydrator I expect to get
 many , many years of use out of it 
 
Update...
 over a year later and we  found that we needed more than one dehydrator, so we purchased  another one  of these with extra trays, screens.
we were hooked on dehydrating...so easy and no food spoilage!
We found ourselves needing even  another dehydrator to keep up with all the 
fresh produce and meats that we would purchase in bulk to save money.
This time we bought an  Excalibur  9 tray with timer.
I have to say, we should of just bought another Nesco American Harvest
FD-75PR. The Nesco dehydrated the corn faster than the high priced Excalibur and I found I did need to rotate the trays in the Excalibur, 
because the foods on the back of the trays dried faster than the foods on the front of the trays.
So ...if we need another dehydrator down the road we're sticking with
 Nesco American Harvest FD-75PR 700-Watt Food Dehydrator and putting the extra cash we save in the bank!

I really can't add that much to what has been said already. THIS SYSTEM WORKS AND IT WORKS WELL. I have used several "organizing systems" in the past and they simply didn't work or were too hard to keep track of. This system worked right into my personal way of keeping track of all I do. I use this with Microsoft Outlook.Update: I'm still using this system more than ever even after two years or so. While minor changes have occured, the system is still pretty much the same.

I have had this grill for about a month now and we use it at least three to four times a week. We have grilled chicken, fish, steaks, burgers, veggies and even peaches and at no time have we ever had a problem with smoke or anything sticking to the grill itself. As long as you always put the water in the pan and remember to spray a small amount of cooking spray on the surface you should have no problem. Also be sure to clean the top and bottom of the grill after using. I suspect some of the people that have reviewed this product and have had a problem with smoke are not cleaning it properly and old grease is more than likely causing the smoke. I would highly recommend this grill to anyone. Especially those looking to eat healthier.

This review is from: Transformers (DVD)

      



I caught this movie in the theater and was delighted at the overall feel of the movie. The CG, in my opinion, detracted from the story because it was just a blur of computer generated metal parts clanking all about. I was more interested in the human storyline. I was secretly cheering on the Decepticon Barricade because quite frankly, the S197 Mustang GT is a sexier car than the "concept" Camaro. A few weeks after I saw the film, I drove to a shopping mall and parked my Mustang. A kid walked by and yelled excitedly to his father, "A FORD MUSTANG!" I don't recall anyone ever giving off as much enthusiasm for a Ford vehicle as this child. I bet the movie did wonders for marketing the Mustang or making the new generation of Transformers fans aware of its existence, although Barricade was really a Saleen modified Mustang.

Ok, if you're like me (overweight and unmotivated) and watch The Biggest Loser and wish you could be one of the contestants and have Jillian train you then you're in luck!  Buy this DVD!  I just received the dvd today and did the First Level today.  It's been 2 and 1/2 hours since I finished and I'm still shaking and finding it hard to go up and down stairs.  I can't even imagine what she puts those poor contestants through..LOL!

I have knee pains and feet pains and usually just walk at 3mph on my treadmill.  Well, suffice to say I'm not seeing any weight loss.  And let me be honest the real reason I have knee and feet problems is because I weigh too much.  So I did the full on jumping jacks..no modified jumping jacks in this workout...Jillian tells you straight, she has 400lb people doing full jumping jacks, you can too!  And she was right.  I sure as heck can't really do the push ups but I'm sure that I will be able to eventually if I keep doing this dvd everyday for 20 minutes.

And she's right, you can't do a workout for 20 minutes and expect it to be easy...you want easy, don't get this dvd.  You want to sweat and really workout get this dvd!

I'm 5'4'' and 168 lbs.  I will let you know my progress in my comments as time goes on.  Good luck to everyone!

This is the ultimate classic in film.  This is the movie that you fell in love with as a child and keep falling in love with every time you watch the film, no matter how old you are.  This is the film that helped you see how dreams can come true and how you can appreciate your life, wherever you may be.Judy Garland does a fantastic job as Dorothy.  The ensemble cast works amazingly together.  The Wicked Witch is fantastic.  You just love to hate her!  And what about Toto?!Be transported back to the good old days when you didn't have a care in the world.  Watch this movie again and own it for life!

I have tried other swaddle blankets in the past and they didn't hold my daughters arms down...She would find a way to wiggle out of them waking her up.  This blanket is VERY secure and she won't be able to wiggle her way out of this blanket (Which is a good thing because it will keep her from scooting down into the swaddle.)  I have gotten the white micro-fleece and they are oh so soft and perfect for the winter time.  

We got this swaddle blanket when my son was two weeks old (10 lbs) and it fit him very well.  He is now 12 lbs and it is starting to get a little small around the chest area where the straps wrap around him so I will be ordering the Large which is starting at 14 lbs.

I have found this cat box to be the best by far.  It is extremely functional, convenient, easy to care for and the cats have had no problems using it except my 'old guy'.  He has always been an outdoors cat but now in his old age he is in the enclosed sun room at night so occasionally needs to use the facilities at night. I think he just does not think as he goes in it just fine but does not turn around when he does his duty. Since he is a good size cat, his rear sticks out even in the large box so oft times part of the load is on the stoop.....Oh Well! the advantages far outweigh this little inconvenience ie. the ease of cleaning, virtually no odor as it is cleaned regularly and easily, enclosed so you don't have to see what it is, fits nicely in a corner etc, etc, etc.  I am very pleased with it.

I bought the 8GB in anticipation of purchasing a netbook, and I have to say that the only way to improve it would be to make it retractable, rather than having a cap that you KNOW is going to get lost. If speed is of the essence for you, here are some sample transfer times:

Single File, 1.77GB - about 6.5 minutes
Single File, 3.5MB  - almost instantly
Multiple Files, 133MB folder - about 1.5 minutes


All my files (graphics, video, MP3, MS Office, etc.) opened and saved just fine, and deleting the above batch took about 30 seconds. Wax on, wax off. Cap it 'n' go. The lightweight, sturdy plastic can go on your keyring, in your pocket or purse, and be there whenever you neeed it. Oh, and NO BLOATWARE. No evil files on your computer! I got mine directly from Amazon with no problems. I highly recommend it!

The cuff is very easy to put on with one hand.  It has a firm part that wraps around your arm that is then secured with velcroe.  The firm part grips your arm and makes it much easier than trying to wrap a loose cloth, one-handed around your arm.  It has settings for 2 differnt individuals and keeps results for a.m. and p.m. readings so you can check your average and go back and review individual days.  It also has a setting to enable 3 readings to be taken one minute apart, so you have a good average for each measurement (this is a suggestion I have read about in taking your blood pressure - multiple readings averaged).  You can also over-ride the individual settings, so a 'guest' could use the monitor without it storing the readings under one of the normal users.  I assume the readings are accurate as I measured once at a local pharmacy's machine and it was about the same reading as my Omron unit.  It comes with an electric plug and batteries for backup/travel.  I am very pleased with the unit and feel it was very reasonable priced.

Great Product.  Great seller. I am a private pilot who used to fly at least 2 or 3 times a week. My business now keeps me out of the cockpit for months at a time  I use a flight sim program with the CH Yoke and Rudder Pedals to keep from going completely stir crazy, and I also believe that it helps keep your flying skills honed.

I have a white German Shephard who sheds a lot.  She was shedding so much that I couldn't keep up with her fur.  I was sweeping several times a day.  After I received the brush, I used it and noticed a HUGE difference in the amount of fur I was sweeping.  After the second brushing, the shedding dropped significantly.  I only have to sweep daily which is what I do anyway.
I love this product and would recommend it to anyone who has a shedding dog.  I also use it on my Shih Tzu which doesn't shed a whole lot and on my cats.
It is an amazing tool.
I did find it a bit pricey but well worth the money.  I have hard wood floors so you can imagine the sweeping.  This tool was WELL worth the money.

Worked instantly!  My[...] old daughter had been sucking her fingers for over 2 years.  Tried everything - sewing socks on her pjs at nite, dipping her fingers in vinegar, putting tape/bandaids on her fingers at nite, distracting her, helping her to develop new habits, taping gloves on her hands at nite, telling her that if she stopped sucking her fingers she could go to Disneyland.  Nothing worked.  All of it was a waste of time.  Then I found Mavala.  I prepared her for Mavala first.  I told her that we were going to get some medicine for her fingers and that it was coming in the mail (exciting for her!) I warned her that if she put her fingers in her mouth that she was going to make a funny face because it will taste so bad. (made it kind of like a fun game so she wouldn't be upset with the taste)  First nite I used it, it worked!  She was so proud of herself!  After that, she would ask for it every nite. After about 2 weeks, she stopped asking for it and the habit that I thought would never be broken was gone like a flash!  I have since recommended it to several of our friends.  One thing to keep in mind though - Don't use it on children under[...]...their taste buds aren't developed enough and it won't be as effective.

First product review, so please bare with me.

I got this computer in August, so I've been using it for a few months now. I must say that overall I am very satisfied with it. I'm going to list my two qualms first because they are relatively minor:

-Sound: I've had problems with the sound drivers for about a month now. I think this might have more to do with vista than the actual computer, though. It's not a difficult process to reinstall them.

-Battery Life: The battery life is a little dismal. You are given three modes for viewing the screen when not plugged in. High performance will drain the battery quickly (hour-hour and a half), while balanced & power saver do much better. 

On to the pros:

Wireless: Great wireless card in this computer. It was easy to set up, and runs great. 

Design: The exterior looks great, but it is prone to fingerprints. The interior on the other hand is simply awesome. I love the brushed silver finish. The computer itself is sleek as well. My friend just bought a comparable Gateway model, and I noticed it was slightly bulkier than the cr309e. 

Components: I haven't gamed or anything along those lines, but for everyday use this is more than sufficient. Vista takes up a lot of memory, so I'm upgrading to 4gig of ram soon. It's not a knock against the computer though. 2 is more than sufficient. The 14.1" screen is absolutely perfect. I bring up the analogy of the three bears because the screen feels just right..

Overall, I definitely recommend this computer. It's knocks definitely are outweighed by the positives. Sony has a reputation of putting out quality products, and this laptop is no exception.

Since I wrote the review below I have been able to put the toaster through a test of bagel toasting.  All I can say is "absolutely perfect".
With this toaster the news is "You get what you pay for".

It took some time selecting a toaster this year. Quality and Cost were our main concerns. At first we looked at several $39.00 - $59.00 toasters and felt that the quality of construction left something to desire. They were light and flimsy. If we wanted a toaster to last a short time then any of these might have worked.  We then researched the toasters in the $100 price range and found this KitchenAid.  The quality of construction, coil structure and terrific ratings made up my wife and my minds. 
The test was now to see how the toaster actually worked. Wow, did it do a fine job on a cold piece of bread. The toast was toasted through and through.  Crisp on the outside and warm/semi-soft and consistant on the inside.  The kind of toast we wanted toast to be. We also like the fact that the toaster comes with a 1 year no hasstle warranty! I can not wait for my next toasted sandwich! KitchenAid KMTT400OB 4-Slice Metal Toaster, Brushed Stainless Steel and Onyx Black Sides

My coffee maker recently died. I wasn't looking to spend any money on a coffee maker right now so I pulled one of my spares out of the attic. After going through the two that were up there, I quickly remembered why they were in the attic. I have to put a lot of coffee grounds in them to get a strong enough cup of coffee. Not true with the Cuisinart. It makes a perfect cup every time with a normal amount of grounds. The coffee is made in a reasonable amount of time and the temperature is perfect.

Quicken keeps me totally organized and on top of our personal finances. I have used it for about 6 years and get an upgrade practically free every year when I buy it along with TurboTax to do my income taxes. Amazon has had the best deal on purchasing both for the past 2 years. Prior to that, Staples had the best deal. I still shop all of the stores every year for the best price. I would recommend Quicken Deluxe to anyone who uses online banking and wants to keep track of their investments and finances.

I've purchased about a dozen pedometers over the yeears, this is by far the best.  I would never buy a pedometer without a securing clip again.  Occasionally it slips out of the holder but I do not lose it because it is also clipped on.  It measures regular steps and aerobic steps.  It saves several days of data.  Great product and well worth the cost.

I've been using my Acer Aspire One for a little over a month now, and I love it. Because I work in multiple locations, I wanted a notebook computer that would let me read and write most anywhere. As a professor, I am constantly reading journal articles and student papers. The Acer lets me do that. I can carry many documents without having to cart around a heavy bag. Plus I can comment on and edit documents, which I suspect would not be as easy to do with an ereader.

So far, the Acer runs for a satisfactory amount of time on a battery. (I bought the extra battery for about 6-7 hours of run-time per charge.) I also have had no problem connecting to wireless networks.

I purchased this pedometer for my mother-in-law as a gift and she loves it and wears it every day.  I was impressed by the digital display and how it tracks your strides and calories by your body weight.  I decided to buy one for myself and I love it.  It really makes you aware of how many steps you are taking in a day and want to strive to take more.  It also keeps a log of the past 7 days of how many steps you have taken so you can look back to see if you have beaten your previous days steps.  I have purchased cheaper models in the past, and this one blows them out of the water on accuracy!  The only downfall of this pedometer is the size, and shape.  When I place this on my front pocket of my pants, and then sit down in the car or get out of a car, it tends to get snagged on things and fall off easily. But I still would recommend this!  Great Product! Thanks Omron!

Easy, fast clean shave.  My skin might be a little oily-doesn't seem so to the touch, but the Remington powder stick helps the shaver glide and doesn't seem to gum up the shaver.  Sometimes the shaver tends to bite where the skin is not kept taut.

I bought the G5 when it came out, and wow, it was nice, very precise, but as anyone who has that mouse can tell you, pressing the middle mouse button takes quite an effort, after a few months, I had to stop using it, and go back to a far inferior mouse.  I bought the G9 recently, and am in love.  It is everything I loved about the g5, and I can use it for regular use, and not just gaming.

The g5 ended up only getting used to play games, because everything was great with the exception of the middle mouse, and rarely do you press down the middle mouse in a game.

This new g9 has all the features of the g5, just better.  The middle mouse rules, I can click it whenever I want, and it works (its odd that something like that can make someone soo happy, but if you have the g5, you will rejoice with this feature).  I can now use my wonderful, fancy mouse inside of my OS without the fear of fighting the middle mouse.

The mouse has a good texture, it feels nice, and smooth, it looks great, and everyone enjoys it.  My g5 had this "vintage" look, and it look wore out from day one (I thought it was cool, others thought I attacked the mouse with some vigor), this one looks good from day one! very comfortable, and highly customizable.

I used a friends razor mouse, and didn't like it.  I have always enjoy logitech, and there design.  This mouse is quite the departure from standard logitech fair.  It looks futuristic, and is very high priced.

It is worth every penny, and should suite everyone who desires a nice precise mouse.  I get no lag.  I can play this online in games with no programs.  I play cod 4, and this mouse is far superior to my g5.

I use this mouse with the Razer eXactMat X speed and it works perfectly.  It is the most accurate combination you can get, and both are available here at amazon for free shipping.

I waited over a year to purchase substantial personal external storage, and I have been delighted with the My Book 1TB volume.  It was easy to plug and play with my HP tablet, and the transfer rate for files from my hard drive or an external CD/DVD drive has been admirable.....having tons of uncompressed music from the massive CD collection on a single drive has been a low-priority wish for ages, and now I can do it.

My only complaint is the backup and recovery software bundled on the drive that installed on my laptop.  It slowed my machine by revving up in the background at start-up, and it's not like I *need* the planned redundancy;  so, I uninstalled it after a week.  Other than that.... and it's my own fault for letting the apps install... I'm beyond happy with my purchase.

Allright 1st off I have never tried an epilator before. I have done waxing , shaving and nair.
I have to say this product is the best solution for guys looking to get rid of unwanted hair.
Shaving gave me razor bumps and ingrown hairs and the results lasted only for a day. 
Nair was the same thing ( ingrown hairs ).
Waxing is just too mesy and can be kind of hard to do by yourself in certain areas.
This epilator works just fine and the results lasted for a solid week before I had to go back and re epilate.
The special massage head does help to reduce some of the pain and the built in light helps make sure you don`t leave any stray hairs.
My advice for you men looking for a better alternative to shaving or waxing would be this product.
Here is what I myself found usefull :
1   There is pain involved. So if you are a wuss don`t bother. But cmon now if a sexy lil gurl can do this why can`t you ???
2   Wash skin with warm water before epilating to open up your pores making the process a lil easier.
3   This is NOT an electric razor so don`t use it the way you would a razor. SLOW steady strokes making sure you let the machine get all the lil hairs. If not your going to end up with a lot of strays.
4   After you are finished epilating I recommend you use PRINCE REIGNS INGROWN HAIR SERUM on the epilated area.
5   Exfoliate your skin,   this can be done easily while in the shower with a luffa make sure you scrub really well to get rid of all the dead skin to help minimize any ingrown hairs.
6   If possible epilate before going to bed. This way you allow your skin to heal while you sleep.
So yeah it does hurt but the end result is worth it. After a while you get used to the pain involved. The best way to describe the pain if your wondering would be that same feeling you get when your leg has fallen asleep and starts to get all the lil needle prickling sensesations.
The most painfull areas I found where around the belly button and around the knee.
Hope this review helps any of you guys wondering if this is for you or not.

Pulled it right out of the box and it worked great. I had Comcast installed that afternoon, hooked the router right up and did the normal setup and did not have one problem.

The router seems to have a problem with the WMP300N network card but I will put the review on that side. All three of my laptops get 5 bars and great speeds so I am placing the blame on the desktop card.

This is concerning the 4G Surf models only.  Amazon throws all the reviews (and product specs) under one heading, even thought here are some differences between them.  That isn't Asuss fault; it is Amazon's, but I wanted to point his out.

Here are some things to keep in mind with this:
There is no web cam with the 4G Surf. (no big deal to me, but others should know)

The 4G Surf memory is upgradeable, but it is a project compared to the 4G.  It isn't impossible, but it is more in depth and I am putting that off for another week or so.  The extra memory is inexpensive though, and I definitely would encourage picking up 1G.

After being on for a while (maybe an hour, maybe two) the touch pad loses all sensitivity.  The design seems to have heat sinks under the touch pad (just a guess) and it heats up just enough to make it useless.  I recommend you also purchase a USB mouse so you aren't stuck.

It arrives with Linux installed, and it is wonderful.  I am keeping my system Linux, though I may install Ubuntu.  The only problem I found with Linux is it isn't compatible with my Canon software.  Therefore, I also bought a small compact flash card reader so I can transfer my photos.  The image editor included doesn't support Canon's RAW format, which is what I shot, but it does support most others.

Pick up a SD card to use for extra space.  I bought the 8G Amazon has for less then $40.  The laptop recognized it right away, but my two other systems weren't able to.  

All things considered, I believe this will be the next wave in computers.  I would recommend this to almost every one.

I bought for a Christmas Gift for wife. She had no idea I was getting her dream mixer that she always wanted for years. After I bought it it came within a few days it was well packaged. Wife was very shocked to get it for Christmas. I too was later shocked with all she baked from it.  Wow !!!!  now we both love your mixer thanks........

I've owned this stick for a few years now, and its been nothing but fantastic. The mechanics and buttons are extremely reliable and provide good tactile feedback. The movement is consistent, and over the years the stick hasn't lost a bit of its precise feel and reliability. The stick feels quite sturdy when used, though it can sometime move a little around the desk if the rubber feet aren't clean.

The movement of the stick takes a little getting used to, as it has a tendency to 'stick' when crossing the X or Y axis. I believe this is due to the way its constructed, and once you get used to it its hardly noticable. In fact, it makes it easier to make movements of the stick directly along the X or Y axis without having to worry about drifting to either side.

The software is excellent and provides a wealth of customizability. A full scripting language is provided as well as simple keyboard and mouse emulation (with enough buttons to make it worth while).

There are replacement parts (though I've never needed any) available from the manufacturer on their webpage which provides a nice feeling of security should anything eventually go wrong. 

On the down side, the stick may be a little large for some hands (I sometimes have difficulty reaching the secondary fire button with my thumb without shifting my hand on the stick) and it lacks any kind of rudder control (which means you'll probably have to purchase some extra peripheral to provide rudder, I use the CH pedals which I would highly recommend as well).

This stick is hands-down the best joystick I've ever owned.

Whoever designed this thing was thinking.  Given what's likely to happen to these things in use, I think Sandisk hit the nail on the head.  A metal device with a clear plastic overshell.  It's small, and it will hold a ton of pictures or files, whatever you need to drag around.  I could put this on my keychain and not have to worry about it breaking.  If this device is as good as the other Sandisk flash products I have from an operating perspective, this will be a real winner for them.Nice job Sandisk....If you need or want a USB flash drive, get this one...

Ordered 10pm January 7 from BuyNow through Amazon.  Received via FedEx January 9.  
I removed it from the well packaged boxes.  Since I live in PA and it had been in a cold environment I let it warm up to room temperature.  That night I plugged it in and started Windows XP for the first time. Within 15 minutes I was up and running on Fios internet. 
I've been using it for about 2 weeks now.  
Good stuff:  It takes up very little space on my desk and I can carry it back and forth to work easily.  Boots up very quickly.  I don't have to plug it in constantly, the battery really does last over 5 hrs.  Webcam is easy to use. People look at it and say, "it's cute".
Not so good stuff: As others have said the smaller keyboard and touchpad take some getting used to.  The top really is a fingerprint smudge magnet.  At least I'll know if anyone uses it without asking permission.
 Bottom line - Glad I bought it.

I hate shaving and did a lot of research before buying this razor.  I have a very thick beard that looks like I have not shaved by noon.  With conventional razors, I cannot shave against the grain due to my very coarse beard and sensitive skin.  I love this razor.  Since buying the razor I have gotten the closest shave ever without razor burn like most electric razors.  I shave after taking a shower, but have used it both ways.  I have found it is a bit closer when shaving after getting out of the shower, but both ways are very comfortable on your face.  Believe me when I say this thing is a hidden gem in the razor world.  My life of shaving has become 100 percent easier and it is actually enjoyable to shave now, versus the conventional way that I have used my entire life.  I hope this helps someone looking for a razor that is in my situation, coarse beard, sensitive skin, best razor ever.  

The only con to the razor which I have found with all electric razors is that the area around your neck is hard to shave and may require a conventional razor about once a week even if you do a great job shaving....

I couldn't wait to open the box when it was delivered. I plugged it in and sharpened about 12 of our kitchen knives. Afterward, I called our daughter and told her how great this sharpener worked, and told her to bring her knives to our house and I would sharpen them. She brought about 17/18 and I spent the next 1/2 hour taking care of all her knives. I would recomend this model sharpener to anyone looking for a great, not too expensive sharpener. I love it.

We love our ice cream maker!!!!! I got it as a "late" Valentine's gift and we have had so much fun with it. Its extremely easy to use, makes great ice cream of high quality,  and is lots of fun! In 20 minutes you can have "soft serve" and with a two hour wait for ripening you can have "hard" ice cream. I don't usually like small appliances but this one is worth it if you spend bucks at ice cream stands, or on fancy store ice cream. To lower claoires you can substitute 2 percent milk and half and half for the cream and it tastes fine. Much better than store bought.

We had an electric juicer that I hated - rickety, and really loud. So we got one of the press type - non-electric. Almost 100 bucks from Williams Sonoma and it was useless - it does not get nearly all the juice out of the fruit. So we finally got this one, and I love it! It's quiet, gets all the juice out, and the price is definitely right.

The machine overall does an adequate job.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and always leave the bowl in my freezer so that it is ready to make a batch of ice cream.  I find that it makes the ice cream a soft-serve consistency so that I need to put the ice cream in the freezer to firm up.  It is easy to use and I do recommend this model.

I am only reviewing this last book, but all the books are well deserved 5 stars. Especially this last book, that is just jaw dropping, nail biting, cant put down amazing. 
Stephanie Meyers dream, started and ended with a spellbinding, ultimate mind blowing world, and heart stopping romance. I tip my hat to you Ms Stephanie Meyer, for these blissfully wonderful books you dreamed up. I loved the way you ended the saga. All the books were your dream of what vampires were, and only your dream. So the way you ended it, shouldn't be up to the fan's idea of what is a Twilight world, but to your own world, a world I am proud to be a part of. 
 I see a whole new series... in this last book, hopefully you go there, and it will be to my delight.

Side note: Thanks for letting your books be in Kindle. I have arthritis, and its hard holding books, this new way of reading is a blessing to my hurting wrists, and I only wish more authors would put their books in the amazon Kindle.

Just got my new 9595 Braun in the mail, and even though I have only used it twice I'm so far impressed. This
shaver replaced my old Norelco James Bond series which the battery started to go after two years. The Braun
9595 cuts better than my old norelco, and does not pull and rip the hairs like the norelco. Another great thing
about the Braun is that after several minutes of shaving it does not get hot on the skin, and the cleaning system
is great, the shaver feels new after it goes through it's cleaning cycle. The price is a little steep, but it seems to
be a good foil shaver so far, only time will tell, but I would at least refer this type of shaver to a friend.

It is a little complicated for me to get started for me but once I had it figured out I love it. I still don't have all the extras figured out but it gives and exellent picture. When I burnt dvd on the canon DW 100 I had to call in to get assistance and  they were very helpful. I did want to play the dvd on my dvd player and it requires a blueray or play it through the DW 100 burner. I can set the camera to a lower quality but haven't tried it yet. I like the hard drive so I don't have to worry about disc or tapes. Set on the SP mode I have almost 12 hours record time which is one thing I looked for before buying. There are also 2 higher quality modes but have less record time or 1 lower quality mode with longer record time.

I have been using the Keurig B-40 for over 7 months now and have been very impressed with it.  It heats up very quickly, and the auto shut-off feature allows you to have your machine shut down after 2 hours of inactivity.  You can use the B-40 for brewing tea by buying tea in K-cups, but I simply and frugally put my tea (either loose in strainer or in a bag) in a cup and run the Keurig without a K-cup in the holder.  I use the Keurig in a similar manner to add hot water to cups of soup.

As mentioned in other reviews, the 7.25 oz brewing size is fine for a single regular cup, but small for a big mug or travel mug.  Furthermore, the strength of the coffee that you get with the regular K-cups is too weak for my taste.  The regular K-cups are better suited to one of the other Keurig brewers (B50 or B60) where you have the option of changing your brewing volume to 5.25 oz.  The caveat is that you have even less coffee.  The Extra-Bold K-cups that vendors are now selling actually do brew a great cup of coffee in the 7.25 oz size and I would recommend that you order Extra-Bold versions of your coffee if you like your coffee stronger.  K-cups are a fantastic convenience - easy to use and easy to dispose of. Maybe too easy - I blasted through my first box of 25 in the first week at work.  They are not cheap either, at between 40 and 50 cents a cup if you search for deals.  However, the Extra-Bold varieties are fairly limited in availability.   An accessory that I highly recommend - the Keurig 5048 My K-Cup Reuseable Coffee Filter - allows you to fill its reusable basket up to the rim with your favorite ground coffee.  If you fill it all the way it makes a very strong cup of joe - just the way I like it.

Pros:
Price
Convenience
Utility
Looks cool on your desk
Great coffee with Extra-Bold K-Cups or optional Keurig 5048 My K-Cup Reuseable Coffee Filter

Cons:
Single 7.25 oz brews coffee that is too weak with regular K-cups
Fairly limited selection of Extra-Bold K-cups
Cost per cup is pricey

I bought this MSI WIND in DEC-24. It was delivered by AMAZON in time.

On performance... it outperforms my old DELL INSPIRON 6000 which also has a 1.6GHZ Processor, but not the ATOM of the MSIWIND, which, by the way, is Hyperthreading, which just rocks. It runs pretty well with just 1GB of RAM included. It really outperforms with 2GB. Which is better: almost no heat, even when processor has been all day busy scanning the hard drive for viruses.

The battery lasts nearly 5hrs or more (if using the battery life extender feature). 

Bluetooth is cumbersome to use. I've not been able to put Activesync to work yet.

Great size. I cannot imagine typing this review on a smaller keyboard.

After some days of using it, I found a little crack under the battery. It does not seem to be leaking any power or chemical there anyway.

It's made in China, which made me initially doubt on the quality of the battery and other chemical related stuff. 

A bad note for MSI support is that they dont have warranty support in Latin America. So I bought a travel device, and if I want support I have to send it back to the US.

I will probably be sending the battery back to the US for a replacement, once I get one to work while this one is in transit.

All in all, good product, good performance, good size, good battery life, no heat, good camera, good microphone, good jacks and ports. 
One battery crack and poor support overseas for a traveling device.

Great iPod, the graphics are incredible, sound is very clear.  Storage capacity is excellent.  The sound through the ear buds is crisp and clear so high volume is not necessary.

I tried this video on my cable's "on Demand" and I will definitely be purchasing it!  There is NO WAY that you cannot shape up quickly and completely if you follow this workout!  Jillian ROCKS!  Her combinations keep you moving and working and sweating, but she has a way of making you able to keep up, through both her motivating talk, as well as the way she combines the moves.  She has made me a big fan of circuits - you can endure much more!  Her explanations of exactly what muscles you're targeting REALLY make you motivated to push extra hard, as well as focus on them to really bring on the intensity! I have been doing the 30 day Shred, which I will continue to alternate with this on days that I cannot do an hour, but this is one video I know I will make time for - it is sure to work! *** Okay I'm just updating here after 15 days to say that I am actually seeing changes DAILY in my body, and a 6 pack is being revealed.

It's indeed as light as advertised. Battery time for usage seems to be less than 2.5 hours, which is not that long. The screen is small -- 7" makes sure your windows are all maximized if you want to read anything. Yahoo! Mail doesn't load properly because the screen is too small. YouTube flash videos are sometimes a little jumpy, probably CPU issues. Other than that, everything works fine -- the Messenger application is the one I use on other machines (Pidgin), so I just imported connections. The browser is Firefox 2. OpenOffice allows me to load most documents in. The auto-suspend-on-lid-close feature is wonderful, I just close it and put it in my backpack with no further thought. PDFs are read using Adobe Reader, not one of the open source alternatives, which I was not used to, but it works OK. "openvpn" cannot be installed without further fiddling -- I have not managed to do so yet. The keyboard is a bit tiny, and makes me do more typos than I'm used to. On heavy use, it will heat up.

I've used and still use professional espresso machines at work for years, and this one is right up there. I couldn't believe the quality of crema and how easy and great the frothing wand was. For the money this machine cannot be beat. This is the real deal. The espresso is perfect, the foaming wand actually works better and more easily than many of the pro machines I've worked with (although I can make great foam with any of those too), which was definitely a pleasant surprise. Easy to use and smartly designed. I posted some photos of the espresso I had today.  

I must say that I tried the Illy pods just to see how they worked and found the crema lacking, once I switched to Illy loose Espresso gring (medium roast) I had perfect results most every time. So perhaps not the best for someone who wants to only use pods. But pods end up being more expensive anyways.  The other thing that surprised me about this machine was that it does not stop the shot automatically, so you decide when your shot is finished. Good for some, perhaps a learning curve for others. I've always heard 20-30 seconds is the appropriate length of time to pull a shot.

The safety clip has kept it from hitting the pavement more than once. The price was excellant. I bought a differant pedometer at a sporting goods store and paid $30.00 for it. It was a piece of junk, my son couldn't even figure out how to work it. I took it back, and bought the Omron HJ-112 the next day. I would recomend this to everyone.

....and I have tried them all!  So easy and fast I'm almost embarassed to tell you my daughter and I have made some every day since I received it.  I suggest you just experiment with recipes, they are foolproof!  We tried substituting flavored jello for the sugar and it works great!  We've tried peach & strawberry so far.  We found fat-free half and half and use skim milk instead of the whipping cream.  We HAVE to, remember, we make some every day!!

We had heard about the FURminator and saw pictures on the web site. We cannot believe the ease of use and amount of hair we get off of our dog.  We have a chocolate lab and it makes his coat look great besides decreasing the hair in the house.  We highly recommend.

This is an excellent consumer or even prosumer grade camcorder. Image quality is great and indoor light image quality is much improved over the first Sanyo HD 1 from 2 years ago. As some have complained about the image stabilization control, it is true to some degree. Walking while shooting will produce nearly as great a shaking image as not using the image stabilization. However, if your standing still and moving the camera in normal, non jarring movements, it will do a good job of stabilizing the image. This too is an improvement over the old HD 1 (which I still own), but I believe it's one area where Canon has an advantage, using  optical instead of digital image stabilization. Sanyo's advantage for me is in the ergonomics of the design and the price.It comes down to what's more important to you.Finally, the free Nero editing/DVD/Blu-Ray authoring is very good for editing even 1080p HD footage. It could be more intuitive in its functions, but once you learn it, it's easy.

Setting up the Linksys was a threefold pain, but after wrestling with the configuration I'm consistently getting 54Mb throughout my house. I flip the thing on and forget about it.

The three obstacles in setting up the WAP54G were:

1) The auto-setup program on the included CD continually blew up. My online chat with tech support led nowhere, the chat session dropping about 20 minutes in.

2) My private subnet doesn't include the factory default IP for the Linksys (or most other network devices), so I had to temporarily switch over my PC and router IPs and subnets to connect to the WAP54G's config web server. Note this isn't the fault of Linksys, but food for thought if you have to do a manual configuration from an "unconventional" private subnet.

3) The documentation doesn't give a lot of guidance on setting up WPA2 security for a Windows client. After a great deal of web sleuthing I discovered from Microsoft's site that my XP Pro SP2 notebook required a download to support WPA2.

Asus is a great company that has push the Low Coast UMPC market into the future.  The Only thing I can say bad about the Eee PC 900 is that the Eee pc 901 is now coming out with more features.  Although you could install Windows XP on this unit I would advise against it. Of course I advise installing Windows on and computer.  Not only is Windows slower and bulkier the Linux, you have to worry about viruses due to the lack of security on a Microsoft System.  

The Webcam works great, better then I expected.  You can very easily install a full desktop if you don't like the default easy mode.

You know it's a good product when all the other big name companies are scrambling to make products that are competitive for it.

After not using my stand model KitchenAid Mixer for the past 5+ years it I decided I really didn't need it. I used my ancient handmixer when needed. I found a very grateful friend and made a deal for the stand mixer. Then made the decision to get the best KitchenAid hand mixer I could find. So with the help of Amazon Reviews I chose this model. The price I found on Amazon was the best available. And believe me I researched it. I've used it a few times and it was perfect. The look, the feel and the end results were all as I would have expected.
NEWSFLASH:Unit died after about 1 1/2yrs. of minimal use. Contacted Kitchen Aid and was given a refurbished unit with 6month warrenty. They were easy to work with. Actually got a real person on the phone right off the bad. Not sure how I'm feeling about all this.So far new unit works well.

It's not a high end product, so my expectations aren't high.  I bought this unit intending to use it for a wireless access point on my wired network at home.

It meets that need very well.   Fast, easy to set up for a passive access point, and no problems with 128 bit encryption.

I do notice that it gets a little hot with use, so I stood it upright in the stand that came with it, and it seems to run cooler that way.  I wonder if that's the root of some of the service problems people are seeing.  

I'll see what kind of service it gives over the long term, since it will  get intermittent use when the kids are home from school with their wireless notebooks.

I purchased this bread machine because of favorable reviews and I have not been disappointed. It makes a whole regular size loaf, as opposed to a small vertical loaf, and does a great job with whole wheat flour.

An outstanding coffeemaker. Very hot ("Starbucks" temperature)water and slow, steady brew (worth the wait) make for perfect "Starbucks" quality coffee at home. Heavy and solidly built; seems highly durable. Simple, uncluttered controls. Very attractive design which will fit with any style kitchen. It comes in all brushed steel or in combination with black or white. White is perfect for kitchen with white appliances. I have had Krups or Braun for many years.  This is so far superior that I would buy one even if I did not need a new coffeemaker.

I gave Twilight a 5 star rating but New Moon gets a slightly lower rating because this is where Bella started to get on my last nerve. I still enjoyed reading the book but I found Bella to be a bit pathetic. I understand being young and in love but come on - she's in a nearly catatonic state because her boyfriend left her? Then she nearly kills herself just to hear his voice?? That's not love, that is just stupid. It became clear in this book that Bella has no life, hobbies or anything outside of Edward. I also find the way that she uses Jacob to be disgusting, something that only gets worse in Eclipse and Breaking Dawn. Even with all that said, it was still a very enjoyable, suspenseful and interesting book to read.

Just replaced the foil and cutter block that came with my Braun 8975 electric shaver, after almost 14 months of daily use. The foil in the original had some breaks in it.  As soon as I used the replacement, I noticed how smooth the shaver felt on my face.  The User Guide indicates that the foil/cutter block should be changed after 18 months of use, but I had to do so sooner, perhaps because I press too hard when shaving.  If I want a really close shave, I wind up using my Gillette Fusion Power razor.  No matter how I twist and turn the Braun, I can't seem to get as smooth a result on my neck, as I do on my face.  I do not have to use the razor every day.  I would say that my Braun 8975 is the best electric shaver that I ever had and I think that the foil/cutter block have a good deal to to with that conclusion.

I bought this machine for my girlfriend for Christmas. The unit is very solid from what I can tell, nice chrome outside with the top and bottom trays having a different metallic look to it (could be the infamous metallic finish that is discussed in other reviews, which apparently can bubble off. Some reviewers were worried that the internal parts might have this same metallic finish and it could contaminate the coffee but I highly doubt this as there would be no reason to use this finish on internal parts as it is purely asthetic and would serve no purpose on the inside).

The machine comes with the basics but the manual is definitely lacking. At the suggestion of another review I went and downloaded the manual for the Sunbeam Cafe Crema EM4800C espresso machine (supposedly the same model) and it is much better and I would recommend downloading it to anyone buying this machine http://www.sunbeam.com.au/Pages/Browse/ProductDetail.aspx?pid=1129

I gotta admit I was a little intimidated at first when I was going to use the machine, first time I had used one, but it was easier then I thought and the first espresso i made was pretty tasty with the second one being even better (I used espresso beans ground at the espresso setting from a local store, used the double filter with 2 scoops and a slight tamp to even it out). I also tried out the frothing attachment and, despite what other reviews have said, I was able to take cold milk and get it up to temp (between 140-160) and frothing, this took probably around 90 seconds or so and if I had used less milk probably would of been quicker. On a negative note, I was not that impressed with the cup warmer. I had the machine on for a good 10-15 min and it never seemed to get that hot but there are other ways to warm a cup. 

Overall I am impressed with this machine and would recommend it to others as a nice low price espresso machine. Some people may not like that it's pressurized filter but for a beginner like myself and my GF I think it's a plus as I don't have to worry to much about having the exact grind/tamp. I cannot comment on the longevity of this item yet but I will follow-up this review as time passes.

Twilight brought me back to my teen years and the intense emotions I felt.  I loved the combinaton of self-consciousness, invinsibility and thrill.  I devoured New Moon for it captured the pain I once experienced so vividly, and the notion that time does heal wounds, and that we can indeed experience happiness again...however devoid of passion.  I loved it also because it developed the characters so much deeper, and I fell in love with all of them-I got to know them and liked them!

I however did not like Eclipse.  While I enjoyed some of the romantic moments and the thrill and understood Bella's conflicted love, I felt the dialogue at times was unecessary and did not add to the character development.

I was fearful of Breaking Dawn but it turned out to be a fantastic end to the fantasy.  Many reviews complain of the happy ending and how everything fell into place for Bella.  However, I found it to be perfect!  I had read over 1500 pages of gut wrenching emotions, thrills, fears and loss in the first 3 books and I was so ready to embrace and indulge in happiness.  Breaking Dawn delivered that and much more.  I cried and gasped many times as I read this last book, however, I very much enjoyed the many tender love scenes.  It gave me the opportunity to balance out all the strong emotions I had felt during the series and for me at least, it closed the circle.   what a fantastic ride!  Thank you Stephenie

I've been traveling the past two years and it was only a few months ago when I decided to get a Macbook Air. With my older non-ultra portable laptop, my backpack was always heavy. In fact, it made up for 80% of my handcarry's weight. You have to consider that many laptop companies do not include the weight of the removable battery and the power adapter in their laptop's specs. I've heard of Macbook Air before but I had been hesitant to buy one because it didn't look that sturdy in the store compared to the Macbook Pro and I thought that its processing power was extremely lowered to unbearable levels.

When I bought the Macbook Air, I knew what I was getting. First, it's going to have less disk space and less processing power, just one USB drive and no CD/DVD drive. So I'm not going to complain about those things knowing that this is not supposed to replace my desktop computer. And it was supposed to be a computer I can bring along while traveling for writing e-mails and surfing the net. I occasionally play games and I don't do video editing or use CAD.

PROCESSING POWER
But to my surprise, it was more powerful and faster than I expected. It's faster than my iMac. When you click on the Dashboard icon on the dock, all your widgets will load instantly and not even take longer than 2 seconds. Opening multiple programs at the same time did not slow down the computer at all.

I used to play World of Warcraft before I bought this laptop and plan to be playing again next year. I was thinking that I wouldn't be able to play WoW with a decent frame rate on this machine but I've been reading forums and they said WoW performs really well in MBA's with SSD drives.

KEYBOARD AND SCREEN
Another nice touch is the screen and keyboard size. Ultraportable used to mean small ultra light weight BUT ultra small screen and almost impossible to use keyboards. Macbook Air didn't sacrifice screen size and keyboard keys size. One thing I noticed was that the backspace button was renamed Delete and the real delete button was missing. But it really didn't become an issue with me later on. I'm one of those few people who like to crank up the brightness to its max level. I'm so happy with the level of brightness and crispness MBA has to offer. And the brightness is easy and fast to adjust, thanks to the keyboard shortcuts.

TRACKPAD
With the other laptops that I used before, I wouldn't survive a day without using a USB mouse. But MBA's trackpad is completely functional without straining the joints of my thumb. I don't do the new gestures at all. But being able to move the cursor when I want it to go without making my scalp sweat is such a blessing.

OPTICAL DRIVE
I bought the external DVD drive from Apple and it's funny how I've only used it to burn a couple of movies and install MS Office. I found myself not using the drive much because I don't: a) install applications from CDs/DVDs on a daily or even weekly basis, b) listen to CDs using my computer or c) burn data on DVD-Rs.

ONE USB PORT
My complaint about MBA is that it only has 1 USB drive. But take note that the port for the external monitor is separate from the USB drive. I thought that if I plugged my MBA to my monitor, I'd lose the valuable USB slot but I was wrong. 

FORM FACTOR
Well what can I say? Great design! I was hesitant at first to take it out of my bag in a coffee shop when I realized that MBAs are more common than I thought. MBAs don't scream anymore, "Look at me wasting money!" like before. And people are used to seeing MBAs these days so you can take your laptop out and do your thing without grabbing attention.

When you get this laptop and give it a whirl for a few days, you will be surprised that it offers more functionality over form. If you want a powerful laptop that you can carry around without breaking your back and has a nice display and keyboard, this one's for you.

I was looking at the new Sony Vaio ultraportable which promises almost double specs at half the price of MBA plus support for Blu-Ray. But if you play around with the specs in their website and max it out to double the specs of MBA, it'll cost more than $4,000.

Wall-E is a cute film about a robot who takes trash and compacts it 
like the auto trash dump does. Then a new robot comes to earth to find
something, and Wall-E falls in love with it. 

When the other robot starts to jet back to its home planet, Wall-E follows
behind. Things start to happen on the spaceship and Eve the other robot
tries to help him get back to earth.
In the process, Eve starts to care for Wall-E.

It is kind of silly for robots to fall in love, it kind of shows kids what
it is like for adults when they start to have feelings for another person.
In not as graphic a way as an R rated movie would show.
I think it is a cute way to show kids about feelings.

Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper

I received my Whirley Popper last week, tried it out today, and I am VERY happy.  The popcorn tastes just like it does at the movie theater or a carnival.  The corn is light, fluffy, and crispy in contrast to the bagged microwave corn which is much less crunchy and stale-tasting, in my opinion.

It is very easy to use and I only had a couple of kernels that were un-popped.  Be sure to follow the directions EXACTLY which includes seasoning the Whirley Popper prior to first use and using a MEDIUM flame, not high.  Yes, the popper does feel rather light but then again, popcorn making does not require heavy-duty machinery.  Do I get a little worried that the crank my break?  At times yes, but as long as I'm careful it should be fine.  Also Wabash Valley Farms has great customer service so I will not hesitate calling them with any problems.

As for the popcorn sent with the popper (which has no bearing on my rating) I thought it was pretty good, but a bit too salty for my family's taste.  My advice is to use only half of the seasoning provided if you intend on using Wabash Valley Farm brand.  I am sure any brand of fresh popcorn kernels will do so there is no need to experiment with any expensive fancy-shmancy brands - unless you'd like to .... again so long as the corn is fresh it should come out great.  Moreover if the popper is going to be used at least once or twice a week, there really is no need to wash it because you remove the seasoning as well; just wipe it out with a wet cloth.

The booklet included with the popper comes with a few interesting recipes that I want to try out including the kettle corn.

UPDATE:

Well I've had my Whirley Pop for a few weeks now and have used it almost two dozen times and I love it.  My popcorn nor the popper have gotten burnt.  I just ordered one for my sister and this will also be one of my mother's Christmas gifts. Case (24) of 4 Ounce Great American Popcorn Portion Packs

I don't know what took me so long to finally order this.  I've had the litter box for over a year now and was getting really fed up with the super high prices of the refills and that fact that I could never seem to remember to order it in time.  About 2 weeks ago I was at target and saw they had the same crystal litter in a 8 lb bag for 13 dollars, that drew the line. That is 2 months of litter for 13 dollars, or 40 dollars in trays. So I went ahead and got the litter for 13 dollars and a roll of disinfecting wipes for 3 dollars and came home and ordered this tray.  I've had the tray for about 5 minutes and was so happy I just had to write this review! This is going to save me hundreds of dollars I already know, the quality is so great, I know it will probably outlast the box itself. I have 100% faith in these guys, they included a lift kit for the 1% of of the boxes out there that had a problem, that says so much right there. All I can really say is Thank You... seriously THANK YOU!!!

I was in fourth grade when south park came out back in 1997, now here we are heading into 2009 and the creator's of the show Matt Stone and Trey Parker are still coming up with stories based in immature humor but paired with intelligent and witty story premises very relevant to today's pop culture. The twelfth season contains the following fourteen classic episodes as well as some special features that previous sets have been lacking. 

Britney's New Look - Rather than mock the mess Britney Spears was, this episode mocks those of us who put her there and those trying to take her place.
 
Tonsil Trouble - Cartman ends up with aids, and he's hiv positive that he wants to find a cure. 

Major Boobage- Kenny gets high off cat urine and lives the 'heavy metal' lifestyle. 

Canada Goes On Strike- I'm canadian and love that they used us to mock the writer's strike of last year. 

Eek, A Penis!- Mrs. Garrison comes full circle. Or is that Mr. Garrison? 

Over Logging- Instead of commenting on natural resource over use like oil or forestry Matt and Trey decide to comment on our over dependency on the internet. 

Super Fun Time- A pioneer village field trip turns into the plotline of several hit eighties movies when terrorists take over the fun park and Cartman and Butters skip out. 

The China Probrem- Beijing Olympic's get Cartman paranoid of the Chinese while Kyle and Stan deal with the disappointment of Steven Speilberg and George Lucas 'raping' Indiana Jones for profits. 

The Breast Cancer Show Ever- Cartman becomes a cancer to Wendy, the only way to stop cancer is to fight it. 

Pandemic- The boys get Craig involved in a scheme that goes wrong, meanwhile Randy goes 'cloverfield' with his new video camera when furry monsters begin attacking. 

Pandemic 2- The Startling- I'm so startled, and so is Randy as Craig and the boys finish saving the world again with more unrealistic twists than the latest Hollywood blockbuster's. 

About Last Night- Instead of mocking the presidential candidates like everyone else we see a twist on their stereotypes when election night turns into a heist movie for the O'Bama and McCain tickets. Meanwhile the boys parents get out of control celebrating the 'change'. 

Elementary School Musical- I hate High School Musical, and luckily for me so do Matt, Trey and the boys. Rather than dance and sing a boy wants to play basketball but his dramatic father won't allow it. 

The Ungroundable- Butters unwillingly joins the 'Twilight' crowd while the Gothic kids try to stop the 'vamp' craze at it's source, the local Hot Topic store. 

This season is the first to be released on Blu-ray as well as DVD, though it appears as standard full screen on the DVD, the Blu-Ray is widescreen 1080i with DTS 5.1 Audio. The new special features provided are probably better suited for die hard fans or those interested in animation but personally if it's between having these and none at all I'd rather the option of watching these. The special features are: 

Making Boobage: Behind The Scenes Of "Major Boobage" 
-Four scenes from the Heavy Metal parody are broken down and shown to us in several stages as producer Eric Stough gives a commentary on how they blended it all together for a final result.

Six Days to South Park, A Day By Day: Making of South Park
-This is less featurette and more commentary. It finds the production crew giving a rather long commentary over several stages of incomplete animation discussing the changes that are made on each of the six days leading up to the air date. We get to see 'Super Fun Time' slowly transform from the storyboard animatic stage to the near final cut.

Behind The Scenes: "About Last Night" 
-This is essentially another commentary by the creative crew lead by Eric Stough. They talk over a rough cut of the episode and discuss how most of it was made last minute on the sixth day of production which was the last day before it aired.

Matt and Trey will also provide the same mini commentaries they have provided on every season set since the complete third season. I always find these enjoyable and entertaining. They also manage to give alot of information considering each commentary tends to be under five minutes long. The way they discuss issues really gives you an inside look to how their creative minds work and why the humor of the show is what it is.

I'm happy to see the show hold onto the quality it built up to in previous seasons and perfected in season eleven, despite some slower episodes this season is just as smart overall and certainly as funny. This show has held up where other animated series have fallen apart or gone astray. I often worry that this show may follow the same path but after listening to Matt and Trey's awareness of themselves I don't believe they would let that happen, at least not to the same extent. 

One of my favorite moments of the season was the boys watching high school musical to see what the hype was about and Cartman's reaction: 
"Well, I'm out guys. If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends."

The Farouk CHI ceramic iron is wonderful! I have really thick hair and it would normally take so long to straighten my hair that I would just leave it slightly curly and frizzy.

ABOUT MY OLD TRIMMER

I used to use a rather inexpensive battery operated nose/ear hair trimmer.  It was really underpowered -- the rotary blade would get stuck easily, and I was lucky just to get the blessed thing to turn on.  Plus, I did not like having to deal with YABOD -- Yet Another Battery Operated Device.  If it runs on batteries, they either have to be charged or replaced, and that's a nuisance -- the more YABODs you have, the bigger a nuisance it is.  I've gone through a lot of cheap electric trimmers in my time (mostly for beards), and they just don't last.


ABOUT MY NEW TRIMMER

I was attracted to Groom Mate's Platinum XL because it is battery-free (not YABOD!) and manually powered (thus never underpowered).  The quality of this item is superb -- it looks and feels absolutely indestructible.  It comes with a lifetime warranty, and it's easy to see why:  This thing will never break or wear out.


TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO

If you're accustomed to a battery-operated trimmer, working a two-handed manual trimmer does take a little getting used to.  I have to admit that the first time I tried it, I thought it didn't work.  I realized that it DID work when I saw all the little hairs in the sink after I rinsed it out, and (forgive me if this seems gross) all the little hairs in a tissue after I blew my nose.  (I always blow my nose after trimming so that I don't inhale loose hairs.)


TRY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT

Once I realized that the Platinum XL does in fact work, I really went to town on the ol' nostrils.  It used to be an unruly jungle up there.  Now, my nostrils are a thing of beauty!  :-)  Actually, two things of beauty, if you want to get technical about it.

Best of all, after using this product, I literally breathe easier!  Thanks to an unimpeded flow of air, my brain is getting more oxygen.  Now my brain can run faster, jump higher, and solve difficult math problems without even breaking a sweat.  

Yes, this one product is going change my whole life.  Well, not really -- but at least I'll look well-groomed while I'm living it.  Plus, I've reduced my YABOD count by one.  Sometimes, less really is more!

First, I'm not a gamer.  I enjoy a good FPS but generally get pwned by kids 30 years younger than me.  I didn't buy this keyboard for it's gaming features.  I needed to replace my Logitech MX5000 BT keyboard because it was driving me crazy with it's connection issues.  The criteria I had for the replacement was that it be wired (I've tried too many flaky wireless solutions); that it preferably have laptop style keys; that it be relatively quiet (so my wife can sleep in the next room); and that the keys have a switchable backlight (more on that later).  The Lycosa met these requirements for me. 

The keyboard itself is really nice looking, not too big, and very low profile.  The high gloss body finish does show finger prints and dust.  The keys have a matte rubber finish that feels good under the finger tips.

I'm almost a touch typist and I have been intrigued by the Das Keyboard II but I just wasn't really ready to commit to a completely unmarked keyboard.  The Lycosa is actually a nice compromise in this regard because I can turn off the backlight completely and have a virtually unmarked keyboard.  

Speaking of backlighting, it is true that the backlighting for the keyboard it somewhat dim, especially when viewed from a slightly slouched seating position.  If you are not very familiar with the standard keyboard layout and you like to slouch when surfing or gaming, then this is probably not the keyboard for you.  However, when sitting in a normal typing position the lighting is perfectly adequate even in a well lit room.  I do understand the desire to want to control the brightness of the backlight.  Maybe that can be supported through a driver or firmware update at some point in the future.  It is interesting to note that when the keyboard backlight is in "WASD" mode, that the lit WASD keys are significantly brighter than normal full keyboard backlight mode.

I want to mention that I continue to use my Logitech MX1000 BT mouse and that I have the BT receiver for the mouse plugged into the USB port on the back of the Lycosa and it is working well.

The Lycosa will not be the right keyboard for everyone.  If you need to be able to see you keys all the time, look elsewhere.  If your a confdent typist and are looking for a nicely designed, high cool-factor, keyboard, then this one is worth considering.

Other keyboards I considered:

Razer Tarantula: Didn't like the industrial design as much and only the side keys were illuminated.  Did like the photo-editing keys on the left side (I'm a photoshop user).  Didn't have laptop style keys.

Saitek Eclipse: Popular keyboard. Terrible design IMHO. Ugh.

Saitek Eclipse II: Well reviewed.  Only slighty better ID than the Eclipse.  Backlight was too ambient making keys harder to identify.  Keys felt a bit smaller than I'm used too when I was playing with one.

Das Keyboard II: Very high quality, totally unmarked keyboard.  I might have to get one someday just for the pure novelty.

Logitech DiNovo Edge: Really nice looking and well reviewed. Nice laptop style keys.  Not wired.  Very expensive.  Too expensive.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot, it's expensive.

I intentionaly steered clear of the Microsoft and Logitech herds of keyboards because that's what I've used for the last 20-some years and and I've never had one I truly liked.  In fact the last keyboard that I truly enjoyed using was the original model-m keyboard that came with my original IBM PC in 1983.  These are still made today, but did not meet my "quiet" requirement.

TurboTax Deluxe Federal + State + eFile 2008TurboTax is still the best tax program to use for your taxes!!! You can do 5 Federal taxes and e-file for free. This version lets you download your state for free, but be aware they don't let you e-file state for free, but you can print it out and mail it in...that's not as good as "free" but is doable!!!!!!!!

The only strong point about the Flip is the convenience of one-button operation. Agreed, the picture quality is nowhere close to the real camcorders that cost twice or thrice as much.  However, there are some other brands of such convenient toy-like camera in the same league as Flip, example, the RCA small wonder, the Aiptek, Mustek, etc. Compared with these in the same league with similar picture quality, Flip is way over-priced.

The RCA small wonder and Flip are made with the same technology, but RCA EZ201 has more features and yet sells for $50 less than Flip Ultra.

I bought both the RCA small wonder EZ201 for $100 and Flip Utra for $150 last week.  Their picture quality are similar.  Yet RCA can run 4 hrs at HQ on 2GB while Flip runs only 1 hour on 2GB, albeit a reviewer claimed he got 2 hrs on the 2GB Flip when he inadvertently left it on.

The small wonder has the added advantage of rewind and fast-forward during playback.  Its LCD can be flipped back, useful for shooting video with yourself in.  Also playback on RCA EZ201 is much louder than the whisper from Flip Ultra.  The RCA has SD slot which is useful travelling without a laptop, and you can just slide in another SD, rather than lugging a laptop to empty out the videos from Flip in order to shoot more.

In summary, Flip Ultra is good but RCA EZ201 has more features and is $50 cheaper than Flip.  Also, Aiptek DV5900 now sells at only $60 at CC and has more features.  Check out their video quality from youtube.

I'm a serious gaming fool and was dismayed to see the New G15 board had reduced the number of programable keys from 18 to 6 as opposed to the "old" G15  The programable keys are the heart of the board, able to record macros as well as any key action.  I am happy again to see that the G11 is the "old" G15, with all 18 keys intact.  To me, the New G15 only offers eye candy at the cost of the best advantage the G11 ( and the Old G15) have, the number of keys to program.  Apparently Logitech saw the  error of it's ways and is keeping the old board alive under a new name.  My guess is that the New G15 will fade away and the G11 will live on.

I'll start out this review by saying that I'm not that familiar with Joss Whedon and his work.

I'll follow up that statement with this:  This DVD makes me want to see more of what he's done.

"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog" is fantastic.  I missed this thing when it was a big deal on the internet months ago, but last month I caught it online after hearing non-stop praise for it, and immediately after it finished, I ordered the DVD.

Simply put, its great.  And that's coming from a guy who really really doesn't like musicals.  

After hearing that it was a musical about a super hero/villian love triangle I half expected some ridiculous, ultra-campy cult thing like The Rocky Horror Picture Show or that REPO! Genetic Opera thing, but I was very relieved to find this project to be very normal and accessible despite how weird that description makes it all sound.

But I won't waste your time with plot, all you need to know is that its wonderfully acted (the subtle touches in NPHs performance are just brilliant), the songs are very good (again, this is made more significant coming from a man who really doesn't like musicals), and its SO INCREDIBLY FUNNY ("We do the weird stuff!")!!!  I've seen this 4 times in the last week and every single time through I find myself catching something I missed before.  Most of those times I was playing it for friends and every one of them enjoyed it to the point of laughing out loud as well.  And that includes people from ages 19-52, all busting a gut over this DVD.

Some might not like the ending, but I found myself reacting to it the same way I did to the ending of "Cloverfield" meaning that when you take a bit of time to consider what all leads up to it, the ending really makes a lot of sense, and it certainly isn't "the wrong way to end it" even if it isn't the finale you were probably expecting.  In fact, I'd say its a great ending.

All in all, its a fantastic DVD, and one that I'm happy to own even if you can see this online for free.  Give it a chance (why not? it IS free online), you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Import works great with the latest version of iMovie on a Mac.  Transfers are fast thanks the hard drive. Editing and transfer to other formats (AppleTV) are very convenient but then my Mac is very fast.  I was nervous going with the hard drive over tape but the convenience of it easily offsets any quality loss for the type of recording I'm doing (family and personal).  Menus are intuitive and the scroll wheel approach works pretty well (it could be better, but I do prefer it over a joystick).   USB 2.0 seems plenty snappy - not missing the firewire.  

The hard drive makes it very easy to get out and shoot - no worry about if you are overwriting a keeper tape or if you are going to run out of tape.  Its also extremely easy to delete unwanted footage in the field right when you've captured it.   This is such a pain on tape that I never do it which results in a lot of wasted time later.

Drive is completely silent.   Shoe provides for a shotgun mic which I'll be trying out shortly.  Headphone jacks for monitoring sound are there and I've found that to be very important on past units.  Construction is solid.  Automatic lens cover much easier than having one on a lanyard that you always have to stow.   Stand by mode gets you shooting in 1 second which is very nice.

Looking forward to trying the still capability.  While the resolution can't match my pocket cam the 10x optical zoom is very nice to have.

On a Mac with the latest iLife and Leopard no software is needed.   Drive mounts on the desktop.  Movies automatically import into the new iMovie.    Absolutely wonderful.

I love my new 600 Series mixer having smoked 2 of the Kitchenaid "heavy duty" models in the past.  I was regretting giving away the harvest gold,  one that needed some work until this one arrived!  The first "heavy duty" mixer got overused grinding meat, the second died of an overdose of Christmas cookie dough.  

I mixed up a small batch of pizza dough the other night and the spiral dough hook is a drastically better design, much less bowl scraping and the dough came together in no time.  Having read the reviews I was still unprepared for how loud the machine is, but it works like a charm!  I love the bigger bowl, and the absence of the spring on the beater holder, no more pinched fingers and struggling to get wayward food out of the spring.

I have been very pleased with both the promotional offers and overall service from Amazon.com.  Amazon has the lowest Pampers prices on the net when you consider the $30.00 to use toward a future diaper purchase as well as their prompt shipping practices.  My three cases of diapers were shipped free to my doorstep within five days of the order placement.  
Prior to using Pampers Cruisers we used Huggies Supreme with our active toddler but we decided that Pampers were far better for us in the end because they are less bulky and the tabs stay attached much better.  Further, a simple call to pampers for defective diapers renders generous coupons as they stand behind their product.  In sum, you get a good value from a good company.

I was skeptical at first about ordering the 1" Chi flat-iron. I have tried many cheaper models in the past, and all of them have done a very mediocre job. My hair is extremely frizzy by nature, so I had all but given up on the aspect of ever wearing my hair straight. Friends told me about the Chi, and how much better it is on their hair, so I finally cut the purse strings and ordered one. I couldn't be happier with it. I get compliments on how nice my hair looks every time I wear it straight. My Chi doesn't leave my hair looking like it's been straightened, rather it makes it look as though it has always been straight. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a good flat-iron.

I bought this for my husband for Christmas because he travels a lot for work and misses all the shows we watch.  He LOVES it.  He is a very technical person and said it was one of the easiest pieces of equipment he has ever set up.  He has used it both domestically and internationally it and works beautifully.  I even find myself using on my computer when I want to sneak in some uninterrupted TV viewing where I don't have a TV.  And it is very, very easy to use.

I've had this for around a month.

Pros:
-its Sandisk, so you know its coming from a reliable manufacturer
-the size is perfect for transfering files, specially avi movies and large quantity of mp3
-the speed, its seems to be about 30% faster than my cruzer mini (but what would you expect, copying things to 4gb instead of 1gb its goint to take some time!)
I like the color scheme, its not golden as the pictures tell it, I mean if you strech your arm out, it seems to be golden, but when you have it in front of you, its like dark gray with metallic
-The retractable usb arm seems to have a nice tight fit

Cons:
-OK, the little key ring that came attached, it doesn't seem strong enough
-The speed, I did some tests copying 970mb of data to both: the sand cruzer micro and this titanium, and to be honest, I didn't saw too much of a difference, but it could be me, who knows.

Other thoughts:
-Its suppose to stand a lot punishement, now, I've accidentally dropped it a couple of times, and its ok, but I'm not goint to roll my car over it
-I like how much it weights
-To give you an idea on the tranfer speeds, it took me about 13 and a half minutes to copy from my PC to the titanium 3.7gb of data and vice versa it took around 4 and a half minutes
-And about deleting files, its like the other sandisk flash drive, its fast

I bought this about a week ago and couldn't be happier with my purchase. I found a great deal that included a year's worth of filters, a 3-brush cleaning kit and a waterproof mat. My 6 cats ranging from 1 year to 12 years old love the fountain. My cats took to it right away, no problems whatsoever. There is a slight hummmmmm that comes from the motor, but nothing that really ticks me off. It kinda sounds like a fish tank motor or one of those old electric clocks at school. I was also amazed at the ease of cleaning. I just followed the detailed pictures and instructions and quickly took the fountain apart (in about 4 or 5 pieces) and completely cleaned the hair and cat food out of it. (I have since moved the fountain away from the food!!) I am tickled that my cats drink better water than I do!!!!

It is refreshing to see a company that doesn't mind shipping its products to APO addresses.  I have been very frustrated being stationed here in Iraq and other posts around the world when trying to order the things that I need from such websites as Amazon.com.  Most online stores feel it is very risky to ship to such addresses or charge such a high shipping rate that it discourages you from even doing business with them.
This is not the case with PHR Systems.  I ordered my Groom Mate nose hair trimmer and within 7 days it arrived at my base here in Iraq.  Fantastic service and the shipping was free!

The Groom Mate Platinum XL nose hair trimmer is my first battery-free trimmer.  My old Panasonic started sucking up the batteries and was starting to pull out my nose hairs which for some reason seem to grow even more quickly in this arid climate.  So, I decided to give the Platinum XL a try.  The best thing about it is that it is so compact that I can carry it with me and I don't even know that it is there.
It works perfectly and as a matter of fact it does such a good job and is so easy to use that I don't even have to use a mirror when trimming my nose hairs.

I like this trimmer so much that I have recommended it to all of my buddies here.  Great job.

There are plenty of very good, very thorough reviews already, so I'm just going to add a couple of specific notes.

It's a small thing, but I wish more dvds provided complete closed captioning.  While the director's commentary of the wide-screen Wall-E is closed captioned (and I applaud them for doing that), things like the deleted scenes still aren't.

Also, it would have been nice to have some variety in the captains' gender or ethnicity. Sadly, all the captain photos are of white guys.  It may seem to be an inconsequential thing, but the aggregate of inconsequential things makes it clear that there is still a lot of subtle discrimination occurring in our world.  I look forward to the day where the only place you can find a collection of only white guys is in history books.

This machine is sturdy.  I also own the Gaggia but this machine has less plastic than the Gaggia.  Both make a great capuccino but the Lello is better in terms of clean up and the water canister allows for more water.

The Gaggia water canister is difficult to remove but the Lello is easier to remove and fill.  You really can't go wrong with either machine but the Lello was close to $100 cheaper.

This is a good heart rate monitor for the money. I can't imagine that one of those $100+ models would perform any better than this one. I really like how it comes with a rubber mounting piece so you can attach it to your treadmill instead of wearing it. Makes it really versatile. My only complaint is that the strap is already on it's smallest setting when I wear it and I plan on losing another 10 pounds. I'm not sure how I'm going to make it fit when I get a little smaller (and I'm not that thin, trust me). Right now I tuck it up under my sports bra to make it stay in place. Hopefully that will continue to work!

I've tried waxing, sugaring, and products that promised slow hair growth over the years to reduce and/or get rid of unwanted leg hair. I first got the $19.95 'touch up' epilator from Target to see if I could handle the epilator pain.  Seeing as it wasn't too bad I decided to try this one and I absolutely love it.  For minimum pain, first let your hair grow for a few days and then try this epilator with the roller attachment. It has a way of vibrating against your skin so you don't feel the hair removal as much.  Then use the attachment that is bare on one side to get a closer shave.  After, take an epsom salt bath to reduce the ingrown hair possibility.  I used the epilator for a couple of days in a row, then waited a few days and did it again.  Doing it a few times within a week was the way to get most of the hairs since they grow at different rates.  I have to honestly say I haven't worked up to doing underarms yet- don't know if I could handle that pain.

I love this story.  Way better than what came out in the movie.  The only problem I have is that it's too expensive for what it adds.  The paper cover is a bit flimsy and the content is only marginally better than what can get for $12 or so.

I used this controller without issue on both a Windows and Linux machine and it works great in both environments. Does not feel cheap in the hands and seems pretty sturdy. My only complaint is with the D-pad; the buttons are set higher making it a little funny to work with and the buttons are loud.

I have a rather out of control 73 lbs Dalmation/Pit Bull and much to my amazement this actually works!!!  I do need to keep a close eye on the seat stem tightness vs the Walky Dog attachmennt tightness (initially she could twist my seat around as my seat stem was not tight enough). 

With the Walky Dog I can get pulled around the block and have even prevented altercations with many dogs along the way.

Thank you for an alternative from being pulled at over 20 MPH on rollerblades!!! (Don't ask.)

There is nothing that compares. At first I thought it was too expensive and bought one of the other logitech wheels because it was cheaper. Then I ordered the G25 to compare. The other wheel was good, but no comparison and was returned the same day. The feedback is right on. The wheel feels more solid than the lower logitechs. The peddles have better pressure and the added clutch is a must. The separate gear shift is nice if you don't always want to use it, but if you do, you have the option of regular or sequential shifting. The shifter also adds more macro buttons for less fiddling with the keyboard. I believe it's the best you can get for a home system.

This dog rake is the best I have ever used. My dog is a Chow Chow, so lots of thick winter undercoat needed to come out.  I get lots more hair in much less time.  I had broken my arm, so I didn't have the strength to comb my dog this spring.  The groomer suggested I get the Furminator. WOW! It was so much easier.  This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone with a dog that has a thick undercoat.

I know that some folks didn't like this coffee maker for one reason or another. I have to tell you that mine makes OUTSTANDING coffee!

I consider myself to be somewhat of a coffee snob. If you like coffee from a can [sic] then you will be wasting your time and money with a coffee maker like this one. On the other hand, if you buy your coffee from a local coffee roaster or any chain retailer of premium beans (like Starbuck's, et. al.), you will be glad you considered this coffee maker.

I make a 6 cup pot every morning -which ends up being  about 3 real mugs of coffee. I pour in 1 liter of water from a plastic bottle I refill every morning.

I had a Krups Duo Filter model for many years and it started to leak. Initially I replaced it with a cheap GE coffee maker from a large super-store based in Arkansas. What a piece of garbage. It made the worst coffee I've ever had. I put up with that for about a month, and I am sorry I did.

Then I decided to do some research (on Amazon, and other sites). I'm glad I did. End result: great cup of coffee. Every time. Bravo.

2/27/2009:

I've read all the reviews here. They're pretty scary, aren't they? And while I believe these reviews are accurate for those folks, I personally have NO problems with this software, AT ALL.

I did what others said, I downloaded the trial. It not only imported my old QB files perfectly, it also imported my accountant's PC back up of my file. Both were perfect.

Some items that I noticed were complained about most by others:
Email PDF - works PERFECTLY.
Template designer - GREAT!
Online banking imports? Also PERFECT.

Honestly, this is the best looking and best functioning version of the software yet. I love it. I was *this* close to getting MYOB after reading the reviews of QB here, but, after downloading their trial I wasn't too impressed with their interface. I much prefer the new QB interface (while it's really only the "home" area that is different looking, it still makes a difference to my user experience as a visual/creative person).

And no, I am not being paid to write this review, lol. I really just am SOOOO relieved after reading all these horrid reviews that actually does work, and quite well.

I am coming from QB 2006 for Mac. Version I had before that was QB6. So it's been a while since I upgraded, and this was was worth the wait. All of those other versions worked great, no crashing, but my QB 6 or 2006 didn't do Email PDF for a while, but, when I upgraded the OS at one point years back it did end up working eventually. But basically those versions never gave me problems either.

If you are wondering I am on a first generation MacBookPro running 10.5.6 with 2 gigs of ram/memory. 
(I think ALL negative reviewers should explain what systems they are using, as that will most likely be the culprit of some issues, I'll bet).

That said, I am sure their tech support stinks royally. And hopefully I will never have to call them! ;)

The camera comes with everything you'll need, including all the software for your computer.  Deffinately recommended for people with kids and those people who aren't very good with technology because it's so easy.

I am not usually an early adopter, but boy am I glad I bought this when I did.  I had major issues with my landline provider when I tried to move my service, and the shock waves that hit my poor cellphone bill with its bare minimum monthly plan devastated my budget.

Two months with my Ooma, and the shockwaves are over.  And the thing has already paid for itself.  (Startling how quickly a cellphone overage adds up at 40 cents a minute.)

The packaging is exquisite.  The hub and scout are well-fitted with easy to decipher buttons that work in the dark.  And set up was a total breeze.  

I had a question.  It was answered online immediately.  The customer service is fast, knowledgeable, and very polite.

Call quality is excellent.  Crystal clear, no echoes, no tin can, no delay.  As good as my old landline.

Voicemail and the other bundled features work flawlessly.  The only thing I wish it had is call blocking.  Maybe it does, and I haven't figured out how to use it.  Seriously.  There just is no downside to this device if you are already paying for broadband internet service.

Dexter is truly a dark comedy - what's not to love. You have a traditional bad guy taking out the really bad guys there by cleaning up his little corner of the world. This series for me had those "bust out laughing" moments. I've bought and watched season one and two several times and I can't wait for season three to hit DVD. I recomend Dexter for any mature audience. Funny series great cast - Michael C Hall nails it.

This is a good choice for those who are in the market for a good, basic, and cheap Laptop. I highly recommend this Laptop for websurfing, and all your Office applications. If you want more than that you will be disappointed. Keep in mind that this is a single core low energy Intel processor. As for the hard drive and RAM they put plenty in this small case so that helps the overall performance.

The exterior looks nice and shiny. Keyboard is not that small, Unfortunately the display is kind of small, I think they wasted too much space in the frame. 

Battery life is very good, I get 3 to 4 hours on normal settings.

I purchase two of this Laptops one for me and one for my niece. She's 12YO and she use it for school as a replacement for her paper notebook. She's very please with this little thing. I use mine as a traveler replacement for my new HP DV51010US compare to that the Acer is no more than a toy, but is much lighter and the battery life is way better too. So I rather carry this around when I'm away.

This is one of the recommended models in Consumer Reports last coffee review. I agree.  It's the cleanest, easiest, and fastest design I've seen in a long time.  Carafe is drip free and the filter basket is a simple easy to use/clean design.  My only quibble is that the brewing process is just a notch below the best coffeemaker (Braun KF400). I had the Braun but got fed up with it's drippy carafe and quirky filter basket. 

If you have little time in the morning to fight with your coffeemaker and don't want to waste a lot of time wiping up spilled coffee, this is the coffeemaker for you.  I'm a cream and sugar type so the brew quality is good enough for me.

Nice value for the money.  Very small size...which will easily fit in a shirt pocket.  2GB on board memory which easily holds 60 minutes of video.  All software is included in the 2GB of onboard memory so no software on CDs to load.  Only downside is that resolution when using the zoom blurs a little...but video is very clear when not using the zoom.  Extremely easy to use.

We like this gate but it is hard for the bigger kids to get through.   We have had it over a month and our 4 year old (a thin 32 pounder) can only get through it about 1 in 10 times - she gets on the peddle and jumps up and down but has trouble coordinating her landing with a pull or push to get it open.  Our five year old, weighing in the 40s, has mild difficulty only about 1 in 10 times.   All the neighborhood kids their age have trouble with it and each one seems to glee in slamming it shut after they go through so I spend quite a bit of time as gate monitor.  I have taken to telling kids to go around outside.  When kids have trouble with it they all end up yanking at it which is tearing up the walls - I wish it was hard mounted.    A couple times I have hurt the baby's foot letting it get caught as I went through the narrow opening with him on my hip.  I would still choose this gate over all the others we looked at.  I wish I had had it when the others were young!

For the money this is a great product. I recently used it kayaking, white water rafting, on zip lines through trees, on jet skis and filming the kids body surfing. The challenge isn't the quality of the video but rather your ability to keep the camera steady!!! I used the included silicone grease and water was not an issue... One thing you need to practice with is camera alignment. I found at first I was shooting too high...That was easy to correct but the absence of wires make this worth the money...

My keyboard arrived today and I'm in love with it. I'm not a gamer and didn't buy it for games, but for work-related tasks. The G keys are amazingly easy to program for a macros-newbie. The only problem is remembering what key you programmed for what, but I suppose it will come with time. For my purposes, I've programmed text and formatting, something I wasn't quite sure the G15 would handle when I ordered it. Thank God it does. The macros can pretty much handle entire paragraphs if you enter them properly. 

Like other reviews say, the LCD screen is pretty pointless (like I said, I don't play games so perhaps it benefits gamers more). The G11 is coming out soon so you may want to wait for that (the same model as the G15 without the LCD screen). So far the only advantage I've found is that it automatically reads my itunes and you can check a song's progress even if iTunes is hidden on your desktop.

The backlit keys are very sexy. However, the downside is that I feel the keys are cramped and small. I'm switching from the standard Microsoft ergonomic board, so it's taking some time to get used to the layout. If you're currently using a non-ergonomic keyboard, then I'm sure the switch would be seamless. Ideally, I'd like an ergonomic keypad but hey, this keyboard wasn't made for typers. In a perfect world, this would also be bluetooth wireless, but you can't win them all. 

All in all, another great product from Logitech, from a work-tasker's point of view, not a gamer. Anyone can benefit from this keyboard, if they want to launch applications or websites with a single keystroke.

Although I agree that it IS a bit irritating that all the characters get exactly what they want, don't you think most of you are being a bit hard on the book? I mean...Fictional stories are supposed to be able to take you outside of your reality and put you into a world where anything can happen. That's the fun of Fiction, you can escape your life for another, more unrealistic one. Yes, Bella did get pregnant at 18, but I'm 17 and it doesn't make me feel like it's "okay" to get pregnant right now. I think we fans should be more mature than that and honestly? I think we ARE more mature than that. We aren't idiots. And the issue about Jacob imprinting on the baby? Wasn't that written about in the previous books? That a werewolf could imprint on even an infant and the feelings toward it aren't sexual; they just want the child to be happy and healthy. I don't think it's that weird, it's actually understandable. He imprinted on a child from the girl he loved. I get it and it's not as "creepy" as people make it seem. Anyway... no matter how many 1 star reviews the books gets, I love the Twilight series and I still give Breaking Dawn 4 stars.

This is the perfect HRM for anyone just trying to monitor their heart rate.  Directions for set up are very easy.  The price for this HRM is pretty cheap compared to others. Comes in a great storage zipper bag.  If you need something with more features like calorie counting, average heart rate, etc. then you need to looke elsewhere. Now that I can keep track of my target zone for weight loss I have lost 10 pounds in one month. Seems like I was not working hard enough.  The alarms are really great and let you know if you are not working out hard enough or workin out too hard.   I have purchased two already for myself and girlfriend and both work properly and they do not seem to obstruct with each other. Great buy for beginner or advanced.

After discovering how much "bad" sugar is in ALL store bought bread that costs less than $5 a loaf, we decided to make all of our bread at home.

I bought this machine to replace a BreadMan that I got from my mom whose paddle post had completely worn out and would not knead anymore, so all we were getting was short loaves with the paddle hiding somewhere in the end of the bread. This is our third bread machine and we use it at least twice a week.

Overall, I have been very pleased with this machine. 5 out of 6 loaves turn out perfect, with the 6th just being a little on the short side. After experimenting with it, I have decided not to use the automatic yeast dispenser because I get better results when I don't. There is, of course, no way to turn this feature off, it still tries to dump in the yeast, but that's not really a big deal.

I have two main complaints about this machine. The first is the lack of crust control on everything but white. If you're anything like our family, my husband and my daughter do not like crust, so I would really like to be able to make a light crust on my wheat bread. This machine just doesn't have that option, which you can't really tell from looking at the specs.
The second complaint is that it tends to be very touchy. If you don't measure out your ingredients *VERY* carefully, and you peek at your bread "just to see how it's doing", you'll get a midget loaf. (Yes, peeking is a bad habit of mine, which is why I like the timer function) It still tastes great, and it's still mixed well, which is the problem I've had with other bread machines, but it's rather dense and doesn't make for good sandwiches. 

All that said, I would still recommend this bread machine. I like the horizontal pan better than the vertical. I like the size options, 2 ?- 2 - 1 ?pound options. It's extremely easy to clean. The timer function works great. And the overall control features are pretty good.  I mostly make a few recipes that I've had for a long time, so I don't know how it handles specialty breads, but it does splendidly on pizza dough.

If you're looking for a solid bread machine, look no further. Given the price, reliability, and functionality, it's a great machine.

Just brewed my 1st cup of coffee with the Brew Central DCC-1200.Before my purchase through Amazon I read all 58 reviews of this product and was concerned about the 50-50 division of opinion on the quality of the brew, whether it was hot enough (I need it hot), and the water mess on the counter when the cover was raised.  I should add that I recently purchased and returned a Krups (great coffee but a clunker for endurance--froze up twice after a few months operation) and Capresso (dull, undrinkable coffee).My empiracle assessment of the DCC-1200 is that:1. The brew is superior;2. It is hot--can't see how it could be hotter;3. A plastic lip connected to the reservoir cover on the back of the machine catches any condensation runoff when the cover is raised.

Like the other books in the saga, I could NOT put this book down. It went everywhere with me so that I could sneak in a page here or there.
First of all, two things happened in this book that I didn't think were ever going to happen. One, that Bella and Edward...umm...hooked up. The books are geared towards YA, so I wasn't sure what was going to happen there. Of course, they were married (hm, something else I didn't think would actually end up happening), so it's all good, but I didn't think we'd get to read about it at all. Second, I never actually thought Edward would turn Bella. He had been so adament all along that she remain human. I'm still not sure how I feel about that. Even though Edward explained why he liked her better as a vampire, I can't help but feel that he fell in love with her as a human. He loved so many of her human aspects, and that what was so neat about their relationship. I especially hated that she was stronger than him. Hmph. In the previous books, I always loved how he had to protect here. Suddenly, she's stronger. But I did enjoy some aspects of her becoming a vampire. Made for fun and sometimes humorous reading.
Edward's suffering (and even Jacob's) was so devastating. I cried just reading about how much they were suffering when Bella was dying. Very moving and stressful. 
I think my gasp could have been heard across state lines when Jacob imprinted on the baby. What a great plot twist AND very appropriate. I still can't get over that one!!!! I do hope they have their own book or SOMETHING, but I don't see that happening.
Now, about the end. I was fascinated by the fight preps. All of that was riveting, especially since "average" Bella was now their secret weapon. I was kind of bummed that there was never actually the big fight. Sure, they were attacked, but it wasn't much, and Bella's shield kept them all from harm. I was looking forward to the big fight and how they would all use their special skills to defend their family. I was expecting some to die in the fight, and was freaking out wondering who that might be, but still looking forward to the action. I was disappointed that that didn't happen and stressed out knowing that they'd be back...eventually...but without a book! 
I would have liked an epilogue further into the future...like years!
Overall, though, I loved this book! It was my favorite of the 4.

By the way, these negative reviews are freaky. People talking about book-burnings????? Joking or no, that's really scary! Other people are talking about confronting her if they see her in public...again, joking or no, that's really scary. If you're taking a YA book about vampires this seriously, then you're not mature enough to read fictional novels. Seriously, people, chill out. You've had to suspend your disbelief for 3 large tomes already...now it's suddenly too unbelievable??? Sheesh, give me a break. It's time for school to start back up, since I'm thinking some people have too much time on their hands if they're throwing hissy fits over a fictional book. Ugh.

I have no previous video camera, with the exception of my Canon Powershot Elf SD200 video capture. My still camera could take video, but it was grainy and the audio wasn't that great. I was looking for a better video camera for cheap for casual use. This hit the sweet spot. Simple interface, anyone can use. Software is part of the camera, so no separate CD to install. You don't even need to use the software to get the videos. Playback is great and instantaneous. Slightly smaller than a video iPod and lighter.

If you are looking to take casual videos on the fly, this is your camera. If you are looking to capture those "precious moments" then it may not be enough "high-end" quality that you might want. Pocket camera this is. Wedding camera, baby first steps, etc. this camera might not be for you.

Best value for dollar out there for video cameras this small. Just don't expect anything more than point and shoot.

I purchased a couple of items through their store on Amazon.com and had them delivered to my default address which Amazon has on file for me.  I realized a day later that I had used the incorrect address (my fault) and quickly contacted PHR.  Well, it turns out that they shipped my order the same day that I placed it and they used the wrong address (again, my fault).  Without any hesitation on their part they used the new address that I provided to them and even shipped my order to me via priority mail.  I received my order 4 full days before the earliest date that Amazon provided to me!  Absolutely incredible.  I am not even sure if they ever got the first shipment back or not!  This is exactly how customer service used to be in the old days and should be now... 5 STARS!

And now for the trimmer.  I wasn't sure what to expect as far as my new Platinum XL trimmer was concerned but based on lots of research and reviews that I have read here I thought that for less than $20 and free delivery that I wasn't going to go wrong.  And boy, was I right.
This little trimmer does a wonderful job of very easily trimming unwanted hair.  I read a couple of reviews that complained that it doesn't trim the hairs short enough but according to everything that I have read you really do need to have nose hair to keep foreign matter from getting into your breathing passage and lungs.  I found that with a little practive I was able to trim my nostril hairs as short as I want and without cutting the inside of my nose.  This really is a very ingenious device and very well made.  The lifetime warranty is a great plus mainly because I think that it shows that the company is willing to stand behind their product unlike a lot of companys and products that are on the market today.

Kudos to PHR Systems and the Platinum XL nose hair trimmer.  5 Stars all the way!!!

Ever since I saw "How It's Made" on TV several weeks ago featuring the the building of the Braun Pulsonic, I've wanted one. But, like many, the price was daunting. For a very long time I have preferred my electric (Norelco) over a blade because the blade just takes too darn long. I only had to make one concession: the blade shaves closer. Then, just days ago, I "bit the bullet" so to speak, and ordered the Braun. The sheer weight of favorable reviews outweighed the price for me.

To make a long story somewhat shorter, the Braun is like no other shaver on earth. It does, indeed, rival a blade shave, and it does it eons more quickly and comfortably. On top of that, it's built like a fine watch, and has enough bells and whistles to keep even the most jaded user happy.  It is only a small tad "noisier" than my Norelco, but the comparison ends there. The Braun makes the Norelco hang it's shaver head in shame. I find myself wanting to shave more often, but the efficiency of the Braun would mean I would be shaving mostly-bare skin.

If you want the razor of all razors, forget cost and get this one. There's no way in the world that you will end up sorry to did it.

I was looking for a high-quality burr grinder for the Holidays.  Had family in town, so I knew I would be constantly brewing coffee.  The Capresso burr grinder had mixed reviews on some other sites, but I found this product to continue to perform very well, and is less expensive than alternative high-end grinders.  I have no opinion regarding product durability, since it is mostly constructed of plastic and still new, but I run this item every day, sometimes multiple times per day and it just works well.

The coffee grind is consistent, and the various fineness settings make a very significant difference in coffee taste.  You have to experiment a bit to get the right grind fineness for your particular coffee maker.  Once I found the right setting, it has provided the same grind for over a month.

Makes perfect yogurt everytime. I use my own glass jar instead of the plastic one that came with it.The yogurt is perfect consistency , I use boiled raw skimmed milk and the results are much better as compared to pastuerised milk. Before using this yougurt maker I had tried everything, a sweater , a jacket  around the milk in a jar , in the oven and slow cooker to create the right temprature, but nothing worked . This is a perfect simple little device.Once you know your timings,you will find it very easy to use.I will never go back to commercial yougurts sitting in plastic containers,God knows for how long!

Selznick-International was one of the first independent movie studios in the 1930's, which makes &quot;GWTW&quot; one of the earliest and most successful independent films.  Selznick eventually needed help from his Father in-law Louis B. Mayer which explains why MGM had the rights to the film after Selznick went defunct in the 1940's.  &quot;GWTW&quot; is certainly Hollywood's greatest pageant, a feast for the eyes and ears.  Martin Scorcese said that films of old Hollywood still have a way of lighting up that fantasy part of our brains, and he is right.  It's cinematic theatricality at its very best.  The film sags a bit post-intermission, and becomes less dramatic history and more soap opera, but that's what happens when you try to cram a 1000+ page book into a nearly 4 hour film.  The only recent film to come close to &quot;GWTW's&quot; sweep and romance is &quot;Titanic&quot;.The DVD print is good, but the DVD is sorely in need of more extras:  there are no interviews, only one trailer, and no screen tests.  Perhaps a future DVD could contain that great 1990 documentary by Turner, &quot;The Making of GWTW&quot; narrated by Christopher Plummer.

I just purchased the pro yesterday at my local Apple Store.  I have had it for less then 24hrs so far, and I love it.  I was going to get the high end Macbook, and then at the last minute decided on the low end Pro upgraded with 4GB of Memory.  I am so glad I did.  It is so fast, and powerful.  The display is what made me make the final choice.  It is still very portable.  It weighs the same as my black macbook, and is thin.  It would be very easy to just to throw in my backpack and be on my way.  Also the firewire.  It was going to be the easiest way to transfer all my data from my old black macbook to the pro.  It only took and hour and a half, and I have all my information.  I didn't have to do anything, just started it up and began to play.  I didn't have Leopard on my old one, and I love it so far.  It is easy and the graphics and set up are great.  I love the stacks options, and the lighted keyboard.  I also love how the controls for the dashboard, screen brightness, keyboard brightness, and dvd controls, are right on the keyboard.  I was in between which laptop to get also because I am a casual gamer.  However, the salesman did tell me that I could still play some of the games on the Macbook.  The display alone is what I am enjoying the most.  It is definitely worth the extra money to get the pro.  Highly Recommended!
            I didn't get it from Amazon, or order it.  I wanted to look at the computer before I purchased it.  From reading all the horror stories on the web about people receiving damaged, or broken laptops from both the Apple Store and other retail stores.  I would also recommend if you are going to get a mac, go to the Apple Store itself and get one if possible.  They are so helpful, and usually give you some kind of deal when purchasing one.  They will also set it up for you, but transferring all your information to your new computer is very easy to do by yourself.

This review is from: Quantum of Solace [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)

      



Quantum of Solace is an excellent movie.  Daniel Craig, Olga Kurylenko and Judi Dench all are part of a compelling story that started in Casino Royale.  This movie picks up immediately where Royale leaves off.  The story line is tight.  The action is quick and the characters are convincing as "damaged goods" trying to make their way in a crazy and absorbing world of lies, espionage and terrorism.  Some scenes are particularly touching as they show Bond struggling with grieving while not knowing how to grieve.  He sits in flight to South America, unable to sleep; drinking and drinking. You get the sense that he may not sleep, just simply passes out. Obviously a way of life since the death of Vesper.  But Bond does know vengence and spends his time in Quantum chasing down those responsible for Vesper's death while on the job as 007.  Craig is a great Bond.  Possibly the best.  No dishonor to the venerable Connery, of course.  Never the less, Craig has redefined Bond as a character who rises above the cartoon caricature that Bond had become into one who is complex, compelling and edgy.

Does no one make a blender that will last over a year anymore?  Technically, I should wait a year to write this reveiw.  I've had it a few months so far and it's not a bad blender.  I've done smoothies, gazpacho and pesto with no issues.  I like that the mechanics of the blender are metal and that the pitcher is glass.  It's powerful and works well.

It looks good on the counter and works great! My husband and I don't always want the same brew strength and this has solved our problem. Also, I love that I can make a travel mug of tea or coffee, right into the mug. It makes my mornings easy and smooth. Making hot chocolate for the kids is a snap with this too. I hated having to get out some other kettle or dish to heat water for tea or hot chocolate in! This thing gives you really hot water really fast. 

I have been ordering the coffee pods online because there is more variety, but in a pinch, Target sells two kinds of the k-cups.

Great product at a great price. You really can't go wrong with Cuisinart. I got one for myself and my mom. My mom had one for years and years and the only reason I bought her a replacement was because she had lost some of the accessories, nothing was wrong with the motor or anything. The size is great, its compact and fits nicely in my cabinet. I think the size is perfect for your everyday cooking needs. I definitely recommend!!!

I'd give it 10 stars if I could. This device has been a lifesaver for me. I am too much of a chicken to go to a salon; however, with a little trial and error, I've learned to do the epilation everywhere, even on bikini and underarm. My smooth skin gives me so much confidence, and it does not hurt a bit anymore. 

If you are a chicken like me, follow my instructions instead of the manual, provided you are willing to invest a lot of time initially. I said initially, because, after a couple of months, the pain will subside and you'll be able to do it any way you want, while watching TV or lulling your baby to sleep. (Yes, the sound does soothe the baby! Consider that an unadvertized perk.)

So here is how to start.

1) Take a long, hot bath.

2) Shave. If you are persistent, that's the last time you ever will.

3) Use SilkEpil on just shaved skin. Yes, there will be hardly any results, but there won't be any pain either, and your muscles will relax; it's important to get into the habbit or relaxing while epilating, reduces the pain greatly.

4) Repeat next day (except, of course, no shaving). Heck, repeat later same day. You will achieve the results gradually while staying within your comfort zone as far as the pain goes. Do it every day until you feel in control, then gradually reduce the time interval between epilations to up to a month.

5) When you begin feeling pain on one leg, switch to the other. Somehow that reduces the pain.

6) Use long, quick strokes until you are comfortable.

7) Holding the device so that it rotates in the direction of the hair growth makes the process much more gentle on you and more time cosuming.

8) If you feel like giving up at any point, remember the 2nd epilation will be nothing like the first; the 3rd will be a breeze. 

Good luck!

As for the product, my only wish is that it was cordless.

I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PERSONS TO BUY A BREADMACHINE IN 1980.  AT THAT TIME, NO ONE I KNEW HAD EVEN HEARD OF ONE.  WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL SINCE - 8-10?).  SINCE THE DAY THE FIRST MACHINE ARRIVED, WE HAVE VERY RARELY EATEN BREAD OTHER THAN WHAT I MAKE.

This mixer complements my KitchenAid Heavy duty mixer quite nicely, being highly suited to quick, light-duty operations.  

It is quite loud, but not noticeably more than any other hand mixer I have used, and quieter than many. The "soft start" works well, but seems to build to about speed 3 before slowing back down to speed 1 before I select a speed. 

The LED speed indicator is very clear and the range of the 7 speeds is more than adequate. If you hand-wash them, unlike the beaters of older hand mixers, its beaters are easy to clean because they do not have a centre-post.

I cannot imagine wanting to knead dough - or any heavy mixture - with a hand mixer. That task is reserved for the KitcheAid. This mixer has met my requirements fully over the last year - and at a decent price. I wonder whether it will last as long as the one I still have that has been used for well over 30 years? - It still (but barely) works.

I've had a Zo for 9 years and wanted to upgrade to this machine for a few years.  I finally took the plunge and upgraded to this new machine because I wanted the sourdough cycle.  I made a couple loaves of bread so far and they've all come out beautifully.  They are kind of 'crusty' but I brush them down with some melted butter and the crust is great.  To be successful with this machine you must measure accurately and keep the machine away from drafts.  This machine works great!

First a little background then a detailed review.  I am a serious casual video user and a more serious amateur still photographer.  I have had two previous camcorders, a full size VHS and then a Sony Digital 8.  Going on vacation for two weeks to the Philippines I decided to get this Canon HG10 after reviewing everything I could find on the Net.  Bottom line, Sony's were too expensive for the same thing.

I had my concerns about going Hard Drive but this thing worked flawlessly whether it be from bumpy automobiles, small boat rides, or walking and banging on my hip (for a few minutes when I accidentally left it on).  And after two weeks of filming on high def setting, I only used 10 of the 40GB. 

I've viewed the HD video two ways; directly connecting the camcorder to my HD TV through the HDMI connections which is the most convenient; and making a HD AVCHD DVD and playing it through a HD DVD player connected again to the HDMI ports.  The video quality is stunning, as true to life as you can get and I appreciated that especially when filming relatives and really beautiful places like the white sand beach and crystal clear waters on Boracay Island).  I've tried viewing via component video set ups and they are not bad either.

I had three batteries and if all I had done was film, I think they would have lasted the entire two weeks but I did a lot of reviewing and playing back which really used up the batteries.   The size of this camera is just right, it fits in a medium sized shoulder bag with all my other things and no one around me would ever suspect I was carrying a camcorder.  It can even fit in a large pants pocket but that would be too conspicuous and then the thieves would notice.  The controls were easy to use and I like the jog wheel on the side of the viewing screen which then stayed clean the entire trip.  Tip: this camcorder fits perfectly inside a quart-size ziplock bag which really helped to keep it protected from dust, sand and water.  
   
A feature I never had before was taking still photos and it performed better than I expected.  I was most impressed with the lack of shutter lag and the brightness of the built in flash.  I didn't miss bringing a digital cam along at all and had so much fun taking video I didn't take all that many stills anyway.  I had it set at the highest setting and didn't come close to filling the 2GB memory card.  

One little quirk,  if the zoom is set to variable setting,  the speed of zooming out is much faster than the speed of zooming in using the same finger pressure for each.  I don't know if this is on purpose or if my camera is set improperly but I can deal with it by either remember this or switch the speed setting to either slow or fast fixed speed instead of variable which is what I did.  I don't like to zoom that much anyway since zooming in and out is often overdone. 

All in all I am very satisifed with this camcorder and my purchase through Amazon.   I hope this camcorder lasts me a long time.  I will never use tape again.

This Netbook, beside its full line of functions, serves me very well for reading books in pdf format with the built-in pdf reader. Since most of my books are classical, out-of-copyright texts, this compact computer offers me access to enormous free libraries: the Google digital collection and those of other libraries. I set up the screen to full-screen view and turn the netbook on its side, thus creating a screen that imitates a book. Then I prop the netbook on a compact book reading stand and read wherever I please. The screen is bright, in color and of very good resolution. This an excellent alternative to the e-book.

Ok, I know this sounds crazy because come on now, this is only a nose hair trimmer...it's not rocket science.  Like a lot of other reviewers here we all seem to have the same problem with battery operated trimmers in that they all seem to either not work at all or pull hair and the blades dull quickly.  Trust me, I've had my fair share of crappy imported battery operated trimmers and they are all now in the land fill.

I received my Platinum XL trimmer a couple of weeks ago and have used it twice so far and it works...period!  Nothing fancy, but a well designed, 
easy to use trimmer that feels really solid.  I was quite surprised to see so many hair clippings in the end where the blades are after just a couple of turns of the blades.

I would like to see a pouch or carring case even though this trimmer is less than 3" in length and I guess that the protective case that comes with it will keep it safe when it is in my travel case.

By the way, the free shipping was a big plus!  Thanks.

This camera is perfect for capturing kids, events and is small enough to carry in your pocket.  The video itself is clear and the built in microphone picks up sound easily. 

After my family saw the videos produced they have bought this camera as well. So, now we have five of them!

This review is from: Lost: The Complete Fourth Season [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)

      



Lost Season 4 finally gave us some answers as to who gets off the island, and some clues as to what the island is all about.  During the first 3 seasons we learned about each character.  Season 4 ties many of these characters together and develops the characters even further.  This series has been pretty incredible since the 1st season.  Watching Lost gives you the feeling you are watching a full length movie rather than a TV series.  The money spent on the set alone (ie. the airplane wreckage) was more than was spent on many other feature movies.  

Lost season 4 leaves you wanting more.  Season 3 was difficult for viewers because it felt sporadic.  There was not a smooth flow week to week and the weekly schedule was affected.  Although there was a writer's strike, Season 4 began and was more consistent week to week.  It is nice that there is finally a plan to end the series with 16 episodes each year trough season 6.  I empathize with another reviewer that it may seem like a rip-off since there are only 16 episodes instead of 24, but I think the episodes are better and there is obviously some inflation over last year  :)  

I own the first 3 seasons season 3 on Blu-ray.  I am excited to get this  season 4 on blu-ray as well.  Satellite and Cable TV HD Programming do not do this series justice.  They are only broadcast in 1080i and are compressed smaller so they can fit the data down the pipeline.  This ultimately degrades the picture significantly.  Blu-ray allows the viewer to view this series in 1080p (Through HDMI) and there is a significant difference in the quality of video and sound.  Plus it is much more fun to watch the series without interruptions and ads on the screen.  I am on the reserve list for this series and as a blu-ray lover, I recommend making the switch to blu-ray, especially with your favorite TV Series LOST!

I bought this product because the alternative would have ended up with two dead beagles and probably me in jail. Installed it facing over the fence, and the ridiculous howling has been reduced to one howl followed by silence until their little brains forget and they howl again. I'd say the improvement is in the area of 70%, plus the added fact that the owner now sees a flashing light which he thinks is some kind of recording device. I had read that the product does not work on deaf dogs, which may explain the (limited) continued howling. Though expensive, this product is worth a huge amount when compared to the cost of disruption caused by people buying dogs because they think they look cool instead of doing research and realizing that beagles are actually disciples of satan.

When I bought my Breville Wok my old stove was down to one working burner.  It definitely gave me more flexibility in cooking and it does a good job but the only heat setting I ever use is the HIGH-SEAR.  The only thing I don't like about an electric wok may be a selling point to some people- it is VERY HEAVY.  I was used to my old wok which was for the stove and was light weight.  I decided to buy a new stove and a new light weight wok.  When I am cooking a smaller amount of food I like to use my light weight wok where I can use a wrist motion to flip the food up in the air and have it land down back in the wok.  You can't do that with the Breville because it is so heavy.  

I still use the Breville particularly when I am cooking a larger amount of food, and have even used it as a make shift deep fryer and it seems well made so it should last a while.  I dump hot water in it after I use it to help keep stains from building up on the non stick finish.  That and using non metal utensils for stirring the food should help the non stick finish last a long time.

I have been using the Senseo pod machine for several years and made my own pods by just placing two scoops of ground coffee in a small basket filter and putting it in the large pod holder. It was my husband that wanted something different as the coffee wasn't strong enough for him. We decided to try the Keurig B60. I wasn't keen on having to buy the Kcups which are plastic but because it does have its own Kcup for my own coffee, I agreed to getting it. 

I have to admit that the Keurig choice of coffees is awesome as well as very good. The coffee from any pods I've tried was horrible! As my husband likes his coffee strong, he is still experimenting with the various bold ones to find his favorite. 

The secret to getting good coffee from the Kcup when you use your own ground coffee, is in the grinding. Either grind the coffee beans as fine as your coffee grinder will go or buy expresso coffee. It's like a powder essentially. Wow, the coffee was so strong on the large setting I couldn't drink it. Of course I don't like my coffee really strong.

Also I like the fact that it's a wonderful hot water dispenser for my own tea bags. I won't pay what Keurig asks for their tea Kcups but I have to admit that their teas are good. A tea bag in my hot water works for me.

One of the things that I like the most is that with the B60, I can now use any of the mugs I have. That was so frustrating with the Senseo. A lot of my mugs were too tall to use in it. The B60 even takes my travel mug which measures 7 inches tall without the lid. To make enough for a large mug, you can do as many ounces as you want by simply opening the lid and closing it again so the numbers flash and start brewing again without changing the Kcup. It might get too weak by putting water through one Kcup more than once but you can do it. With just dispensing water, you can definitely repeat as much as you want by simply opening the lid and closing it again so the numbers flash. I can even fill a teapot if it lines up with the dispenser.

We are pleased with our Keurig B60. Yes, it is relatively expensive but as always, you do get what you pay for. Any good coffee maker is going to cost more. I have the Technivorm Moccamaster for when we want a pot of coffee and it is the best one ever! It took me 25 years to give in to paying the price to get one but I should have done it long ago. For all the coffee makers we've gone through in that time, I could have had one really good one!

The Keurig B60 (I deliberatly measured) delivers an exact if not a smidgen more 6, 8, and 10 oz amount on the various settings. I don't know what the 5.25, 7.25, and 9.25 oz are all about. Now that is with dispensing water. Perhaps after the water goes through the coffee, it does lose a little volume.

We have no complaints so far with the Keurig B60. The price for Kcups on Amazon with auto delivery is the best around. We also like the variety pack we found at Bed, Bath, and Beyond and use the 20% off coupon.

I have enjoyed this bread maker.  I have only used the recipes included with the machine so far, but am going to try some of my own soon.  The two things I was disappointed with is that a half wheat and half white recipe was not included in their recipe book.  And I would like to use alternatives to butter and sugar like oils and honey but these are also not included in their recipes.  Perhaps, when I have owned the machine longer, I will find recipes that are compatible with these alternatives.

Ordered this top of the line Oral-B toothbrush . The online description is very sketchy - there is no way to know what accessories actually come with the toothbrush. Although there were several attachments that come with this toothbrush, there was only ONE toothbrush head.   Looking at the photo of the storage/recharge  unit, it looked like it might come with a couple of brushheads so that more than one person could use the handle and each have their own brushhead - that's the way the slightly older Oral-B Professional electric toothbrush that I own came. So be aware that if two people plan to use this Triumph toothbrush you are going to have to buy extra brushheads immediately as only one is included.

We looked a long time before we replaced our dead toaster oven.  There were quite a few things we didn't like about the old one and we didn't want to make the same mistake.  Thank God for Amazon reviews!  We bought this little workhorse and we aren't disappointed.  It makes great toast quickly.  It even gives you the option to toast frozen bread (just push button twice).  The stainless steel looks legit and it cleans up nicely.  For the money, this is a great little appliance.

My wife bought a different MP3 player in anticipation of a 12 hour each way road trip.  On the surface, it seemed the same as the Sansa Fuze, but with the addition of a built-in digital camera and a lower cost.  However, the manual was barely written in English, the user interface was clunky and cumbersome, and it didn't support organizing the music into folders the way our ripping software liked to put it.  Despite saying it supported MicroSD, it only supported the old standard of up to 2 GB cards.  Since our music collection requires around 8 GB, this was a source of great annoyance to my wife.  Luckily, she had bought it plenty of time in advance.  We returned it and ordered the Sansa Fuze.

However, it was scheduled to arrive for the day before our trip, so we wouldn't have time to mess with it if it wasn't up to par.  We put all our music on an 8 GB MicroSDHC card and hoped for the best.

When it arrived, we put our card in and it worked flawlessly.  The user interface was intuitive enough that we didn't even have to read the clear and concise manual.  It has a much more compact, sleek size than we expected from the pictures, and it came with a soft cloth protective cover.  The sound quality is great, and we were able to fit our entire music collection along with a couple of audio books, without having to carry a bunch of extra MicroSD cards along.  Most importantly, myself as an engineer and my not very tech savvy wife were both happy with it.

Two minor points of contention:  you can't make playlists from the device, although you can make them on your computer and the Sansa Fuze can use them, and the other colors than black inexplicably cost more.

I have the Saitek Pro Rudder Pedals, X-52 Flight Control System, and Flight Simulator X.  All these products are great, except for one thing on the Pro Rudder Pedals.  For the pedals, if you are on hardwood or vinyl flooring, you need some double sided foam tape or some other tape because the velcro set that came with it, the adhesive is very strong and actually pulled up some of my vinyl, but other than that the pedals work great!  The X-52 FCS is great too because it has so many programmable buttons, knobs, hat switches, and toggles and it has separate throttle and joystick components which it very realistic and fun to use!  I highly recommend not getting the PRO version because you pay $100 more just for a higher tension spring on the joystick and a black paint job.  These products work great and are very fun, however I recommend buying the complete bundle of Saitek Pro Flight Rudder Pedals, X52 Flight Control System, and Flight Simulator X for $260 with free shipping from DELL.com  Love Amazon, but I also love the best deal too.  Hope this helps!

I almost purchased this model - personally I think solid state drive will be the future - shock proof, no noise, faster, lighter - all in all far better than regular hard drive. However, there are two factors that push everyone out to HDD base : the more expensive price and much less capacity.
This machine is by far the highest capacity SSD netbook I can find in the market. Franking speaking 40GB is sufficient for regular use if you don't use it as multimedia power house - which I think you won't (even 160GB HDD is not capable to do the job).

I had bought this for my boyfriend who picks up our dogs poo (our deal, I feed, he cleans :P )  He said it was the best thing I've ever bought him, lol.  It's lightweight, and has the jaws of death that pick up ANYTHING.  It's got strong jaws which allows it to pick up heavier poop. And is far enough away that you don't have to smell or get too up to it.

This is a nice gate for a door opening, probably not the best choice for a stairway. We found it easy to install and is well made.  I don't know how some people found this to be junky.  The wood looks nice, too. Gates are a barrier not a babysitter, so for the price we found this to be good for door openings to our hallway.

The egg poach function totally sold me on this. And it does work fine. Cooks hard or softboiled eggs to perfection. Haven't tried the heating tray yet. The toaster function however is a different story. It seems it toast from one side only. Be careful to choose the right level, i "charcoaled" a few pieces of toast before i found the level that works for me.  
Also, take the time to read the instructions. Especially when you plan to use the toast and egg poach function at the same time. I didn't and freaked when the toaster part didn't work when i started poaching the egg. Well, doesn't it make only sense that the egg takes longer than the toast? Back To Basics wants to make sure both, your egg and toast are done at the same time.

We love all Battlestar Galactica!  This season with Baltar's trial and our favorite character, Romo Lampkin, was highly enjoyable.
My fifteen-year-old daughter loves the slightly older but still cool pilots.
My husband enjoys a new science fiction show that is really first-rate in terms of production and story and acting.
I am still amazed that an old lady like Mary McDonnell (and me) has a love interest.
It's fun having a show you can watch with a teenager and talk about.

They are OK diapers.  I buy them b/c they make me feel better about using disposable diapers.  I always seem to get the 3-4 diapers in a case that seem to be defective (cut wrong and don't have velcro).  The sizing is a little off too.  My son is not a four anymore but not quite a 5, either.  Because they are so stiff between his legs, there is really no 'play' with between sizes.  Too small you have messy accidents; too big, well you have big messy accidents b/c the diapers sags between their legs.  I have to say, the larger size works well for the night time wetting, but not good when he's active.  I am going to have to find an alternative for days.

I am by no means a camcorder expert, but I am a videophile and a Canon fan, so that's why I chose this camera.  It does not disappoint!  While 1080p would have been great, the birth of my son wasn't going to wait for technology to catch up to the top format.  

It has been great capturing all of the big "firsts" in high-def!  I rest easy knowing that it won't end up like my honeymoon footage that is grainy, lacks definition and, *gasp*, is in analog format on tapes!  I love the hard drive...it seemed the obvious choice over straight-to-dvd or memory card recording for so many reasons--no media to keep up with, speed and flexibility, and unmatched storage capacity...

The 'usability' of the camera is good, but not great.  The menus are easy to understand like my Canon digital camera.  However, the scrolling wheel can be tough to control.  It is easy to get stuck in ff or rewind mode by accident.  After not using the camcorder for a while, I forgot how to turn on the light, so it would be nice to have a few more dedicated buttons.  It's not like there isn't room, even on the tiny device.  None of this would be a problem if I used it more often.  

Anyways, people have talked about the software ad nauseam...so I won't get into that, except to say that the lack of available software to watch AVCHD files is frustrating, at best.  

The bottom line is that the HG10 excels at what a budget HD camcorder should--great video quality and (virtually) unlimited storage.  Where it lacks (usability, adjustments, etc) it more than makes up for it in the video quality department--and that's what matters most, right?

I love this scale.  It has helped me become very aware of what I am doing each day; eating, exercising and feeling better about myself.  I find it very easy to use & program.  I would definitely buy it again or give as a gift even.  It is very reasonably priced for all the features that it has. I have found that standing very still and not holding the handles super tight while weighing gives more accurate readings over time.

I bought this item originally to deal with noisy neighbors who were interrupting my studying with their loud bass music.  It's pretty hard to do calculus when Chingy is rumbling next door at 120 dBs.  Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be very good at drowning at bass.

Fortunately, any treble noises, appliance noises, movies/TV going in the same house, pets, etc... it absolutely muffles.  Keep it on low near a window and you won't be able to hear the rain fall outside.  Very handy.

I purchased this DVD based on the reviews that I read on Amazon.com and truly love her technique.  It is quite different then the other exercise videos I own.  I have been using it for a couple weeks now and trying to get it in at least 4 times a week.  I can feel a difference in my body.  I feel more toned.  I belong to a gym and always used heavier weights to try and build more muscle and I feel with this excercise dvd I am toning but slimming my arms and legs.

I'm a mom of a 2.5 year-old and I carry this ipod-sized camcorder with me EVERYWHERE I go. It's so easy to pull out of my pocket and record anything and everything QUICKLY and EASILY, especially those unexpected "first" moments or "awww" moments you just wish you could have a video of but would never bother lugging around a bulky camcorder that requires special charging and lengthy setup. My favorite use right now is to film my toddler opening gifts from long-distance relatives so they can see his reaction and personal "thank you" (encouraged by mom). Anyhoo, the kicker is that you simply "flip" out the USB arm, plug it in to your computer, and in less than a minute you're emailing videos to family and friends. Yes it's that fast. No doubt the most well thought out start-to-finish video solution I've ever seen. Nothing can compete with this!

I have owned several electric shavers in the past and tried many. My past favorite was the Braun syncro shaver which I have owned for 14 years and it still works good. Recently, I decided to try several of the new rotary shavers and they were just OK. Next I read several reviews of the new Braun pulsonic 9595 and since I really like my sonic toothbrush, I decided to buy the Braun 9595 from Amazon when it was on sale. Wow! What a fast and smooth shaver! It is easily twice as fast and shaves very close for an electric shaver. I especially like the option to rinse it out in the sink when I travel. This shaver is a keeper! Best of the best.

I like my coffee really strong, so I was worried that I would have to add so many coffee grounds that I would have the overflow problem like some mention. Not an issue at all. 

 Fill the cup with amount of water you want, pour into back of unit. Put a big ol scoop of coffee grounds in the filter, close the lid, set cup in place and push the start button down. The button lights up red and the water is heated and starts to drip into the coffee/filter within 20 seconds. When all the water is cycled through the unit shuts off automatically. Wait another minute for it all to drip through the grounds and tada, a hot cup of coffee. Remove the filter/container, dump it in sink and rinse with water real quick and ready for next time. It's really that simple. No fuss no muss.

 I drink about 3-7 cups of coffee throughout the day, never have any problems. If this ever breaks I will absolutely buy another one.

I've had one for a few weeks now, and many of the positive points of this unit have been mentioned in other reviews... it's convenient, effective, and fun. You chill the aluminum cannister in your freezer until it's frozen, dump the ingredients, and start it up.
 
 I would like to address some of the negative comments about &quot;freezing power&quot; and the lack thereof.
 
 First, all home ice-cream freezers produce a soft ice cream when they are done... this is normal, and if you read the directions in nearly every ice cream recipe, they will suggest another 2-3 hours in the freezer for the ice cream you make to harden properly. Don't expect to be able to eat it immediately.
 
 If you don't remember having to wait this long in your youth, keep in mind that White Mountain / brine-based ice cream churns typically have you &quot;pack&quot; the cannister in the brine after churning. This is much faster way to harden ice cream than putting it in a normal electric freezer because the 0 degree brine is in direct contact with the sides of the ice cream cylinder and conducts heat away much more quickly than the 0 degree air in a freezer. So 15 or 20 extra minutes in the brine may do as much good as 2-3 hours in the freezer.
 
 Second, if you end up with &quot;cold soup&quot; rather than ice cream as some have complained, you have one of two problems: either you didn't chill the ingredients in the fridge prior to freezing as reccommended in the instructions, or your freezer is set too warm. A good rule of thumb is that if your freezer is set so that premium ice cream you buy at the store (like Ben & Jerry's or Haagen Dazs) is easily scoopable, it's too warm for (a) long-term food storage, and (b) chilling a cannister. Buy a thermometer and make sure that your freezer is at 0 degrees or colder.
 
 My only negative comments about the unit are that the ice cream recipes in the book that comes with it are hit-and-miss. The quick / basic vanilla is quite poor- it would be best described as &quot;vanilla extract&quot; flavored ice cream, and because the milk isn't cooked, the texture and taste are more like a frozen whipped cream. The &quot;premium chocolate&quot; is like eating a frozen truffle... we enjoyed it, but it might be too bittersweet for kids. The sherbets are under-flavored, and the frozen yogurt is extremely yogurty and unlike what you buy commercially. Fortunately, you don't have to use their recipe. I highly recommend Alton Brown's &quot;burned peach&quot; ice cream... a quick google should find it at food.com.

I like just about everything about the machine.I like that I can keep the bowl in the freezer and make ice cream any time.  What that really means is that I don't have to fool with ice, salt, etc. &amp; I don't have to keep stirring it to keep the add-in's incorporated.I like that it makes just over a quart.  Just enough so I don't make too much (which I would probably do) of one flavor.  I like to try new flavors all the time so this is perfect for me.I like that it's pretty easy to clean with minimum mess.The ONLY draw back is that it is a little loud.  But since it only runs for about 1/2 an hour I can deal with it.  If the noise really bothered me that much I could either put it in another room or in the garage while it is running.  It doesn't make a mess and doesn't move around on the counter so I feel that leaving it unsupervised for a short time wouldn't be a problem.

Needless to say, it does a great job. My hygienist says that since I have used the Waterpik, my cleaning takes less time. She also says I should floss, but it really isn't necessary now. My dentist concurs. I wish I had started using a Waterpik years ago to avoid the expense of all the fillings and crowns I have needed.

1. THE PRODUCT PRICE HAS GONE UP DRAMATICALLY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AS NOTED BY OTHERS.
2. I TRIED TAX CUT (IT WAS A LOT CHEAPER) WHEN IT WAS NEW , BUT THE TURBO TO TAX CUT TRANSFER WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.  HAS ANYONE DONE A TURBO/TAX CUT CHANGE DURING THE LAST TAX SEASON?  WHAT WERE THE RESULTS?
3. INTUIT ALLOWS USERS TO EFILE FOR FREE ON BOTH FED AND STATE RETURNS WITH THEIR ONLINE SOFTWARE. HAS ANYONE TRIED THIS OPTION BEFORE?  WHAT ARE THE RESULTS?  MY CONCERN IS BEING AT THEIR MERCY TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN THE CD/DOWNLOAD.
4. ACCCORDING TO THEIR WEBSITE.  FOR CDs/DOWNLOADS, THEY STILL CHARGE $18 FOR STATE RETURNS AS LAST YEAR.  LOOKS LIKE THE FED EFILING IS FREE.
5. I'VE CONTINUED USING TURBO BECAUSE OF POTENTIAL HASSLES WITH OTHER PRODUCTS.  I'M STILL SATISFIED WITH THEIR PRODUCT DUE TO LONG TERM FAMILIARITY THAT HAS MADE ME AWARE OF ITS SHORTCOMINGS AND QUIRKS NOT UNLIKE MICROSOFT PRODUCTS.  
6. SO THE QUESTION: IS THERE ANYTHING BETTER OUT THERE?

My older dogs have been taking these chewable supplements for almost a year now.  One had been experiencing a lot of pre-arthritic pains and symptoms for a few months - but all signs disappeared within a month or two of taking the Synovi G3.  I like to think they were what did it!  The chewables are fantastic because the dogs think they're "treats" and look forward to getting them twice a day.  Also, small pills can be stuck into the chewables, and the dogs don't even know if they're being medicated.  This is an added bonus!  Just make sure you keep the nice tub (included) out of reach of the dogs - my counter-surfer pulled the tub down once and ate about three weeks' worth!!  (Bad gas was the only ill effect, thankfully!)

In one word ... FANTASTIC!  The Acer suits my needs perfectly.  Easy to carry, set up and operate - it only takes a little getting used to (like any new toy!).  But once you get the hang of it - you can't stop.  Everyday is a pleasant revelation.  So far,  I have no regrets.

Our old toaster wasn't doing a very good job, so we needed a replacement.  The criteria were 1) had to work well, 2) reasonable price, 3) stainless/black to match our kitchen, and 4) two-slice since there are only two of us.

Now, I'm not going to spend $200+ for a toaster, so models like those from Dualit were eliminated.  Consumer reviews raised significant concerns about several models.  For example, I find America's Test Kitchen reviews helpful but they recommended a Farberware model and there were quite a few negative consumer comments about this line.

My initial cut included T-Fal, Cuisinart, Kitchenaid, Braun, and the Haier.  Several folks didn't like the first three.  The Braun was interesting because it had a single, long slot that would fit baguettes.  However, folks weren't uniformly happy with it either.  This left the Haier, and I'm happy with it.

The Haier is a little wider than some bargain-price toasters.  The styling is kind of retro industrial, and it doesn't look cheap or flimsy.  I like it but it may not appeal to those who prefer a sleek modern look.  At 850 watts, it is similar to a lot of other 2-slice units.  

The Haier is quite functional.  Ventilation slots in the sides keep it cool while it operates.  The crumb tray slides out for easy cleaning (on my previous toaster the tray swung out, so you had to unplug the toaster and hold the whole thing over the sink or trash can to dump the crumbs).  The cancel button is a nice feature, better than having to jiggle the lever to stop a toast cycle.  The bagel setting toasts just one side, great for bagels and English muffins.  We haven't used the defrost setting, so can't report on that.

Toasting is even and fast.  The toast setting dial allows a wide range of settings.  Overall, this toaster works great and I heartily recommend it.  The price makes it a great value.

The Bible say that is pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to win the lost. Thinking that this movie will reach the lost is foolish as well, the acting is spotty at best, the editing and special effects are what you would expect for  TBN movie, and there are no big stars in the film. Reminds me of a lot of sermons I heard growing up when the preacher was less than artful with the text, and wasn't as prepared as one would like, BUT, at the end, people believed in Jesus. Why? Because God wants the glory on him, and it pleased him to use that man with that sermon to save those people.

That is the case with this movie. I am a movie snob, and can rattle off the laundry list of failings this movie has both from a technical and artistic point of view. But I absolutely loved this movie. The portrayal of a selfish man, gripped by his own lust and the devastation it caused to his wife and his marriage were spot on. It also did a great job of showing how he did not even think he had a problem, but his outward anger towards his wife and his demanding, confrontational encounters with her proved otherwise. The conversion scene was probably the first I have seen (that was not based on historical figures) that came off as genuine. The reconciliation in the marriage was something I have seen before (and I have seen failure too), and it was well done. The message here, that God empowers those who come to him to be the right kind of husband, is accurate. 

As this trend in Christian movie making continues, the production values will rise, the talent pool will get deeper, and the commercial success will get bigger and bigger. However, those films will fail to have the lasting impact of a movie like Fireproof if they are not bathed in prayer every step of the way, and are not characterized by obedience to God during production as this one was. Hollywood could do movies like this, but will not , because they are not content to let the message of the gospel make it to the screen unchanged. Those of us who love Jesus Christ recognize his truth when we see it, and we saw it in this film and it resonated with us.

The selfless picture of being a husband is one that will have (and has had) far greater impact than the movie that came before this which focused more on the "health wealth just obey God and you'll be a success" message. God may add a few children to the Kingdom through a football program at a high school, but he adds (and keeps) far more through faithful husbands and wives who put him first. The family is the building block of the Kingdom of God (it is that from which churches are built), and the building block of society. The societies produced and the churches made are effective if the family places the Lordship of Christ at the head of the priority list, and fireproof shows a couple who are now ready to take their place in the church and affect society.

By the way, I really liked that Caleb paid off his in-laws medical equipment and did not even tell his wife about it, seemingly on the day his wife dropped the divorce papers on him. When she saw that he had done that, and not even called her attention to it, she saw his transformation clearly and came back to him. That was a great plot element.

Anyway, I highly recommend this movie to believers, especially to those whose marriages are being ravaged by the sin of lust. Very true to life portrayal of what pornography does to a marriage.

I love pampers cruisers, but I gave them 4 stars for the following reasons:  if you take advantage of the free shipping on Amazon, you can never tell when the diapers are going to be shipped.  Unlike books, videos, etc., which seem to ship out fairly quickly, the diapers can take weeks. That said, as long as you plan ahead, it's an easy way to have diapers delivered to your door.  I'm also disappointed that Amazon's prices for boxes of pampers keep going up, but I realize that perhaps it's Pampers, not Amazon that is raising prices!

Amazon sells the two best (I know that is gramatically incorrect since there can be only 1 'best').

Cuisinart:  
1) $15 less, even taking into account the $5 KitchenAid rebate.
2) Nylon guard which means the preparer may use right in the cooking vessel.
3) Longer warranty (18 mos. versus 12 mos. KitchenAid).

KitchenAid:  
1) Multi-speed (versus 2-speed for the Cuisinart).
2) Mixing attachment is removable which means easier storage.

"What men really think about love, relationships, intimacy and commitment" is an accurate title for this book--at least it gives the author's point of view as encouraged by his friends. Although he did not interview thousands of men, the author does catch the flavor of the times and women will find the insights helpful as well as quite easy to integrate. Wise partners of both genders need to hear each other and develop flexibility and skill in guiding their relationships in positive, life-enhancing directions. This is a good place to get started for women who are dating again in later life after loss or divorce."

I've had this router for sometime.  I like the fact that it has gigabit ethernet ports and a usb port for hard drives, but can't use it because the firmware is buggy.  It hasn't been a disappointment so far.  I have had page loading faster with this router than others.  Video streaming isn't interrupted as it was with my old but reliable wrt54gs.  The two radios is a plus for those of us than want to take advantage of it.  I don't know if it's me, but this router didn't come with the vertical stand.  Is this something linksys is holding out on?  In the 5 ghz radio I get lower signal than in the 2.5 ghz radio.  All in all, this router has been great.  I think it needs improvement, but a simple final n firmware should fix it.

I was a Sunrocket customer :( for over two years and I was a relatively early adopter of Ooma after sunrocket blew up on the launch pad.  

I've had Ooma for over a year and in that time I have lived in two very different areas of the country.  As others have said, set up was a breeze and the functionality and quality is always amazing.  

The core system features are standard stuff you would get with any VOIP, where Ooma is really different (besides the obvious and important monetary cost savings you get)is in some of the premium features and also the device interface itself.  It bridges the gap between the ultra techy VOIP folks who check the website like an email account (tracking calls and voicemails) and the new VOIP adopters or old schoolers who like to listen to their messages from their answering machine.  The old school folks may like the idea of do not disturb for example, but they would never use it because they wouldn't want to log into their account online to change the option.  Ooma has a button right there on the device, problem solved.

VOIP is perfect for me because I like the convenience of a home phone but I never spend that much time on my home phone and I always have at least a DSL speed internet connection.  I have been waiting for Ooma for a long time, I mean I already pay for the internet connection why should I pay monthly for making calls that utilize that connection?

I shouldn't. With Ooma I don't have to!

That being said, the premier features are still a good deal for heavy phone users compared to the cost of other VOIP providers (even after the cost of the device), especially when you consider what you get.

I don't usually write reviews but Kitchenaid customer service exceeded my expectations.I bought one of these when they first came out. After using it the switch broke and Kitchenaid had a new one to my house the next day. Several months later my wife was making bread and it walked off the counter and cracked several tiles (operator error). It started making noise and I took apart the transmission and discovered a broken worm gear. I ordered a new part easily enough. However when it arrived it would not fit. I called Kitchenaid and discussed the problem with them. I clearly said that I damaged the mixer due to operator error. They had upgraded the transmission and they shipped a whole new mixer to me for free (and picked up the old one). The new mixer performs flawlessly. A good product but even better customer service.

This movie was just a stunning package of everything - heartbreaking music, touching characters, and a storyline that teeters between children and adult.

The movie starts off in a horribly depressing post-apocalyptic-looking wasteland, which sadly, is Earth, after having been abandoned by humans for 700 years and is still covered in garbage. Wall-E, the roving garbage compacting robot, has been performing his task ever since the humans left Earth. In all the time alone, he has developed a curious and lovable personality, and he has created countless sky-scraper tall towers out of little compacted trash cubes. While we see the depressing images of the skeletons of Wall-E's kind broken among trash heaps, Wall-E moves among abandoned highways, with his little cockroach pal and a lunch cooler in which he collects his favorite trinkets.

I knew this movie was supposed to be about a lonely robot, but I almost think that Wall-E doesn't even feel nearly as lonely as the viewer when they see the barren landscapes on Earth's surface. They did an incredibly job portraying the tragedy that befell the Earth and Wall-E's loneliness.

I'm sure most people reading this know that Wall-E has a sleek, high-tech girlfriend named Eve. It's not love at first sight for the two, however. Eve arrives on the Earth's surface with the task of finding and retrieving and forms of vegetation. Her mission is hopeless until Wall-E shows her a little plant seedling he found and saved in an old boot. She is taken back into space, as Wall-E clings desperately to the side of the ship to follow Eve wherever she may go - to the new home of the humans, a ship called the Axiom.

Wall-E struggles to win Eve's heart and protect his little seedling, as the captain tries to navigate the ship back to Earth, Eve realizes what Wall-E goes through for her, and the ship's computer Auto refuses to let that happen.

You will also meet an adorable team of misfit robots including a vacuum bot with allergies, a boxing massage bot, and the not-so-misfit OCD cleaning bot, Mo.

Aside from a couple adorable robotic sound effects, Eve and Wall-E's small vocabulary, a few old holographic videos still playing on Earth, and a few conversations between Auto and the captain, this movie really communicates without dialogue. Wall-E and Eve have a surprising array of emotional expressions, and you can't help but feel like these little robots have more human-like emotions than the actual humans themselves.

I've never really been a Pixar fan because I was afraid that 3D is killing 2D animation, but Wall-E entirely restored my faith. This is definitely a movie I could watch over and over.

I recently ordered this product off of Amazon and I am extremely satisfied.

First I will give you a run down of what equipment I use this with.  My laptop (Entertainment HP, 2GB RAM, with Vista), my surround sound (Phillips Hi-Def), my Sony PS3 (not the PS3 itself, but the charger for the controllers), car stereo, & iHome speakers.

When I was browsing potential MP3 Players my main concern was playlists and if the player could hold up under pressure (aka being on my arm while jogging, being dropped, and tossed around in general).

I have put songs on it (mostly MP3 & WMA format) from Windows Media Player on my laptop.  In order to create playlists, I first put them as a list in Windows Media Player and then right clicked on the list in order to send it to the player.  All of the songs were in the exact order I put them in (in the past I had experienced a problem with the MP3 Player jumbling things)!  The menu is easily to scroll through using the navigational keys.  The player also remembers where you left off in a song and in a list.  If I turn it off during the middle of the song all I have to do is scroll to "Now Playing" in the menu to pickup where I left off.  It came with a disc to install it, but all I had to do was hook it up to my laptop with the usb cord.  No installation was necessary (although my computer did have me name it).  No additional software was necessary.  Windows Media Player was enough.  I have not found a way to delete songs off of the player without hooking it up to the computer, but this is not a huge deal for me since everything else is perfect.

The volume goes up to 31.  I generally do not put it over 16 or 17, which is plenty.  The battery life has varied some.  I think this has to do with the days when I am constantly scrolling through songs as opposed to days where I select my list and let it play.  This makes it generally 7 to 10 hours, respectively.

It holds up while I am jogging.  I always prefer to purchase electronics that can take some abuse since I am clumsy.  This player has held up under my treatment (which is saying a lot)!

To charge it I did not purchase a charger.  I use the charger I bought for the PS3 controllers.  It works just fine and does not take forever to charge.  I also like that there are no batteries I have to replace.

I also hook the player up to iHome speakers so I can "jam out" when I am doing laundry or some other house chore.  It also works well with the surround sound system I have.  All I have to do is plug it in with the usb cord.

I highly reccomend this MP3 player if you're looking for something that works with the rest of your electronics.  In the past I have purchased players that have had serious compatability issues and it drove me nuts trying to figure out how to use them.  Next I am going to purchase one for my nine year old.  He already can use it perfectly!  So, if you're looking for compatability, user-friendly features, and durability, look no further!

Update as of 10/4/08

I dropped the mp3 player off the upstairs deck at my house and thought I broke it, but luckily there is a reset button on the lower back of the player.  You have to use a small point (I used a thumb tack) to press the button.  It was a total life saver.

Update as of 1/8/09

I noticed when I was updating the playlists that the playlists already on the player that had less than 18 songs on them were jumbled.  All of the playlists in which I had placed 18 or more songs on them remained perfect and in the order I had originally specified.

PS. I would highly advise buying different headphones.

I remember watching the original Battlestar Galactica series as a child.  I enjoyed the show immensely, and was disappointed with its cancellation.  But as much as I have enjoyed the original series, I have also become a fan of the new BSG series on SCI-FI.  As I have grown up, so has BSG.  The producers and writers have developed a program which can appeal to science fiction fans and non-fans alike.  The characters are much more human, more realistic here than in the original series.  Edward James Olmos makes a great successor to Lorne Greene in the role of Commander Adama.  Jamie Bamber, Katee Sackhoff and Grace Park have delivered delightfully believable performances as Captain Lee "Apollo" Adama, Lieutenant Kara "Starbuck" Thrace and Lieutenant Sharon "Boomer" Valerii, respectively.  And Mary McDonnell has been a joy to watch as President Laura Roslin.  The storylines have become more complex, engrossing and entertaining.  Instead of the gleaming, pristine spaceship sets of the the original program, the new BSG sets have a grittier look and feel which I absolutely love.  Season One of Battlestar Galactica has been extremely enjoyable, and I am currently enjoying Season Two (a milestone the original BSG never reached).

I loved putting our infant son into his sleep sack knowing he wouldn't get uncovered in the middle of the night and that it wouldn't end up on top of his face.  It made ME sleep much better since I wasn't constantly worrying about him and if he was hot or cold.  I always used long sleeved sleepers and gowns with socks when it was really cold.  As the weather got a bit warmer, I didn't use socks.  I liked being able to unzip him from the bottom (it didn't wake him up) in case I wanted to check his trunk and feel if his temperate was too hot or just right.  He always felt "just right" to me :)

I don't use it now b/c it's pretty warm at night and he grew out of it at about the same time.  I'm thinking of finding a smaller size for the arrival of our next baby in January.  I think these are GREAT and recommend them to anyone.  Of course, get the right size if you're worried about it slipping over their face!

It only took a few times putting his fingers in his mouth before he stopped.  He didn't even complain about the horrendous taste. My one year old accidently got some on his tongue and it made him vomit. A few weeks later I saw my 4year old try biting his nails again and i painted on the malvala and he hasn't put his fingers in his mouth again.  It really truely worked.

Whoever invented these SwaddleMe wraps ought to get some kind of prize. It's one of those products that you keep wondering what you would ever do without it. We have three SwaddleMe wraps for our new baby (now two months old and growing fast). Two are jersey and are now getting  little small for him. It's now getting a little cooler (late Fall), so we got a larger microfleece model. Junior seems to appreciate the extra warmth and room  I'd say the wrap is more effective and harder for him to get out of.

A good wrap often quiets our baby down. He doesn't like getting wrapped and often cries loudly, but once he's wrapped he quiets down and even smiles. It's like magic. Somehow, when he can't flail his arms and legs around, he stops crying. Also, he seems to sleep better and for longer spells. Last night was the second of two 6-hour nights. That's worth the price in itself! Our little boy seems to like this fleece model a little better. Maybe he likes the extra warmth. Maybe it's the softness. Mabe it's the larger size. My wife worries a little that the fleece model seems to ride up onto his mouth and might suffocate him. Personally, I think she worries too much, but I'm a little more careful in wrapping him. I'd say, if he could speak, he'd say Swaddle Me in Microfleece.

Ours is a short haired cat - a Burmese.  She is a diva princess who enjoys wrapping me around her paw.  She has an excellent mind which she displays by talking a lot and by sauntering purposely purposelessly around the house.  She's a proud cat and likes to boss her staff around.  For example, she sometimes gets hungry at 3 in the morning.  She then chirps a little.  When that doesn't work, she simply starts licking noses - our noses.  And then, like a teen girl who wants the keys to the family car, she stares with wide eyes and purrs until I get up to give her a snack.  Sometimes she eats it but usually it's simply a demonstration of power.

And then we got the furminator.  The princess enjoys her prettiness but does not enjoy being brushed.  She was surprised by the furminator because it didn't feel like a brush but, when she realized she was being groomed, she reacted as though I was intentionally humiliating her in front of all her paramours.  She screeches, she spits and she writhes until she understands I am in charge.  She resigns herself for a few minutes and then cranks the drama up again.  What a wonderful feeling it is to have this cat demanding something of me and realizing it's not going to happen.  What a wonderful feeling to know she is furious but powerless.  And the feeling lasts even after the brushing is done - she slinks off to a corner to groom herself because, obviously, I've made a mess of her.  But then she gets over it and hops into my wife's lap for consolation.

If you have a diva - get one of these things.  It's like chicken soup for the spirit and it makes her pretty.  Her coat is shiny and all the raggedness of the undercoat is gone.  I am always surprised how much hair comes out but she never looks bald.  

Five stars.  For sure.

This is the best coffee maker I have ever owned.  To add the coffee you lift up the top cover rather than pulling out the filter area from the front.  This feature makes all the difference in the world.  My last coffee maker was a KitchenAid but the quality of this Cuisinart cannot be compared.  Most other coffee maker are just plastic, this one is beautiful and sturdy brushed stainless steel and looks great on my counter.  The clock and timer are easy to program.  Definitely a step above the rest!

Update 2 Years later... I still love this coffee maker, we use it all the time and it still works perfectly and looks like new.

Two weeks ago I read and immediately implemented the process that David Allen outlined in his book and I'm already reaping the benefits. Before reading the book I actually considered myself fairly organized, but I didn't realize how blind I was to the 'nooks and crannies' of my stuff: stubborn undone tasks, books promised-to-get-read yet never do, things that get piled in a corner waiting for . . . ; you know what I'm talking about. They get lodged and lost in the shuffle. But Allen's book helped me to take off the blinders and 'put everything into IN (the IN box)', literally! He actually recommends getting and using an in box! Believe me, before I didn't have one, but, low and behold, the thing serves a very useful purpose! DUH!

I'm a GTD newbie, but a lot of what Allen recommends just makes simple common sense, like his suggestion to contextualize our action items, that is, just make your lists based on where you are (at computer, at phone, at home, at office, etc), not on a perennially overly-optimistic list of things to do TODAY (that then have to be remade again TOMORROW because we seldom get half the things done on our list). Allen says that this self-demoralizing process is a dead end. 

But Allen's process of gaining a complete inventory has given me a fuller view of what I need to do and has helped me to process whole groups of tasks at a time.

The book is long on process and relatively short on specific applications, but is well worth the mind effort that it takes to apply to your own challenges. In other words, the strength of Allen's GTD is demonstrated by the fact that it can work with paper- and computer-based processes. He assumes the lowest common denominator: paper-based, simply because everyone can relate to that. The problem for me was that I use a Palm Tungsten E2 synched to Microsoft Outlook. Thankfully plenty of quality third-party materials can be found on the web that use Allen's GTD. And actually David Allen's own website, www.davidco.com, has a wealth of free practical knowledge.

I give GTD a five-star rating.

I use my shuffle mostly when cleaning house, working out in the garden, mowing the lawn (a 3 hour task), and occasionally when relaxing after my chores are done.  The 2 GB capability is more than enough for my average music needs and the handy clip feature allows me to tuck the shuffle safely inside my clothing (yes, to my bra) away from dust and dirt.  I am able to work outside most of the day for several days with no battery shortages. After a few hours of wear, the ear buds become uncomfortable, also they do not block out the noise of the mower.  I solved this by purchasing a bud designed to fit comfortably in smaller ears, which also allows me to listen to music when mowing.

The sound quality is excellent and installing music from my itunes was a breeze.  There is no display screen or menu, but those are frills I would not use enough to consider paying extra money for.  The 2 GB Shuffle is perfect for my needs.

Before WALL-E starts, there is a cartoon short. This cartoon features a baby bunny who works for a magician. The bunny wants a carrot, and most of the cartoon is spent on bunny's efforts to get the carrot. The magician is able to put his hand into a bag, and have it come out of his hat, even when his hat is 20 feet away from him. At one point, the bunny is off to the side of the stage and holding the hat. The magician stuffs his hand in the bag, and it comes out of the hat, but when it comes out it touches an electric socket. The electric shock causes the magician to dance. A couple of members of the orchestra take out a banjo and washboard and play some rapid-fire bluegrass music, to accompany the magician's clogging dance! Yee-hawwww! At another point in the cartoon, a rope hoists a piano up above the stage. As one might expect, it later crashes down with a bang. The bunny-rabbit cartoon is colorful and features many crazy angles. The bunny cartoon is a masterpiece. The bunny cartoon is filled with action, attractive colors, and clever antics. FIVE STARS for the bunny cartoon. 

Now this is about WALL-E. The movie called "WALL-E" is a severe disappointment.

The film begins with a robotic trash compactor working in a trash dump near a big city, perhaps Chicago or New York City. The robot lives in a little metal house, situated on the site of the garbage dump. The little house has many interesting things inside, such as amusing knick-knacks that the robot finds and collects, during his daytime job of compacting trash. The robot also likes to watch a Broadway musical (Hello Dolly) that features corny singing and dancing. I liked this part of the movie. I liked the clever knick-knacks in the robot's house, for example, the Rubik's cube. 

Then, the love interest arrives. It is a probe robot, sent by a colony of humans to seek for plant life on earth, in order to determine if it is safe for the space-bound earthlings to return to earth. The probe robot successfully finds a little plant, provided by Wall-e. The little plant is kept in a child's leather boot. The probe robot has violent instincts, and causes widespread destruction around the trash dump, by way of a ray gun. For example, the probe robot destroys a row of large oceangoing ships, destined for compacting. In fact, Wall-e cringes in fear at the probe robot's indiscriminate use of the ray gun. It is not at all clear why Wall-e falls takes a liking to the violent space probe. At any rate, Wall-e does. 

When it comes time for the lovely female space probe to return to the mother ship, Wall-e clings to outside of the shuttle ship, and joins the humans on space colony. At this point, we are introduced to the humans who, for 700 years, have done nothing but gain weight, watch television, and eat junk food. There are some typical fights and chase scenes involving Wall-e and the robots in the space station. Another source of conflict is that the automated computer running the space station attempts to take over. (This part of the plot does not fit into the basis premise of the movie. This part of the plot was arbitrarily copied from the Stanley Kubrick classic, 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY). 

Other reviewers have pointed out that WALL-E contains no dialogue, aside from chirps/squeak sounds of Wall-e and the female space probe. What bothered me was the lack of interesting scenery in WALL-E. Much of the movie is spent in an ugly garbage dump. The garbage dump is a monotonous light brown or orange color. WALL-E dwells extensively on the obesity, consumerism, laziness, excessive eating of junk food, and excess television watching of the people in the space colony. Although there is a grain of truth to this (especially as to obesity), I would not characterize human beings, or American people, as lazy and prone to eating too much junk food or to excessive television watching. Because of the movie's constant dwellings on obesity, laziness, consumerism, and excessive TV watching, I found most of WALL-E to be an insult. The writers of WALL-E failed to understand the virtues of subtlety. WALL-E is simply not cut from the same cloth as other Pixar films, such as Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, or Toy Story 1 and 2.

Showtime has blown HBO off the map with the these two seasons of Dexter. Now that The Sopranos, Deadwood and Rome no longer around, HBO will need a miracle to compete with the quality of this show. 

Season two is all about conflict and questions. Lila or Rita? Serial killer or turn himself in? There isn't as much "Dexter Morgan justice" this time around, but the suspense and top notch acting are here in bucket loads. Just give Michael C. Hall an award already!

If you liked the first season (how could you not?) then the second will take you to a different place. They change things up a bit to add freshness, but they never veer too far off course. I think season one was a bit stronger overall, yet I found this one more interesting. I guess it just means that this show is full of surprises.

Love the size, keyboard, speed.  Boots up quickly.  One huge problem is the shiny plastic case.  It shows absolutely every smudge.  I can't imagine how it would look if you used any hand creams.  Very high maintenance shiny black plastic.  They send a cleaning device, be prepared to use it every time you open the case.  I am going to buy a sleeve that opens and stays attached.  Otherwise it looks totally smudged and greasy.  Battery life is actually correct!

This flash drive has a significant amount of space and is "hardened" against shock (rubberized coating). This also keeps it from getting a five star rating from me. It is a tad thick if you want to stack something else in a close USB port, but of course the coating which makes it thick also gives it protection, so it depends on what you are looking for. This is a good product.

When I first got this mouse I was pretty excited, I opened it up and plugged it in. I was very impressed with the 2 different kinds of grips and extremely impressed with how smoothly and perfectly it moves while playing games. The DPI switch above left click is so handy, I can change it without thinking, depending on the mood I'm in or what weapon im using while playing a game. This is the first gaming mouse I have had but I have to say I'm pretty picky when it comes to movement and comfort but it is just amazing, a very great mouse if you are a gamer. It took me a few days to really get comfortable with this mouse but once your there it is a keeper, Very great mouse, buy it.

Reviews for 160 GB and 500 GB drives are combined here so it's not clear about 500GB drive power. I have the 160GB and it runs from USB power (love it, but need more space). 

Amazon's Technical Details for the 500GB drive state "Powered via external AC-Power Supply (included)" and some reviewers report that the external supply is necessary. Others report otherwise about their SimpleTech drive.

Can the 500 GB drive operate from the USB port without the external AC supply? 

NOTW: not all USB ports are created equal in terms of how much power they can deliver. I have the 160GB SimpelTech and it would NOT run on one USB laptop port but would run on an adjacent port. IOW, one port could not supply enough current whereas the other could. Ditto for various USB ports on my desktop: some worked, some did not. I belabor this point because there was no indication from the ST drive that it was insufficiently powered. The LED lit OK but the drive simply clicked away in futile desperation while trying to spin up. 

So.... I am guessing that the Reviewers who couldn't get the 500 GB to work on their PC/laptop did not connect to a high-powered port. Can anyone confirm that the *500 GB* drive runs on USB power alone? Thanx

I have had this mixer for about 4 months now and I cannot say enough good things about it. I make rotis/tortillas very regularly and this not only saves tons of kneading time but avoids the mess and actually makes the dough softer. once you get the hang of flour to water proportions just throw it all in if you want, adjust it to speed 2 and add in a few drops of oil when it's almost done. You will have soft, slightly warm and perfectly consistent dough. I have also used this for batters and the consistency is amazing. It is very easy to clean and even though it's dishwasher safe I love this machine so much that I quickly hand wash vessel after each use.

This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  The characters, although animated robots, have great emotions and relationship development.  There is even a strong save the earth message.

Voice activated gadgets, remote start for my car, TV remotes, won't be long till we get to the "cupcake in a cup" stage.  A definite classic.  Way to go Pixar... again!

This computer is small, powerful,and a whole lot of fun. It has exceptionally powerful wireless network detection, it's speedy and can handle a lot more than I thought. I also appreciate the placement of the fans because they don't get blocked when I place the computer on my lap like my other laptop does. I can't help but be struck by the quality of this little notebook-they built it with the same sturdiness and attractiveness of a regular laptop (unlike some others, who have a plastic, creaky encasement). While the battery life is a concern, there are several other options out there to choose from, and lenovo is supposed to release a 6 cell battery. For me, however, battery life is just fine, and since it charges pretty quickly, bringing it to lectures is a blast!

As is true with all netbooks, the keyboard will take some getting used to-especially the small shift key on the right side of the keyboard. Also, they combined the arrow keypad with the brightness and volume controls instead of the scroll controls! Not sure what they were thinking on that one :).

This computer boots up superfast as well. Oh, and an important thing to know about this small netbook is that it is easily upgradeable if you want increased performance or hard drive space.

All that being said, I MUST mention that, not only is this a great little netbook, lenovo's customer service was fantastic. I called them several times and have gotten thorough, thoughtful, and attentive customer service from their representatives. I actually reached a real person in a decent amount of time who knew what he was talking about!! If you ask me, that alone tops the score off to 5 stars. Thanks Lenovo for paying extra attention to your customers!

I bought this collar because behavioral training was not working as well as I would have liked with my very vocal dog (a rescue that was formerly an outside-only dog)and I didn't want to resort to an electronic collar to train her.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the citronella collar did indeed work well at reducing the incidence of barking. My "chatty" girl caught on after getting sprayed only a few times, although she sometimes will still bark very quietly (below the trigger threshold) when she's really motivated (this is called getting collar smart).  It's not a 100% cure and isn't supposed to be, but it definitely made a difference within a very short period of time.  If you use this collar and have more than one dog in close quarters, be aware that another dog's bark can trigger the collar to spray, resulting in a false correction for the wearer.

I've had this collar for more than three months now and have yet to go through the original container of citronella, another indicator of how quickly it worked.  My only complaint is that the collar did not come with the 6 volt battery that was advertised as part of the package.  The end of the adjustable collar was also a challenge to thread through the piece that holds it in place, but it gets there with a bit of work and a whole lot of patience.

Overall I would say this is a very good training aid.  It's considerably less expensive than a good quality electronic collar and completely humane.  If you also like the lemony-fresh scent of citronella, this is the way to go.

This review is for TurboTax Online. I have used turbotax now since my 2005 return. It has been the best thing for me compared to having a tax professional do my taxes. I get triple the return I did with my tax guy (and it didn't matter if I used H&R Block), and I don't pay so much for my filing. I use the deluxe edition and e-file my returns every year, and this year I got a return of $5700. I have already received my state return, and will be getting my federal return around Feb 6th. This is the best program around, and I have tried others out there, none compared to turbotax. The thing I really like about this online program is that if you need help, there are helpful links, online advice, live chat, or help over the phone. You can't go wrong, and plus they offer audit support just in case the IRS decides to take a closer look at you. They also have this meter bar to show you if you are a target for audit or not. Great product, and I would and do recommend this product to anyone wanting more money from their returns.

I actually made that leap to Mac last year.  After the learning stage, as it occurs with most if those switching from PC to Mac, I was very happy.  The jump was made from a system with XP as the OS.  I did not like XP very much and was definitely not willing to go to Vista, with all of the bad reviews.  After purchasing and setting up this laptop for my wife to use, I will say to review readers that I like Vista (at least this 64bit version) much more than the final version of XP, which i used for a few years.  It is a pleasant interface that acutally has much of the intuitive functions of the modern Mac OS.  And now, getting to the product I am reviewing, I will add that this innexpensive machine handles Vista64 VERY well.  While I dont have too much experience with the product, I have a very good first impression.

The product is durable, as i said, it was with me in Iraq, when i took it home to DC on leave, and currently now in the UK.  i've spilled juice on it, dropped it a few times, and it still runs like a champion.  I've not experienced heating problems like some others and i leave my plugged in 24/7,  but i guess you just have to have it in an area where it can breathe.

The FURminator is the best hair removal tool I've ever used.  We have three furry dogs and this tool has cut down on the amount of fur around the house considerably.  Each time we comb them with it I am amazed at how much hair comes out.  A great investment.  I would suggest using outdoors if possible as hair literally pours off the animals and would create quite a mess in the house if you weren't extremely careful (and we certainly try to be but sometimes the dogs have other ideas).

I had a Logitech Driving Force Pro for a while, but its lack of an H-pattern shifter and a clutch pedal gave me an excuse to turn to something better - the G25.

When I first opened the infamous green Logitech box that housed the product and grabbed out the wheel, I was surprised by a few things:

1. The weight - The three items that consist of the G25 weigh markedly heavier than the Driving Force Pro. The pedal base seems much more sturdy. The steering wheel feels about the same, and of course there's the new shifter.

2. The easy movement of the wheel - anyone who has owned a Driving Force Pro knows that it's relatively difficult to turn due to the friction in the motors; the G25 glides as I turn it back and forth.

3. The cheap plastic! - a turn off was the build quality of some of the parts. I was almost dismayed to see that the spokes that are used to tighten the clamps were flimsy and difficult to turn, and it took me a whole 15 minutes to figure out how to depress the knobs to tuck away. The clamps seem flimsy especially on the shifter. Fortunately physics works - despite the appearance, the shifter and the wheel were both quite firm when attached to my table.

As for the other parts - the shifter felt as other reviewers had described - flimsy and unrealistic, and my second gear didn't seem to be very weak, as if it were a person hanging off a cliff, about to be throw back into neutral. The top of the shifter is cheap plastic, not the aluminum that decorates the rest of the system. Otherwise, everything else seemed to look good.
4. The alarming clearance of the wheel clamps - sadly, Logitech still assumed that all tables and desks made in the world are an inch thick. Well both my coffee table and my dining table (both from IKEA, mind you I'm a college student) are about two inches thick, and i couldn't fasten the wheel onto either surface. What's confusing is that the SHIFTER seemed to have more than two inches of clamp clearance, so I affixed that to my coffee table. Fortunately I had another wooden table that was under an inch in thickness, and I clamped my wheel down there.

5. The tiny area of the carpet grip on the pedals - the base of the G25 pedals is huge compared to that of the Driving Force Pro. I expected a wider area of "spikes" to be used for carpet grip, but I was perplexed to see the same ~ 2" x 12" strip of spikes for the carpet. When I set the carpet grip down though, I noticed after you push to an extent, the grip really grips the carpet, and the base ain't moving nowhere after that.

=====================================================================

USING THE WHEEL

Okay, I popped my laptop in front of me and I played around in Live For Speed until I really got the hang of the wheel, and I'll tell you that I was genuinely surprised. The wheel isn't just accurate and good - it's amazing.

The Driving Force Pro was a solid wheel and had good force feedback, but it was hard to turn and a bit rough sometimes. The G25 is a new level of force feedback, smooth and quiet. The wheel turns easily through all 900 degrees of freedom, and the pedals accurately represent what pedals should feel like in real life*.

*To be annoying, yes I do have some critiques about the wheel - to truly mimic a real car's pedals, first of all the pedals should be spaced out a bit farther - they are a bit cramped. The brake pedal's resistance is flat throughout its depression - in a real car, the resistance increases linearly with amount of depression. Lastly, and I know this isn't exactly feasible - the clutch pedal needs more travel distance to really simulate a car's clutch pedal.

But who cares about all that? Unless you're a real hardcore player with money to burn (you wouldn't be buying this wheel by the way), nobody's going to care. The freaking wheel costs under $300, a fraction of what hardcore players pay for their systems (which run up thousands of dollars). That's the main theme of this review - you get amazing quality for the price you pay.

More about the pedals - they simulate the experience much better than that of the Driving Force Pro's pedals, because when I give it half throttle in my DFP, the car will barely accelerate (but we know when we drive in real life that half throttle is something like 80% of your maximum acceleration), whereas in the G25, it's much closer to what I experience in my car. One more thing about the carpet grip - when I said before that they render your base immovable, I lied; when I heel-toe shift sometimes (read: push the clutch in often and hard), I notice a tendency (very small though) for the base to rotate clockwise and slide back a little. This doesn't happen when I press the gas pedal though. After a long round of playing, I will have to readjust my pedal base, but I think it's just because I want a perfect playing position, and most people wouldn't mind.

And for games that support a clutch (i.e. Live For Speed, which is amazing with the G25), you can slip the clutch and find that sweet spot where it hooks; you can stall your car, do drifting techniques (like clutch kicking), drop the clutch without having to worry about spending real money to replace your transmission, etc. In short, the pedals cannot be better for something that costs like $250.

The wheel, I already talked about. In summary, it's basically the DFP but quieter, smoother, better as a whole. The only small thing I'd like to mention is that there are only two buttons on the steering wheel. I miss being able to look backwards by holding two buttons down. Currently I use the left button for look left and the right one for look right. I do like the buttons on the gear shifter, as they're laid out very well and I can know which button I'm pushing without looking down (4 is the upper limit for being able to just feel around to push the right button).

Lastly, the shifter...yes the shifter is a real turn off when using the G25, and this I will make a legitimate complaint about; the least Logitech could have done is to put something inside the lever to increase its resistance, and to actually HOLD it into gear (accidental bumping of my gear shifter will throw it back into neutral). The craftsmanship is excellent though, and designwise it's just great to simulate a real H-shifter, with a German feel to have reverse as push-down-sixth. 

In summary, I'm very happy with my G25. Although it's not a perfect wheel and has some shoddy design qualities, you aren't going to find anything in the market that's competitive with its design less than two or three times its price.

Score: 4+/5

I, like many others, purchased this book after seeing the preview for the movie.  I had heard about this but never gave it much thought.  Unlike Sin City and V for Vendetta, I decided that this time I will actually read the material before I watch the movie.  Well, I have to day it's not at all what I expected and now I'm not so sure I want to watch the movie at all.  

For anyone who's going to use this review as their basis for deciding wheather or not they are going to read Watchmen, let me start by telling you that this is a thinking piece, not an action piece.  It does have some action, but it's pretty sparse (though it is entertaining when it comes about.)  Watchmen is more of a character drama, and considering the graphic medium, the characters are fairly complex and interesting.  Each one has their own unique story and reasoning behind becoming a "costumed adventurer," aptly named due to the fact with the exception of Dr. Manhattan, that they don't have any true super powers.  I am very impressed that Moore never included any character "thought text" to tell you what they were thinking.  He manages to do it all with dialogue, faacial expressions and situations.  

I was drawn in from the very beginning.  The book wastes no time as it starts with the murder of a long time costumed hero and an ensuing investigation his former colleagues.  We are introduced to these retired heroes one at a time with plenty of snippets of back story to explain how it all came about and why in this alternate reality, costumed heroes are a part of everyday life.  

The further I got into Watchmen, the stranger it became and as it ended, I realized it wasn't at all what I thought it would be.  It's almost a study of human character and I'm sure that someone more intelligent than I would be able to pick it apart and analyze it to death, drawing parallels to real life situations.  I really did enjoy it and I'd recommend it highly, but not to everyone.  There are plenty of readers who don't want to read a book for story and characters alone and those readers may not find what the are looking for here.

This brings me back to the movie.  I can't really see this story working as a blockbuster Hollywood film.  If they keep the movie very close to the source material -which I hope they will- it's going to be a lot different than people expect.  If they try to appeal to a wider audience and throw in some extra action, they're going to detract from the story and the people who appreciate the book may be dissapointed.  But, so far from what I'm seeing in the preview, it looks like it's going to keep pretty true to the book.  And Dr. Manhattan looks awesome.

But this review is about the book, not the movie.  I really liked it.  It may be the best comic book/graphic novel I've ever read.  But, I haven't read any comics since I was a kid and even then not so much.  I don't quite think I'd call Watchmen a masterpiece or compare it to some of the best regular novels I've read, but I liked it.  It's earned a permanent place on my shelf and I look forward to rereading it in the future to see what further tidbits I can get out of it.

I love this coffee maker. I thought the little dials would be a pain to use but they are very easy. The coffee brews fast, tastes great, and is very hot! You can control the temerature of the hot plate, which is a feature I love. But it's turned out not to be that necessary because as soon as the coffee is done brewing it is nice and piping hot. I've had so many problems with warm coffee from other coffee makers. By the time I'd put my cold creamer in, I'd have to microwave the cup. Not so with the Cuisinart. The only thing I think I would change about this product is to include a lighted LCD screen. It is not easy to read since it is small and not backlit. I know other reviewers have said that their's have died after a year. I really hope that doesn't happen. I've owned it now for about 8 months, so we'll see. I live for my morning coffee and this maker definitely meets all of my expectations.

I love this iPod.  I have enjoyed being its new owner for a month now.  Have traveled to Hawaii and just returned last night from Key West so it has gotten lots of use keeping me entertained on the flights.  I downloaded an audio book and listened on my flights yesterday.  Has a good battery life per charge.  I find it very easy (having not owned a prior gadget like this) to download music and audiobooks to.  Today I plan on downloading an unabridged audiobook for my flight to Barcelona in 2 weeks.  

The ONLY issue I have is that it slips out of my hands very easily.  I have dropped it 3 times now which scares me.  I do wish Apple or ?? would have released a padded cover for this iPod when they released the product since I cannot find anything out there.  The end.

This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)

      



WALL.E SPOILER ALERT

WALL.E, the latest from Pixar is another amazing film. How they manage to churn out great film after great film is anyone's guess. When every other studio manages to just recycle old pond scuzz, they consistently produce gems, time after time.

WALL.E is a science fiction film that has an eco message imbedded within. The film does not attempt to sway your view or convert you to agree. It simply tells a tale, a very good tale, and then the film ends. If you do not care to see the message the film does not care. Nor do I imagine do the filmmakers for that matter. 

The story, as is usual for PIXAR, is a multi-faceted one. If you are a simple child there are simple laughs. There is also a simple very easy to understand story of friendship, companionship, love, or what ever you care to call it, between the two main characters, WALL.E and EVE. The more complex side story is: what happened to all the humans? For a while one can imagine some great garbage catastrophe. We quickly learn humanities fate. We left all the garbage behind and are off in space aboard some cosmic cruise ship. I have heard that cruises are notorious for all the food that is provided. Once we find humanity we see what has become of them. FAT.E is all that comes to mind. This is not hard to imagine. Drinking a burger through a straw. I bet some genius is already hard at work on that one as I write. 

I love all the references in the film for those who are old enough to get them. Kubricks 2001 is riding shotgun in this film and when this comes out on DVD it will have no better home on my shelf than beside 2001. real science fiction is not about space cowboys, it's about small, or grand, intelligent scientific ideas that propel the story forward. The idea in this film is what will become of us. I'm sure the film has the broad strokes right. Just like the Kubrick/Spielberg film AI, this film imagines a future where robots are everywhere. I can easily buy this. We are headed in that direction right now. Just a few hops, skips, and jumps before we crack that next big nut and grandma is being cared for by medi-bot. This was the profound part of the film. 

It is still, at it's core, a kids film. My son laughed his WALL.E off while he was watching it. I laughed too, although the theater was mostly quiet at the bits I found hilarious. EVE destroying a dozen oil tankers and seeing them topple like dominoes was one great bit. The fat captain standing up (probably for the first time in his life) to the music from 2001 was another. 

In the end the film simply ended. It had no grand hidden secret, or any huge complex message to unload. Take care of the Earth, try not to eat too much. Most of what I took away was that love is the most important thing we have, and our loved ones help define us. When EVE, kisses WALL.E in the end and her electric spark gives him back his memory, (soul) I was impressed. Simple yet effective. 

I know from Cars that these films need more than one viewing to let them sink in properly. This is not Flushed Away, Bee Movie, or Shark Tale, This is a PIXAR film and it should stay with you long after you go home. 

I rarely do this any more with hardly any film, but I may use my son as an excuse to see this film a second time. Beyond being just a great story, it was also beautiful beyond belief. The music was also very well thought out. It was nice to hear some rather unconventional songs in this film. I will surly be getting the soundtrack and score.

WALL.E was also the most human character in the film. I love when he finds the box with the diamond. He tosses the flashy diamond and keeps the interesting box. WALL.E is right on. Scrap the flashy bling and go for the simple more useful things, and pleasures in life. 

I could go on forever about this film. Just see it. You'll love it.

I just finished reading BD and loved it! I came online to post my review and was surprised at all the low ratings. I have always enjoyed SM's storytelling ability and she did not disapoint me.

This book is going on my keeper shelf with the rest of the Twilight Saga and I know I will revisit them.

I may not be Stephenie Meyer's target audience.  But I do love vampire books (Anne Rice, Poppy Z. Brite, White Wolf novels, P. N. Elrod, Laurell K. Hamilton, to name a few), and I've always been attracted to the forbidden love theme.  Being a huge fan of Shakespeare, including Romeo and Juliet, one of my favorite plays, it's immensely enjoyable to see this theme throughout her novels.

Now to the novel...  I don't want to give away anything.  The novel picks up where the first in the series of novels left off.  Bella has been rescued from the clutches of James, and all would seem well in her world - or so you would think.  Bella is in her last year of high school, and all of the events of "normal" human life are paralleled with numerous supernatural events.  A number of threads from the previous novel carry over into this one, including some enemies thought gone and an expansion of some of the mythology introduced in the first novel.  One of the most significant events involves the absence of some important characters in Bella's life and her subsequent reaction to that happening.  Bella spirals into depression, but comes out of it with the help of Jacob Black and her newly discovered reckless side of her nature. 

Much like the first novel in the series, this novel climaxes at the end of the novel in a very exciting way that will, no doubt, leave readers of the series very satisfied.  A number of characters and locations mentioned in the first novel are expounded during the climax at the end.  The ending clearly lays the foundation for future novels.

"New Moon" is as exciting as the first novel in the series, and I would easily recommend it to fans of the series.

I have two older cats who are beginning to show hip and knee pain of arthritis.  The vet recommended this item and it really works!  All symptoms disappeared after just two days of pills. It is easily mixed in with a bit of wet cat food.  I keep giving the pills for an additional three - 5 days and then just wait for another episode. It really works as the cats are their usual mobile selves again; climbing stairs, hopping up on chairs and laying in their usual pretzel like cat positions!

Just as the title suggests, this external hard drive is just as expected. I never planned to use it to increase my computers running speed, I just needed a place to store files like pictures and movies that I won't be looking at frequently. I've had it for over a month now and still no problems. The only hinderance is that it has to be plugged into the wall at all times (When in use). I knew that while purchasing it however, so there is no misleading fault of the seller. 

A very good hard drive, and very inexpensive. I would highly recommend this to anyone who simply needs a place to store files.

In the spirit of helping my children learn that healthier eating DOES NOT necessarily mean no more treats, we got a couple of these on a Buy 1, Get 1 deal at a local store. We packed them for lunches on a few different days as a treat, and they have been requested ever since. They taste delicious, according to the kids.

As for Mom, I like them because they are much more healthy than the standard high-fructose corn syrup laden "fruit" treats that are typically marketed for kids. We tried the Clif Z-bars first (rave reviews) and then moved on to these. It says a lot to me that these children's treats were among the first to comply with California's more strict school-lunch laws. I have no problem keeping these stocked in the pantry for an occasional treat, and the kids have no problem eating them!

My only complaint is the original plastic 4Gb Cruzer version came with a detactable neck strap - nothing is included in the new Titanium 4Gb package. I miss this flexibility.

Sidebar: Something important to consider is data-security as I bought these Titaniums after I had lost my original 4Gb Cruzer - it contain a alot of personal data on it and I wished I had taken the time to password protect or encrypt it... luckily I found it 4weeks later.

Bought this little shaver several years ago in Berlin when BA lost my luggage in Heathrow. Still use it and love it. Use it for travel to bring in my carry-on luggage and still use it every day as it gets those areas which a large Panasonic (nice but more expensive) doesn't get. Only complaint: Replacement parts (foil and blade) cost as much as a new shaver. Not very sustainable for the environment but guess what. Ordered a new one and will keep the other one as backup/work shaver as it still works, only would like after 5 years or so to exchange the blade.
EDIT Since using it nothing to add other than in this newer model the long hair cutter is considerable smaller and sideways, rather than in parallel to the main one.

I bought this on a whim and did not realise its advantages at the time - but it is great!  The diaper compartment velcroes open so you can keep the top of the baby swaddled and warm while you change him - Jack loves that.  The 'Teddy Tabs' - bear-shaped velcro tabs - are adorable - we get so many complements on it.  Jack wiggles out of normal blankets.  Swaddling is recommended by SIDS organisations and to calm babies.  I often use this as a first layer and a couple of blankets wrapped around him when I'm carrying him in inclement weather (as the blankets inevitably loosen).  Definitely recommended.

This drive was so simple to set up! All I had to do was take it out of the box, plug the power in and insert it into the USB slot. I have had other external USB drives, but this one seemed to work the best. The Calvary 500GB external that I have, has had issues for a few months now where I can not reboot the computer with it on. It would just sit there with a red light on and not boot up at all. I end up having to power off the unit and then reset the computer and then it boots up. 
I've already copied over a good 450GB of music and photos that I've collected through the years and the drive seemed faster than my other external. In any case, I would highly recommend this for anyone in the market for an external.

Product looks good and works great. I had tons of trouble getting the product to work correctly due to my limited knowledge only. I've had a desktop computer for about 4 years now running on XP and it was my first computer - I'm almost 60 years old now. I decided to buy me a laptop with VISTA and learn the new operating system before the old one quits. No where did I see in the instructions that I had to hook up an ethernet cable to my laptop to setup and configure the router. I hooked it up to my desktop and configured it first. Did not work on Wi-Fi with my laptop.  Talked to Toshiba reps, Linksys reps etc. Spent hours on the phone going to different screens and typing in all kinds of IP's or whatever. I'm  a second grader when it comes to computers. From what I've read you don't even need to download the CD but please tell people to download it in their laptop and not their desktop. It dawned on me to do it that way this morning and it works just fine now and took about 5 minutes. From what I understand now the only WiFi computer that will work with my router is the one I have because of the security code. When I had first configured the router with my desktop my laptop was receiving an excellent signal from the router but could not connect because of the security key. Sorry about all the yapping in just a product rating forum. Still fun to learn with an older brain. First time laptop user with a touch pad, VISTA, and hooking up a router.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)

      



I have at least 3 Logitech mice around the house.  I have in the past stayed away from Microsoft for no other reason than it was not Logitech (Logitech customer support is also fantastic).  Getting a chance to examine the SideWinder X5 was an opportunity I didn't want to miss.  At the least, I'd get a chance to see if Microsoft measured up to Logitech quality wise.  

First off, getting the mouse out of its packaging proved easier than I thought.  For some this will hardly matter.  For me, not getting cut or exerting unnecessary energy and getting out my toolbox, in the process of opening up an electronics item I have purchased, is a big plus for the company.  

The mouse connects via USB.  My laptop with Microsoft Vista immediately found the necessary software and within 10 seconds I was able to use the mouse.  The mouse comes with a software disk and manual.  The software gives you access to the full capabilities of the mouse, which is what it was originally created for.  Overall, when not playing games, the mouse is easy to use, comfortable to hold, doesn't skip around, good sensitivity, and easily programmable.  It glides over a variety of surfaces so you can skip the mouse pad.  It does feel light and not very solid, but I'm not about to throw it at my wall.  Considering that some mice, i.e. from Logitech, cost about twice what the SideWinder is going for, I'd say you'd have a good investment on your hands if you purchased the X5.  Then again, the original SideWinder is selling for less than the X5, so give it some thought as to what you really want out of your mouse.  For example, you cannot change the weight here, as you could/can with the original SideWinder.

This was a very witty approach to an all too serious topic. I laughed out loud many times but also was reminded of the frustratingly narrow thinking of still too many folks who are religious. Of course I realize as I'm sure Bill does that many people of "faith" are not so irrational as some of the characters of this film. This documentary, however, does illustrate how religion can inspire dreadful behavior. You won't want to miss the deleted scenes and monologues which include much material the film does not. I'm hopeful this encourages more mainstream representation of the skeptical viewpoint. Until now, few were willing to point to the "elephant in the room" which is the root of most of our problems rather than being the answer!

I have been using Pampers diapers for my daughter since she was born. She is now 3 and I am still using them for her though hopefully she will be potty trained soon! 

I am very impressed with the quality of Pampers products. They are soft and never leave any kind of marks on her. They have never leaked either. The sizes are great - especially the size 6 in cruisers and the baby dry. She has been wearing those for quite a while and there is still plenty of room. I did try another name brand with her from a sample I received but they leaked and caused a diaper rash which she has never had with the Pampers. 

I would recommend Pampers to any new parent, they are worth the extra they cost.

I purchased this camera for multiple uses.  I wanted a HD camera that would take great family movies at holidays and birthdays, but also a good camera to do video podcasts with.  This camera fills the bill on both counts.  With the external microphone input, it's easy to hook up a lapel mike or a wireless mike.  The camera was easy to learn to use and with the removable SDHC card, it's a snap to transfer movies to your computer. 
The software that is included with the camera is a little clunky at best, but is a good starting point.  I didn't use it very much, since I already own Cyberlink's Power Director.
I purchased the HF100 instead of the HF10 because of the price difference.  I couldn't see paying more for the internal memory feature when you have to manually switch between the internal and external memory.  
I give this camera a great bit "ATTABOY"

An illuminating sadness punctuates the pauses of a festive worldly gathering in Jonathan Demme's "Rachel Getting Married", a cinematic tour-De-force that throws itself into the Oscar game from far left field. It's the best and most fulfilling film I've seen at the movies this year so far. 

The plot is simple. Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt), the oldest, most idolesque of the children in her family, is getting married. For the occasion her troubled younger sister Kym (Anne Hathaway) is given a weekend pass from rehab to attend the ceremony. Rachel and Kym, a former model and certified drama queen, tackle and tumble for the spotlight, only to reopen deep wounds and a tragic family history. 

I know, your probably going "I've seen it before. It was only last year. But it was called "Margot At the Wedding", and it really wasn't all that good!" And you might be right about obvious plot similarities, but you'd be neglecting one fact that excludes every like minded movie done before it: this is unmistakably a Demme picture.

After a decade spent swimming around mostly in music documentaries ("Heart of Gold", "Storefront Hitchcock"), Demme marries his on-the-fly live-concert approach with the sharp focus on human character that's been the bold definition of his work since "Melvin and Howard". Scenes grab for melancholy and laughs in the same breath. Music is a counterpoint to Kym's downward spiral, and Oscar nominated legends like Debra Winger share the screen with old Demme buddies Robyn Hitchcock, Sister Carol East, and Tunde Adebimpe from TV on The Radio. 

Like "Beloved", "Silence of The Lambs", and "Philadelphia", this film is a veritable acting powerhouse. Everything you've heard about Anne Hathaway's performance as Kym is true. Her well-crafted train wreck is heading straight for an Oscar nomination. Although Winger's screen time is short, her performance as Kym's mother, a woman grown frozen with rage and denial, deserves a supporting nom, just for a baity cat-fight scene with Hathaway alone. She brings an epic fiery resentment to the picture at just the right moment, and her aged-sexiness make her totally believable as this girl's mother.

But the film's biggest surprises are the unknowns: TV actress DeWitt and stage actor Bill Irwin, as Kym's sensitive father Paul. Both deliver subtle work, steady ballasts to the volatility of mother and black-sheep daughter. DeWitt is superb as the sibling who is willing to overlook the past if her sister might be simply willing to concede for a day (in more ways than one). Irwin is the man who's seemingly recovered, with a beautiful new wife and a home that seems to bristle with unrelenting life, but who still keeps artifacts of the dead unconsciously in full view. A scene between Irwin and Tunde, in which they have a competition to load a dishwasher (!)could be the film's most exciting and devastating moment.

Visually, "Rachel Getting Married" is unlike any Demme film seen before. Working with Jim Sheridan's verite'-trained cinematographer Declann Quinn, Demme constructs an intimately beautiful home video tapestry akin to the Dogme staples "Breaking The Waves" and "The Celebration", as much to the films of Robert Altman. Conversations bob and weave into one another in a sort of gritty poetic-realism where sunlight dances with unwanted shadow. And it's the most vibrant film of the year....the music never stops, as Rachel's wedding practically becomes the Jonathan Demme curated Summer Music Fest. (and we're all invited!).

Lastly, we must not forget the film's most sly, important and (seemingly) invisible element, Jenny Lumet's original screenplay. A vital new talent has been born folks, as the woman is blessed with the ear of everyday dialogue and the intrigue and nuance that underlays it. The acting is spectacular, but this script is so strong that I could envision say Natalie Portman and Elizabeth Reaser in the Kym and Rachel roles, and this film might still have equal power. It's just that good.

For my best picture of 2008, this one will be very, very hard to beat. See it while you can!

Rather than regurgitate what everyone else has said already, let me put it plainly:

The picture quality of the videos from this camera are so beautiful, so full of detail that it looks like a moving photograph. You can see the hairs on your childrens head, the texture from their sweater, the grains of sand stuck to their toes, the water drops landing on their face from the sprinklers...

Even before The Dark Knight opened in theaters, it had taken on a macabre mystique. Heath Ledger's untimely death and glimpses of his makeup and performance created part of a box office draw rarely equaled in motion picture history. But not even the trailers and TV ads could prepare audiences for Ledger's inspired and disturbing performance. The previous incarnation of the Joker, played by Jack Nicholson, was nothing but a violent, hyperactive clown. Nicholson overplayed the role and made the character conform to his larger-than-life persona. But Ledger nailed the real essence of the Joker and bore no resemblance to Nicholson's caricature. The Joker of The Dark Knight is not a simple murderer and bank robber. His goal is to inspire evil in others so that even the most law abiding citizen will be driven to commit acts of crime or murder.

At any opportunity, the Joker tries to drive crime fighters toward crime by sowing the seeds of terror and chaos. He allows himself to fall into a police trap so that he can spring a more diabolical plot. He arranges to have two ferries full of passengers forced into committing mass murder against one another. He dresses restrained civilians as criminals so police will be responsible for murdering innocents. To portray such a character, Ledger adopted mannerisms that at times seemed insect-like, similar to Jeff Goldblum's performance in The Fly. At other times, Ledger's performance invoked Malcolm McDowell in A Clockwork Orange. But the combination of nihilism and violent eruption that defined the Joker was achieved purely by Ledger's own artistry and for that he should be considered for a posthumous Academy Award. Despite Christian Bale getting top billing, Ledger played a more important, challenging role in the film. Wayne is well defined from Batman Begins and the Joker is firmly established in the prologue, a bank heist in which all the accomplices are shot and the Joker issues his tenet, which is a twist on Nietzsche: "What doesn't kill you makes you stranger."

But the central character in The Dark Knight is neither the Joker nor Batman. It's Harvey Dent. The film follows the major changes that transform him from the public attorney into DC comic book villain Two-Face. The bulk of the character development focuses on Dent's complicated descent from a dedicated, fearless political figure, passionate about defeating criminals using the rule of law. This white knight of Gotham lives by his tenet, "you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain." Dent is able to achieve popularity and make good on his promise to put violent mafia figures behind bars mainly because Batman is willing to do the dirty work and get no credit for it. As Batman's success in the streets and Dent's success in the courtroom push the mob organizations into an increasingly small corner, the Joker appeals to the mob bosses and rallies them against Batman. In the ensuing chaos, it becomes clear that Dent lacks ethical principles. When he loses his girlfriend, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and damages half his face in one of the Joker's vicious schemes, Dent turns his back on the law altogether. With some words of inspiration from the Joker, Dent transforms himself into Two-Face. Dent had gone after criminals. But Two-Face preys upon cops, including Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), using a two-headed coin similar to the one Nolan and Bale used in The Prestige. Instead of magic tricks, however, Two-Face uses the coin to determine the fate of his victims.

The significance of the coin and of Dent's prophetic quote about becoming a villain is to show how easy it is to succumb to chance and chaos in the absence of real principles. One of the themes of The Dark Knight is to evaluate how different characters respond to the pressures of leadership and of fighting evil. Nolan hits upon a truth seemingly missed by the entire press corps: leaders must be willing to sacrifice their popularity to do what's right. This core message of The Dark Knight is demonstrated in a subplot about telecommunications surveillance taken right from the front pages of newspapers during the US debate about the Homeland Security Act of 2007. Bruce Wayne uses government contractors to build an advanced telecom technology that taps into ordinary cellphones to triangulate and illuminate the location of anyone in Gotham. The technology is the only way to locate and catch the Joker. But when Wayne Enterprises' most trusted official, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), finds out what Wayne is up to, he says that no man should have that much power and tenders his resignation.

Faced with an adversary who is threatening countless lives and the future of Gotham, Wayne understands the consequences if he doesn't do what's necessary to end the Joker's campaign of terror. Dent proves to be an unprincipled politician with a rotten core and no one but Wayne/Batman is willing to sacrifice popularity to win the fight against evil. Ultimately, Batman decides he must take the blame for the actions of Two-Face in order to defeat the Joker and restore faith to the people of Gotham. The decision has major consequences. Gordon ultimately describes Batman as, "not a hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector...a dark knight." Public perception is always secondary to Batman. His principles guide him to defeat evil and save lives, but the result is his loss of popularity and respect. Some things are more important than public perception.Approximating the viewing experience in IMAX theaters, the Blu-ray version of The Dark Knight shifts between 1.78:1 and 2.4:1 sequences, which is a tremendous asset in preserving the vision of the filmmaker and in attempting to get an IMAX-like experience in viewers' home theaters. The prologue, as well as other 1.78:1 sequences, appear with lifelike detail and good depth. Some have complained about the subtle use of edge enhancement as detracting from the overall picture quality, but I believe what they are seeing is an ever-so-slight glow effect that makes the bright areas of some scenes appear heightened. Deducting points for this type of brightness would be silly. Meanwhile, the black level is remarkable as it conveys all gradations of grey and retains very good definition. Since so much of the film has dark, dimly lit scenes, the inky blacks contribute greatly to the depth and weight of the picture.

So how does the resolution of the 2.4:1 content compare to the 1.78:1 picture quality? Believe it or not, the detail remains nearly consistent in both aspect ratios--there's just more presence in the scenes shot using the IMAX cameras. Non-IMAX sequences give up surprisingly little in definition. Perhaps the most extraordinary scene to view the differences is when Batman raids the high rise building in Hong Kong to extract Lau (Chin Han). In the full IMAX resolution, with much of the screen enveloped in deep black, Batman is shown perched above the city. He then descends through the air, breaking through the window nearby the desk where Lau is working and quickly dispatches Lau's body guards. Finally, as he holds Lau near the broken windows, both men are whisked out of the building by a floating device and a passing aircraft. The complicated, busy action coupled with poor lighting would be problematic if not for the detail delivered both by the 1.78:1 and 2.4:1 shots that make up the scene. While the IMAX picture is preferable because of a greater sense of depth and resolution, the 2.4:1 content shares its small, gentle grain and otherwise clean, highly detailed presentation. Some element of the grain has a digital sheen to it, but I cannot justify deducting a point or half-point for that. In keeping with the dark visuals, the sound throughout The Dark Knight is weighted toward the lower registers with heavy LFE content. While the audio across the dynamic range is delivered in good detail, with plenty of resolution, the Dolby TrueHD content is clearly bass-heavy. It doesn't have quite the 3D impact one might expect in an action movie, with very little content assigned assigned to the rear channels. But it is preferable to err on the conservative side than to have an overly aggressive surround soundstage where it is really not warranted. On the other hand, some multichannel audiophiles may nitpick that the surrounds are underutilized. The anchoring across the center channel delivers all the dialog, while the front left and right speakers provide the bulk of the score. The music by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is less thematic and more of a mood amplifier to make the story more hard-hitting. Aside from the sound effects and subwoofer content, the soundtrack mostly disappears in the action and visuals. Looking back on it, that is a unique accomplishment for an action film, to be such a visual work of art that one hardly notices the score as sound. While all detail of the dialog and music is clearly articulated across the front channels, it often sounds diminutive in comparison to deeper content.

Listen to the scene where Batman, Lt. Gordon and Dent have a rooftop meeting together. Gordon's and Dent's voices are perfectly reproduced, crisp and detailed, yet they sound slightly anemic compared to Batman's deeper, more open voice. While the audio engineering is actually very good, the bass emphasis can overshadow the more relaxed dialog, especially Gordon's voice. This is a minor complaint, as all dialog is plainly audible and every word and breath expertly recorded. And of course, the advantage of having a pronounced LFE channel is on display throughout The Dark Knight. Listen to the scene where the 18 wheeler flips over its horizontal axis--an impressive bit of stuntwork--creating a cacaphony of deep bass rumble, crashing steel and other sound effects. Explosions, breaking glass, gunshots and other effects are impressively engineered. The amazing feature of the Dolby TrueHD track is that nothing gets lost in the mix, regardless of the minimal use of surrounds.Warner's BD is a must-have for your collection. The film is truly unique and riveting, and Warner did a great job integrating the IMAX footage for 1080p. Highest recommendations.

My daughter is almost 4, has autism, and is showing no interest in potty-training.  I am so relieved to have found that Pampers has added a size to their line--at least for a while, I won't have to worry about her outgrowing the biggest size of diapers available for kids.  I read a review that questioned whether it really is bigger than a size 6.  I can see a difference in the sizes, and think Pampers is great for seeing the need and responding to it.

Lots of plusses:  It works and is attractive.  The charge is lasting longer than I expected it to, but I have only charged it once. 

I did not experience the problems most frequently reported by others.  This vacuum works very well; the "turbo" vacuum setting is somewhat louder but does not bother me at all.  I have not experienced any of the "down shifting" on the trim height dial due to pressure, as reported by others.  I even tried to get it to do this, and mine would not. It has an attractive design, which doesn't matter much to me but is an added plus that makes it more enjoyable to use. It works quite well without the comb housing to clean up the back of my neck between haircuts.

The negatives are minor, but are as follows:
 
My biggest peeve is that there is a little blue rectangular spring-loaded vaccum mouthpiece right in front of the blade, which sucks the hair into the vaccum.  I suppose something like this is necessary from an engineering point of view to get the vaccum to work effectively.  However, it seems that this also limits the ability of the hair to get to the blade from that direction, which limits the blade's effectiveness.  This is somewhat frustrating, as one has to go over the same areas more than I used to with my old similar model.  Also, it makes it hard to use the trimmer with the comb  housing off to trim the hair around my ear, which I like to do between haircuts.  I can do this if I use my index fingernail to carefully hold down the blue piece.  This puts my finger quite close to the blade and makes me a little nervous that I'm going to slice through my finger.

The comb attachment has a spring-loaded base feature. It just seems like something that will break at some point and adds no real functionality.

I agree the case is a bit lame; it could be more rigid or padded, but if you travel with it, just roll it up inside an item of clothing and it will very likely survive just fine.  The case should have separate compartments inside for the charger and the trimmer, so the plug doesn't scratch up the trimmer surface.

Before you scoff at this remark please consider the evidence placed before you that shows Sharon Valerii has in fact fulfilled all the requirements of the Messiah to become the Saviour of Mankind.

From the start Capricia 6 has been advising humanity that the Cylons are carrying out the will of God and thus prepared the way for the coming Messiah just like John the Baptist did for Jesus.

Jesus was immaculately conceived, and thus was born without blemish, so he could take the place of the sacrificial lamb and in so doing restore humanities relationship with God. Sharon Valerii was also immaculately conceived and thus was born without sin.

Like Jesus, Sharon was raised amongst humans until her true calling was revealed to her. She then demonstrated her true abilities and revealed openly her true nature, volunteering to be the first test on the Cylon detector and even telling the Chief she was a Cylon.

When Sharon became aware of the full nature of her calling she became incredibly distraught and desperately sought an alternative even trying to kill herself. Jesus equally, was terrified of the path set before him, begging God for an alternative and became so distressed he began sweating Blood.

Eventually both Sharon & Jesus realized the path set before them was the only true path and they accepted their true calling. Jesus entered the Great Temple in Jerusalem, but the Leaders did not welcome him as a King, in fact they were corrupt and Jesus rebuked them for making the Temple a den of money makers and prophesied the destruction of the Temple (the Wailing Wall is now all that remains after the Romans destroyed it). After demonstrating a miracle by destroying a Basestar single-handedly, Sharon brought down the man who most clearly stood for the corruption of humanity, Commander Adama. Yet despite shooting at point blank range she chose not to kill him.

Sharon was then betrayed by those she loved most, and by those who claimed to love her in return. They put her in chains, beat her, tortured her, derided her, denounced her, spat on her and eventually murdered her in cold blood. (No comparison to what happened to Jesus should be necessary).

For all this, Death could not contain her, and Sharon Valeri was resurrected. On being reborn, Sharon was not filled with hatred and disgust for those that had betrayed and murdered her. In fact quite the opposite, she was filled with compassion for humanity and working with her prophet, Capricia 6, embarked on a greater calling to save humanity.

She has left humanity her Spirit in the Body of the second Sharon, who is now guiding Commander Adama. Adama now shows a growing level of humanity as he slowly embraces the wisdom of Sharon. It is easy to see the similarity between Saul's conversion to the great apostle Paul, and Commander Adama's transformation.

So with this evidence before you will you accept Sharon Valerii for what she really is?

It's a film that stars a 12 year old girl who has a debilitating illness.  Her illness just happens to be vampirism.  As long as you accurately know what to expect going into this film, there is no way you can be disappointed.

I've never liked the vampire genre; I despise it, really.  I could not cite a single vampire film as one of my favorites before Let the Right One In.  But now, not only can I do that, but I can cite Let the Right One In as my favorite film, period.

I bought this product based on the reviews I've read.  It's easy to assemble and fold.  At first, we used the divider for our golden retriever puppy when she was 10 to 12 weeks old.

She sometimes gnaws on the bars but still no damage.

I purchased two. One for my wife and one for myself.
This pedometer is very easy to use and provides a wealth of information, also transferable to the home computer for producing graphs of the data for the doctor to evaluate. The pedometer does not require special treatment but can be carried in a pocket. It gives calorie information as well as distance and number of steps taken. Very worthwhile and well worth the cost. Amazon was great to deal with. So far they work fine. We use them everyday, all day.

I had been researching Keurig for months before I finally decided to order the B60.  I had not so great results with previous pod type coffee makers and found they made a very weak luke warm coffee.  During the week, I am the only one drinking coffee so I hate making a pot to have it sit there and get 'burnt'.  Plus, sometimes I want a cup of coffee in the late afternoon but again, I don't want to make an entire pot for one cup.  
I received my pot and at first it was really loud and leaked some water.  I contacted Keurig who said I had a defective machine (to the person who mentioned that theirs leaks, it shouldn't leak and you should exchange it) so I exchanged it.  Now I have no problems with the machine.  Yes, the pump is alittle loud, but not to the point that others have described it.  Plus, I had a pod type coffee machine a few years ago that was MUCH louder than this.
I have been using the middle cup setting (8oz?) and haven't had any issues of week coffee... but I have been using a stronger dark roast coffee.
All in all I love the machine so far.  Thanks!

This review is from: The Princess Bride (Special Edition) (DVD)

      



The 80s were a decade of big hair, loud colors, and unabashed tackiness that to someone that lived them, it seems inconceivable that anything classic could have come from them outside of Indiana Jones. However, this is the movie that has some of the most recognizable quotes and dialogue to this very day. This is one of those movies that no matter where you catch it on TV, you end up watching it, and loving it all over again.

Peter Falk plays the coolest grandpa ever, reading the story of the Priness Buttercup and her beloved Westley to his sick grandson, played by a very young Fred Savage. At first, disgusted at the "kissing parts" and reluctant to hear the tale, the young boy is soon entranced, just as we are, drawn into a tale of true love, high adventure, and laugh out loud comedy. 

The cast is promising, and it delivers. Cary Ewles is the perfect Westley, gorgeous and hilarious with his dead pan humor. Robin Wright is the perfect "princess bride", and her performance makes us all forget she was once on "Santa Barbara". From Billy Crystal and Carol Kane to Andre the Giant and Peter Cook, everyone delivers an outstanding performance, and Mandy Patinkin delivers an especially delightful performance as Inigo Montoya.

This is a timeless classic, of that there is no doubt, and I recommend that anyone buy it. I have yet to meet a person that did not thoroughly enjoy this movie.

According to Dr. Oz and You: Staying Young: The Owner's Manual for Extending Your Warranty (You), walking 30 minutes a day is a critical aspect of taking care of your body as well as working up to 10,000 steps a day ... so this was one of several products I purchased I as I implemented the Staying Young program.

This pedometer is much larger than any other pedometer I've owned (I've had a few over the years) and I don't particularly care for the size, but it wallops a great punch of features that have made it worthwhile ...

1.  This is the easiest one ever to set-up, read, review, etc.

2.  It can tell when you're 'walking around' versus 'really walking' -- It tracks all your steps regardless of intensity but it also and tracks a second category as aerobic steps (you just hit the lowest middle 'mode' button to read this subset information).  It also tells you distance and calories burned.

3. It resets itself to 0 every morning and has a seven day memory. 

4.  The belt clip that comes with it is secure and easy to use.

If you are making a commitment to better health and it involves a walking program of any kind, I think this would be a great enhancement to your commitment and success.

I received this from Amazon in record time and I tried it out on my two goldens.  It really does remove lots of hair but no more than my $9 rake did.  Not sure it is worth the hefty price tag but I will keep trying it for a while.  The hair does seem to brush out in longer strands than the rake and my dogs enjoy the brushing.

Season One of Battlestar Gallactica doesn't disappoint.

 It is riveting and the acting is well above average. You really care for the characters.My wife talked me into watching the mini-series and I was hooked,I usually watch detective shows (I'm still keeping up with Columbo and Kojak).
 
 The conflict between the Cylons and humans appears to have meaning beyond the theme of science gone astray---there is an interesting religious undercurrent.

 Ultimately ,BSG delivers what movies should do---it entertains and sustains interest. I'm looking forward to the arrival of the human survivors on Earth(whenever that happens).

I love this mixer.  It can handle heavy cookie doughs and looks beautiful on my kitchen counter.  The only fault I find with it is the speeds are to the back of the mixer not the front and it is a little inconvenient.  If they were on on the front along with the tilt head button it would be more convenient.  Amazon ships very fast.  I would recommend this product along with Amazon.

It is perfect for my 13lb dog - and we never have to worry about forgetting a bag.  Although sometimes we forget to refill the dispenser. I like to buy things in bulk and so this 120ct refill set is perfect, since we end up using about 2-3 every day.

I love the flip.  I have only used my regular camcorder about 15 times.  It is a real pain to transfer movies and the tapes have gotten eaten.  It is too big for me to lug around.  The flip just fits in our pocket.  I can take it with me everywhere and am not tied down to a large camera case.  I have been able to make dvd's using windows movie maker quite easily.  These have been as good of quality as my other camcorder even though I probably lose quality going to dvd.  I even let the kids use it while I am watching because it is light enough that they won't drop it.  I am very happy with our purchase.  It needs to have removeable memory and a removeable battery.  I figured that this will be good for a couple of years but an upgrade will be needed.  By then though maybe it will replace a point and shoot.  I am happy because I am not missing video of the kids while they are small.

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)

      



   Batman and company have been appearing in live-action adaptations through movies or tv for decades now, but 2005's Batman Begins (Two-Disc Special Edition) was the first (and long-awaited) appearance in live-action of a Batman and a Gotham City that resemble the comic book versions of the modern age.  "The Dark Knight" carries on this tradition, picking up about a year after "Batman Begins" with the Bat's war on crime in full swing and Carmine Falcone's once all-encompassing crime empire battered but plowing on.  Two major new forces enter in the form of new District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who's on his own full-speed-ahead crusade to clean up the city, and a madman clown calling himself The Joker (Heath Ledger, of course) who takes on good guys and bad guys alike in malicious glee.  Despite Joker's initial attacks on interests of the crime family, they end up taking him up on his offer for help against Batman because they feel the Bat poses the greater threat to their continued existance.  Joker's tactics wind up pushing Batman, Dent, and the GCPD closer to the edge.  Batman, Dent, and Jim Gordon - the three key figures in the battle to bring the city back from the brink it's been on for years - all wind up having to navigate situations where the line between right and wrong, and how to respond to different threats, isn't all that clear.

   Heath Ledger has justifiably gotten tons of praise for his portrayal of the psychotic Joker, and rightfully so - I feel it's equal to his performance in Brokeback Mountain (Widescreen Edition) - but the other performers have consequently gotten a little lost in the hype, and not gotten the credit they're do.  "The Dark Knight" features an outstanding ensemble cast, with Christian Bale making a great Batman, and Gary Oldman (Jim Gordon), Morgan Freeman (Lucius Fox), Michael Caine (Alfred Pennyworth), Maggie Gyllenhaal (replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes) and Eckhart (Dent) all bringing their characters to life.  This movie gives all the so-called 'supporting' characters, as well as the overall situation in Gotham, and the role of the city itself, important parts in building up the whole.  For a long time, I've felt that pretty much all modern comic book series are in reality ensemble books, with the character in the title (Batman, Superman, Hulk, whoever) being more the flagship character of the cast, instead of totally dominating things.  And "The Dark Knight" has done things that way too, has let different players and different facets of the story get good sceen time instead of just being the backdrop for Batman Vs. Joker.

  Visually, the film is incredible, and captures the comics's look incredibly - a couple of images look just like the photorealistic paintings of Alex Ross in a book like Justice, Vol. 1.  The action is fantastic and tense.  The look of the city, the design of the Batmobile, everything on this level has been expertly crafted.

  As for flaws?  There are very, very few.  Some might argue that the Joker is in some ways different from in the comics - i.e. he wears white face paint instead of actually being a death white, things like that.  I think the thing that mattered was that they really got the character's mindset right was what mattered - he's not, despite his name, supposed to be a 'comedic relief' character, and he's not simply a criminal mastermind with an outlandish costume.  He's a hyperviolent psychopath who's arguably the most totally devoid-of-conscience enemy Batman's ever faced, and this comes across on screen.  The exact specifics of his appearance, etc. have varied over the years, but what's important, whether it's in the comics, the movies or elsewhere, is to get the character's core right.  The way Batman's handled is also excellent, and he's certainly built up more convincingly than in most of the pre-2005 movies, although I did find one glitch - the scene in which he thwarts one of the Falcone family's henchmen by seizing the gun barrel and bending it back.  It's very important to remember that Batman does Not have superhuman strenth, nor does his armored costume give him any special 'powers'.  This kind of thing only happened the once so it's no big drawback, but it is something the filmmakers might want to be conscious of so it doesn't get out of hand next time around.

  It certainly doesn't take away from the movie being one of the year's best though.  And without giving anything away, the ending only makes one more eager for the next chapter.  A+

I usually scribble out a few thousand words for the bulk of my reviews, but I really don't feel it necessary for this film. I'll try to be brief.

I'll be honest and admit that several times during the film, I considered that it wasn't as good as the first film, but then the longer it progressed, the more I began to wonder if I was being drug into a bear-trap device against my will. What I mean was that, somewhere, I suspected that something darker was going on below the surface, which wasn't obvious - which is a good thing, because by the time the ending wrapped up I got that incredibly overwhelmed sensation of tingling run down my spine like a chill realizing that I - only now, fully understood. And I think that was the way it was meant to be grasped. I also think that's what a lot of other folks saw in this film as well.

Watching, I wondered what a lot of the elements had to do with each other, why did we have to wrap up business with `The Scarecrow', why did they have to keep mentioning `Falconi' and his influence, why did Bale's Batman now seem completely detached, emotionally void and at times robotic? Why were some of the fight scenes `rough' and lacking flair, looking too much like a `real' fight scene? Why was Bale growling his dialogue and now gaunt, unlike the fleshy faced Bale of `Begins' and `The Prestige'?

Then as everything came to a close, again, I understood. I understood just what was going on with the actual development of the character and not just artificial development that comes off as trite, like Tony Stark sobering up from a long night of partying, no ... nothing like that at all. This was actual real, flesh and bones story-telling of some of the best caliber.

Christopher Nolan goes against the grain by offering up something as grand as this in a serialized, comic-book action movie and making something vastly superior to a lot of other `dramatic' films in the market. With an intensely obscene budget of $185 million, the film pulls no punches.

But maybe like Gordon said, maybe this is the Batman that's needed for these times and in this circumstance. Not a hero, but a protector, a guardian ... a dark knight.

Some are upset, again, that Christopher Nolan fails to deliver a Director's Commentary, but I don't think he ever will. I firmly believe `The Prestige' is a modern day masterpiece much in the same line as Blade Runner, and we were left dangling without a commentary on that, I didn't expect to see one here, but I guess a lot of other people did.

Last -- The Blu-Ray version of this movie is everything that modern technology have it hyped up to be. The image is superior and superb. the sound is magnificent, devilish and crisp. And if you're not satisfied, adjust your set or your receiver because it seems no expense was spared in the mastering of this product. It's the pinnacle of viewing at this point.

I use this drive with my WD TV HD Media Player. It's fast enough via USB for video etc. However, file transfers aren't the fastest. My Western Digital USB drive writes much faster via USB than this one. Not sure why. 

The drive barely gets warm when operating, and it's a very quality structure/enclosure. The Leather casing it's housed in gives a nice touch. 

One small detail... Avast recognized the RECYCLER software pre-installed on this drive as Malware. I formatted as soon as I plugged it in though, so no worries. I'm thinking Avast gave a false positive for whatever reason.

For the price, (I paid seventy shipped) it's well worth it.

Woody Allen has written and directed another European based film that feels like a view across the pond toward America: Allen is still Allen, but with the comparison of European attitudes with American narcissism makes this little film a bit more bitter than most of his others.  As with most of Allen's movies, as fine as they are there are usually some annoying elements.  In VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA that element is in the presence of an unseen narrator (Christopher Evan Welch) who provides the bridges among the various aspects of the film, bridges that in the presence of such a fine cast are unnecessary in fleshing out the characters and their odd situations.

Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are best friends who have elected to spend a summer in Barcelona: Vicky intends to pursue her studies of Catalan art and architecture while Cristina needs to recover from her completion of a disappointing 12 minute film.  Vicky is a pragmatist engaged to a 'good prospect' named Doug (Chris Messina)  while Cristina longs for the unusual - something that will fill the gap in her perception that she is without talent.  The two girls meet a famous artist Juan Antonio Gonzano (Javier Bardem) who, recovering from a strangely abusive marriage to the flamboyant Maria Elena (Pen閘ope Cruz), puts the make on the two girls for a m閚age a trois. Vicky is disgusted, Cristina is fascinated and somehow the trio is off for a wild weekend that turns into a strange interplay of even stranger personality types. Juan loves both, beds both, and problems arise - especially when his still beloved tempestuous Maria Elena arrives on the scene.  Just about every variation of relationships is explored during this film with the audience more than willing to go along with the twists and turns that never cease to surprise and entertain.

Once again Javier Bardem proves he is one of our strongest actors on the screen and Pen閘ope Cruz lights up the story like a rocket.  Watching them both is reason enough to see this film.  As for the script, Allen allows each of the characters to reference an aspect of Allen's own quirks, and in the end we have indeed heard yet another diatribe of how Woody Allen sees himself and the people who enter his sphere.  The film is colorful, rich in fine music, and blessed with an impeccable cast.  If it just didn't superimpose that narrator as a tour guide....Grady Harp, January 09

The Secret is pretty much about positive thinking/law of attraction. Humans are made up of energy and our thoughts send out a frequency. Whatever you visualize(transmit)...you will attract it. The Secret was a good refresher for me because in this world of chaos i feel like i put too much energy into thinking about the daily stress of my life, what i don't want, etc. The Secret helped to shift my thinking and remind me what i need to focus on. Be grateful for what you have, think positive thoughts even when you're down, have an open mind and know that you ultimately are the one in control of your life.

I was very apprehensive about buying this netbook. A lot of people said not to waste my money on something so small! Well, after doing tons of research, reading review after review, and trying out other laptops and netbooks, I tookthe leap and bought the Asus on Amazon. Needless to say , I am not disappointd.
   I use this handy little machine for school ( I am a nursing student) for taking notes in class. I was worried at first because my classes are small and I didn't want some huge machine whirring through the lectures. Not a problem here,the Asus runs very quietly and the only disruption is everyone complimenting me on my nifty little computer! The battery life is not really at the advertised 7 hours, but with the wifi turned off an dthe screen brightness turned down, I can get more than 5 hours. That gets me through all of my morning lectures with no problems.I also find that takingnotes this way is far more effective than handwriting, and I am not the fastest typist: ) 
   This netbook is a great little machine! The screen is bright, clear and I love that it doesn't have a glossy screen ( however the outside case is a smudgy mess! not a deal breaker). The software included isn't bad, I like that it has Windows Xp and not Vista ( for obvious reasons ) and Microsoft works is fine for my purposes. 
   All in all , this is a great buy for someone looking for a supplemental computer. Respect that it has its limitations ( no cd/dvd drive, smaller hard drive, and smaller processer, etc ) and you won't be disappointed!

I have six cats and the oldest isn't really happy with all the new additions. Using Feliway has been a big help. It has stopped him from spraying when he got mad at us for bringing in others. I have two units in my house, at one time I had three plug-ins and tried to only have one, but that didn't work. Wish it wasn't so costly, but it works. Don't buy in a local pet store, they charge almost double. Buy on-line.

If you liked Twilight and wasn't as excited about New Moon,  you will love Eclipse.  There's love (of course), vampires, werewolves, and a series of killings.

What's nice about this one is that both Edward and Jacob are present.  Although quite different, both add interesting elements to the story and the Bella/Edward/Jacob triangle.  The reader learns more of the werewolves and the stories of some of the vampires.  Finally, Bella realizes things aren't as simple as 'happily ever after' if she becomes a vampire.  Funny thing is, as immature as Jacob can be, it is their relationship that causes Bella to grow up a little and think things thru a little more than just 'me & Edward' - something Edward's been trying to do since book 1.

For me, Edward is the character than draws me into the story.  Meyer does an excellent job of conveying Edward's wit and charm in his behavior and dialogue as in Twilight.  Although his love for Bella can sometimes make him come across as a little weak or pathetic, this is simply because of his struggle in realizing he can't give Bella somethings he wishes he could or that he feels she needs.  The scene in the woods when it is Jacob's body heat that protects Bella is a clear indicator of this.  Edward comes across as the 'bigger person' throughout this novel understanding that Jacob was there for Bella when he wasn't.  Eclipse continues building on the relationship between Bella/Edward/Jacob and finally forces Bella to make a decision.

Since buying the FryDaddy Electric Deep Fryer my cooking has changed drasticly.  Many meals are cooked completely in this deep fryer, without having the range, oven or other appliances turned on at all.  The taste of frozen french-fries cooked in thia deep fryer, rather than having them dried out and hard from being cooked in the oven, is indescribable.  And fish and shrimp are fantastic when fried this way.  It makes me wonder why I delayed cooking this way for so long.  I wouldn't be without it!

I bought my first Brew N Go years ago, and am buying my FOURTH now.  It's the best thing that ever happened to my coffee, or my tea for that matter.  It brews a great cup of tea, if you put the tea bag directly in the brew basket, and press it down so the exit hole is covered.

I drink one cup of coffee a day.  This coffee maker makes a perfect cup every time.  Non-coffee drinking people can even do it, which just isn't true with most coffee makers.

I suggest it for any household that likes really fresh coffee, not just one-drinker households, because every cup is hot and fresh.  I love that I can make guests their own brewed-to-order cup, stronger or weaker, even use different coffees for different people.  Also, it's so much nicer than those machines which require you to use "pods"... what choice in coffee do you have if you have one of those machines?  I certainly wouldn't be able to find my organic free-trade coffee in a pod.

I do not use the permanent filter that comes with the machine, I buy #1 unbleached filters at the grocery store. I've never found a permanent filter that made coffee I liked, and unfortunately this one is no exception.

We have had large and medium sized Coolaroos out in our dog run for several years now. They are the perfect solution for your dog's comfort outdoors. The dogs love them and it keeps them off the wet, cold concrete. As long as you don't have a puppy that wants to chew, this product will last a long time out in the elements. Our puppy chewed ours, but what can you expect...he was chewing everything. Now he is out of that phase and is leaving the Coolaroo alone (except to sleep in it!). 

In response to some previous reviews, you can find replacement covers for these beds at several other online merchants if you just spend a minute or two searching. Admittedly, these beds are a little tough to get the last bolt in place. That is the point though- the mesh fabric initially has to be very tight. As soon as the dog lays in the bed for the first time, the fabric loosens a bit and it is perfect.

I loved this book! It was my favorite of all four. I loved seeing Bella, and Edward grow up. It showed a natural progression of what love really is. It is so sad that in todays society young people think that they can have relationships and sex without any commitment to one another. The way Bella and Edward stayed commited to each other, got married before having sex was a great message. I hate that so many fans are upset about the baby. Bella was freaked out when she found out. Of course she didn't use birth control, because they all thought that pregnancy was inpossible. It was a fantastic twist, and a wonderful surprise. No one predicted this! My favorite quote was when Bella described her heart growing when she realized she was going to have a baby. That was the perfect quote of what motherhood is all about. I always thought that Bella would make Edward a little bit mortal. And she did with their daughter.

The software works fine as far as I've been able to see on Vista x64. There are no driver issues because it uses the standard Human Interface Driver (the one used for Keyboards and Mice)

The software also gives you many different views of the BP readings, the hard part is going to be picking one out to print for your doctor. but it is very nice to have many different graph views

I have been using Gillette ever since the Mach 3 product came out. The Mach 3 was a revolutionary idea at the time. It gave me much better shaves than Norelco or those horrible BIC shavers. Now with the Gillette fusion, I get better shaves and a long lasting blade. I shave in the shower because the wet hair is easier to shave than dry hair. I also use the tip of keeping the blade in down so gravity draws everything away from the blades. A really great product and system from Gillette.

This flash drive works very well, with fast transfer speeds and quick dismounting.  It doesn't come with any programs that launch automatically (an annoying feature of some drives, even on Macs).  In short, this is fine and fast flash drive.

"Dexter" is more evidence that networks like SHOWTIME, HBO, and now even AMC are consistently able to deliver well-written, well-performed, and well-edited television drama in a way that networks like CBS and NBC just seem not to be able to do.

There is a complexity to this program that is very engaging.  I like excellent programming and "Dexter" delivers.

Moonlight was the BEST show on TV in years!!! 
I can't believe it was cancelled even though there are millions of fans out there.... 
I can highly recommend Moonlight for anyone who likes suspense, drama, vampires, and above all an amazing love story with the best chemistry ... a chemistry between the two lead actors that is so good that you will be blown away... ... 
So enjoy! and Warner Brothers better get their act together and release Moonlight on DVD!!!

I love poached eggs in the morning, and use hard cooked eggs for everything from egg salads to potato salads.  This is my third egg cooker in the span of 20 years, and I am very happy with it.  Excellent design, easy to use and clean, and so far, very reliable.  Also, I appreciate not having an obnoxious beeper to tell me when my eggs are done.  I hope to use this appliance for many years to come.  Having a non corrosive surface, and built in measuring for water are clear improvements for the user, yet many egg cookers don't incorporate these features.  This is by far the best egg cooker I've encountered.  Can poach up to 4 eggs at a time.

I bought this bread machine from Amazon because it was on sale for $69 about two weeks ago.  That seemed like a good price for what looked like a decent machine, so I ordered it. I'm so glad that I did!  I have made six loaves so far, all of which have come out perfectly.  I tried two other machines before this model, both of which burnt or did other crazy things to the loaves and so required tons of monitoring  and adjustments.  With this machine, though, it really IS as easy as throwing a few ingredients in the machine and pressing a button! So far I have made french bread, whole wheat bread, brown rice flour bread, irish potato brown bread, and more.  The recipes that came with the machine work well, but I also picked up a few bread machine cookbooks for more variety. 

In addition to making great bread, I love how quiet the machine is (like another reviewer, I kept checking to see whether it was working the first time).  I also like  that it's a little smaller than equivalent 2 lb. machines and so easily fits under kitchen cabinets, and I love the way it looks in my kitchen (it's not a huge, hideous white box!). There's a helpful fruit/nut add-in beep, the shape of the loaf is nicer than the other 2 machines I've used, and the finished bread easily slides out of the pan.

Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase.  5 stars!

Added 10/25/2007:
I am still so happy with this bread machine, so I had to come back and add to my review.  Since I bought this more 6 months ago I have been using it often (at least 1 loaf a week) and I have never had a failure yet.  In addition to loaves made with bread flour, I have made many loaves with 100% whole wheat flour (the majority of my loaves are 100% whole wheat) or other flours like spelt, rice, and oat, and all loves came out beautifully.  This machine produces perfect, perfect bread!  I now bring fresh bread to every dinner party I attend, and people are always so grateful.

In addition to homemade bread being delicious, I think it's much healthier, too: I love that I now know exactly what went into every loaf of bread I eat (i.e. no weird chemicals or additives, I can decrease the sugar or replace it with a natural sweetener like maple syrup, etc.).  I would give this machine 10 stars if I could, I love it that much.

One helpful tip someone gave me was to buy The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook by Beth Hensperger.  I use recipes from this book every time I bake bread, and they always come out beautifully.  I'm sure there are lots of other good bread machine cookbooks, but this is by far the best one I've tried.

This is a great USB flash drive. It provides 4 GB of capacity in a small package. The USB port retracts into the device to prevent damage and to take up less space. The U3 software is a nice feature that allows you to run applications off of your flash drive rather than off of the host computer. This is convenient if you are constantly using different computers, because all of your settings are saved on the drive.
A great product for a great price.

I bought my MBP on Amazon last July and up to now I am ecstatic with it's results. I have read extensively around the web for user reviews and experiences and although some negative ones made me frown I went ahead and bought one. After years of PC use and a lot of frustration because of crashes (especially with graphic design programs I use) I saved up the (chunk of ) money and bought the MBP.

I have worked with Mac's previously but that was such a long time ago that when I first turned on my MBP and saw the bright screen and colors and the power this machine has while I run heavy software, listen to music AND watch videos, it just blew me away! Apart from me being a specific user because of my line of work I think this MBP is also very suitable for less higher end user, although maybe the price could be an obstacle for buying one. Still it is worth every penny in my humble opinion.

Can't wait to see what the rumored new batch of MBP's will bring, and well hope I will not be tempted to upgrade this one myself. I'm a fan!

After owning the B60 for six months now, I enjoy it more and more each week. I always now go straight home instead of stopping on the way at that $tarmoney place because this coffee is so good. If you like it strong I also recommend the 'Coffee People Bold Black Tiger' from Amazon.

I also got the 'Keurig My K-Cup Reuseable Coffee Filter' so I can experiment with some of the local specialty coffees for much less than K cup cost. BUT, the K cup sure is convenient.

I agree the unit is a bit loud, but it is in the same room as the dishwasher so I don't mind.

This thumb drive works great but does not run as fast as the GB version from Transcend. So if your looking to use ready-boost on your vista machine it would be better to get the smaller faster drive. Ready-boost can only use GB of space to speed the system up anyways so with this GB version you get 4 GB to boost and 4 for storage... but it is slower. Transcend makes a good product and the price was right but I had to take a point away for speed.

If you want to make frozen drinks, shakes, etc. this blender rocks!!! Give it 5 seconds- tops- and you will not find a single, tiny piece of ice left in there.  

It's unbelievable!  I can't recommend it enough. 

If you want it for other uses, I can't speak for that.  I mostly use it to make drinks. 

PS- don't waste your money on the cheaper blenders that claim they can crush ice.  I had to learn the hard way.  The one I got before this one was a joke.  You could smell the motor burning up from the first time I used it.  I was afraid it would start a fire and chucked it.  Total waste of money.

I just want to say that yes i agree it isn't all that exciting hen they all get what they want in the end but i loved every second of this book; i always wanted to love jacob but was fighting it so hard because he kept trien to take bella away from edward and well i am completely in love with the character of EDWARD CULLEN he is the best male character ever to me the only one who ever comes even close is Tristan from the Tristan and Isolde. I do not believe that edward is too perfect like lots of people have said but he is incredible in all that he does and just because of what he is and how he and all his family work so hard to be so good to have some humanity, but edward is just great beyond that even carlisle thinks so.  anyway back to the point i was very happy that edward and jacob bonded and became like family that way i could love jacobs character they way it deserved to be loved.  i loved how bella and jacobs relationship and the ties they felt for each other were never really more than friends it just seemed it to keep them with each other until renesmee was finally there, jacobs true other half.  thats they way i took it anyay, cause not just jacobs feelings for bella went away when he imprinted but bellas for him too.  IT WAS FATE!!!!!  it wasn't like that with sam and leah when sam imprinted emily he didn't love leah like that anymore but she still loved him.  Anyway yes everyone got what they wanted and no one died butthey all deserved it.  Especially Edward and Jacob.

This is truly a family movie that all will enjoy from six years old to 90. Something you can watch together, laugh about, talk about and enjoy over and over again. I'm so glad Amazon has this available. When I switched from VHS I was concerned I wouldn't be able to get it on DVD.

We use it to keep our Yorkie puppy in when we are not home during the day. Works great. Puppy has room to move about but is kept away from furniture and woodwork. Also, it has been a great help with house breaking - when in the pen the puppy always uses the training pads. Amazon was the best price. Highly recommend this product.

I have had the Omega Paw RA20 rolling litter box for more than a month, and it's working really well.  I have two cats, and there is no more scooping, no more litter tracked all over the floor.  You just roll the box one way and the clumps fall into the removable tray, then roll it the other way to settle the cleaned litter back into the box.  Remove the tray and dump it - easy!  The only thing I need to get used to is the level of litter in the box - at first I had too much, and it was hard to roll the litter box because of the weight of the litter.

I really like this product, and the cats took to it right away.

I purchased this Keurig system as a gift for my wife as an alternative to using my drip coffee maker to quickly brew her tea. She was getting coffee flavored tea and I was getting tea flavored coffee. What a great compromise this system is. The system purges itself between brew cycles so you do not get that "carryover" into the next cup. We find that sampling the large selection of teas and coffees along with hot cocoas available to be fun. Our friends and neighbors enjoy being offered a wide range of hot drinks too. Thankfully, my wife is very good about sharing her "gift"!

I've carried a Flip in my bag for over a year now and was looking for something similar but HD. I saw this camera on the CES blogs, thought it looked great and, unlike the other reviewer, I associate Sony with good quality product (esp when it comes to imaging) so decided to get one.

Holding the camera is a little awkward for long periods but I have a gorilla mount that I attach, and hold it so that the camera is on a stick if I need to. The video quality is excellent in good light and, in my opinion, more than adequate indoors. 

I'm not looking for TV quality video from this camera, it sits in my bag and I shoot from the hip. In this capacity I think you cannot go wrong. Makes my Flip look sadly very inferior, and I adore my Flip.

There is a reason why professionals prefer to use Kitchenaid Stand Mixers. They are simply the best. This is not only an appliance that will last a lifetime, it is a beautiful addition to any kitchen decor. I loved mine so much I bought one for my sister as a housewarming gift.The mixer is fun and easy to use. I love making cookies and cakes in it, and pizza dough takes about 2 minutes to make with the dough hook. I don't recommend making pie crusts or biscuits in it though, some things just must be made by hand or they will be overworked and tough. But I don't buy pre-made cake frosting anymore. It's too easy to whip up something in the kitchenaid, and it tastes better too.I would think that the only people who wouldn't like this excellent piece of equipment are those who really don't cook or bake much anyway. For everyone else, do yourself a favor and get one!

I bought myself the 711 AC and rated it 4 1/2 stars. The 712 is about $8 cheaper, maybe more. I had the 711 checked by medical staff and they found it to be accurate. My internist only recommended five BP Cuffs,
three being Omron.  This is the best deal. Easy to use. Takes up little
space. Accurate. Fits smoothly on most biceps with the regular cuff. 
Reliable. This can easily last 5-8 years and stay accurate. Operates on
battery or AC.  I highly recommend this basic model for anyone who
believes in preventive health care or wants to monitor their own health

I typically write only good reviews.  I investigate before I commit to reading something, so I typically like it, and thus, good reviews.  This guy's book/system is beyond good.  It's simple to understand, it doesn't take a lot of discipline to incorporate, and it works so flawlessly.
1. Get ALL the stuff out of your head;
2. Process it in a system that you trust;
3. Do the things that yield return, with the preface that you can only do single "next actionable items," not projects.  Projects are a sequence of next-actionable items (Big difference).

They should probably tag this with ADD and ADHD; I have a few friends who suffer from this affliction who would probably have life-changing experiences with this system.

I bought this waffle maker for my wife who LOVES Belgian Waffles.  Since then neither she nor I have been disappointed with the purchase.  As mentioned by some other reviewers, the best waffles are made with the heat on the highest level.  As an aside: the recipes that accompanies the waffle maker taste good but are tidiest to make and do not (in our opinion) taste as good as some off the shelf mixes.  If asked if I would make the purchase again for the same money, I'd do it again in a heart-beat.

I purchased the WGR614 a few weeks ago along with a WGE101 wireless bridge for my Turtle Beach Audiotron digital audio receiver.  The performance of both products has been rock solid. I'm running 3 computers through the ethernet and two wireless devices. Plus this thing costs half as much as the comparable Linksys product. The only thing I don't like is the support.  When I've emailed, it took several days to get an automated response to a question that is not even to close to what I really asked. I haven't tried to call yet.  Also the manual indicated that you could shut off the SSID broadcast, but infact you can't unless you upgrade the firmware to the newest beta version.  I did that and everything is working fine.The only other problem that I've experienced is that I can't use my employer's VPN.  My own internet and network sharing works fine, but for some reason I can't use the VPN. The instructions state that shutting of the SPI firewall would solve this, but it doesn't.  This was not a problem with my comparable Linksys product.

I had a very nice computer with two hard drives on a very expensive surge protector, but a Pelican landing on a power line and stretching it's wings from one terminal to the other ( while I was working on the PC )killed both hard drives. I lost everything because it never occurred to me that anything like this would happen. At worst I thought one or the other HD might go, but...

Anyway I bought this a month ago and it's great. I turn it on to do back ups, and shut if down and unplug it when it's not in use. Making it a an inexpensive safe easy reliable way to back up my doc's, e-mail, pic's, music and video files. I also use San Disk Flash Memory sticks as a second back up, just in case. But the method I had been using for the past 10 or so years just blew up in my face ( running two hard drives one for daily use, the other as a daily backup ). But now I run a daily back up to this drive and feel sure that I have developed a bullet proof system to protect my most important files.

So I would recommend this to anyone who wants an inexpensive easy and portable back up your most important material.

I'm going to be buying another one of these at this price. I bought mine on a Black Friday Super saver deal somewhere else and paid 10 bucks more than this.
For your infomation these Calvary Drives have Western Digital Cavair drives inside, 72,000rpm SATA. Comes with all the cables you need. Hooking up the eSATA was a breeze and that was my main reason for buying this drive. eSATA blows USB away. My little 80GB internal drive was almost full (74GB), so I bought this to store all my movies & TV shows I've downloaded onto and I started dragging and dropping folders with full TV seasons on them (14 episodes +/- ). I transferred the whole batch in less than an hour and that was 30 different folders. It was literally as fast as I could dragem and come back with another they'd be done. I did do a test with the drive using the USB connection and I drag/dropped an episode of Enterprise in a little over 3 minutes, when I D/D the same file using the eSATA it took 22 seconds. I'm really impressed by the speed of this drive.
The drive is so quiet I wouldn't know it was on if not for the Blue light in the front and there is a switch on the back if you want to turn it off. It does have a fan inside too, because when I put my hand in front of it you can feel the cool air coming out the little slots above and below the Blue light. The drive stays cool as can be even when I was slamming it with folders or when I'm playing a movie from it onto my 22" monitor. I use this with my Main Rig that runs on XP Pro, but I've taken it to work and used it with my Vista machine and there's no problems at all. The drive comes preformatted in NTFS instead of FAT 32 which is sweet. (thats also why you won't see the full 500GB, I got 465GB) I do have a friend who did reformatted his to FAT32 and he's got 496.8GB. But hey I'd rather have the NTFS anyday.
Bar none this is the Best deal out there for an External drive and its kinda funny that these are cheaper than the Western Digital My Books that have the same drives inside and all the My Books I've run into tend to run kinda hot. You won't rest your hand on the top of one for long, trust me I did and I about burnt the palm of my hand.

In response to "Alex",
 
1. It's a matter of personal opinion. I think the filming style works very well and it's never caused me to feel nauseous even though I suffer from motion sickness in real life.

2. No, the writers did not pull the pregnancy out of their butts. Six mentions in one of the first few episodes that she wants a baby. Please give examples of the other supposed plot holes.

3. The characters are unemotional? I don't know how you define emotion but most people define it as when a person exhibits joy, grief, love, fear, etc.. There is a lot of that on this show. I would go so far as to say the characters show more emotion than on any other show on TV (maybe with the exception of Lost). 

4. Actually the music on this show is outstanding. I highly recommend the Battlestar Galactica soundtrack. 

7. When exactly does Roslin do "stupid, moralistic crap to protect her own butt"? Provide some examples. And there is no Admiral on the show in the first season. 


As for the show being cancelled: Not likely. It's the highest-rated show on the Scifi channel (although not by a big margin) and the DVDs seem to be selling very well. Also, this show is Scifi's only source of critical acclaim, I doubt they want to give up all the positive attention. Time Magazine, Newsday, Boston Globe, Boston Herald, USA Today, TV Without Pity, etc. have high praise for the new Battlestar Galactica.. some even named it the best drama on TV.

I purchased the Braun 5270 Silk-閜il X'elle Body System Epilator one month ago and have to say that it is no where near as painful as some would let on, and it has been an effective hair removal method. I HATE shaving my legs due to chronic razor burn. I tried everything for years to reduce the irritation after shaving, however nothing ever worked. I read the reviews on many epilators as well as tips for the best use before deciding on this particular model. Overall I am very pleased with the results, I no longer have to look down at red bumpy shins and when the hair does begin to grow back it's not prickly and irritating.

Be patient, it took me what seemed like an eternity (45 minutes) to complete my legs the first time, however now that I am just maintaining them it takes less time and effort than shaving.

I think epilating before bed is a good idea, by the time you wake up the redness will subside and your skin will look better.

I quickly changed out the massaging roller for the efficiency and cranked it up to the fastest setting. I really didn't find the process painful on my legs, my bikini area is still sensitive and I'm sure that will become easier over time.

I took the tips of exfoliating to heart and have not suffered from ingrown hairs. I began my new exfoli

At almost $80, these are among the most expensive sheets I've bought -- and they're terrific, worth every penny.  They're substantial in weight and were soft from the very beginning, almost flannel-like, but smoother.  I've bought other high thread-count sheets before; nothing else has felt like this.  They go on easily.  My husband willingly makes the bed alone with these sheets, since you don't need to pull hard to make them fit over deeper mattresses.

I use the furminator on my two cats, one long-haired and one short-haired.  It really works equally well on both, though it does require a little more effort on the longer haired cat.  They actually seem to enjoy it and the hair flies off both of them, literally.  The hair just goes everywhere, up my arm, on the floor, etc.  Best to use it on a non-carpeted surface.

We decided to try this product because we couldn't get our 13 year old son to stop biting his fingers and our 5 year old daughter to stop sucking her thumb. In the past 4 weeks we have had amazing results. Our daughter has stopped sucking her thumb even at bed time. Our son is doing a lot better with biting his fingers and they are healing. He even asks us now to paint his nail because he likes how healthy his hands are looking. I would recommend this product to anyone who is having a problem with nail biting or thumb sucking. It really works!!!

I would like give this little notebook a 5 star. However, I wanted more. I only travel 20% of the time,and I'd like to use it as a desktop for the other 80%. I hooked up an usb mouse, usb keyboard, external monitor, and an usb dvd drive. Everything works like a desktop, except I cannot turn on the power without opening up the lid to access the power button. Even if I put it to the standby mode, I cannot wake it up by using the external keyboard. This is not what I have in mind. Other than that, it is a great machine. I love it.

This was recommended by a nutritionist because I was starting an exercise routine--esp. doing walking.  The Omron HJ-112 is great.  It not only shows how many steps you take, but also how many of those are "aerobic" steps.  Also shows calories burned and miles walked.  Easy to use--instructions for calibrating steps and setting it all up are pretty simple.  Additional perks--it can be put in a coat pocket or in a purse or handbag, not just clipped onto waist or outside of pocket AND it holds each day's info. for up to a week.  I use it all the time now!

Flip Video has figured out that most of us don't want a plethora of complex bells and whistles when all we want to do is capture some video of our kid's baseball game or birthday party.  Imagine this - a video camera slightly larger than a pack of cigarettes that needs NO tape cartridges, runs on two AA batteries, and has no complicated settings controlled by buttons so small that a normal adult can't operate them.  The unit has a flip out USB connector and its own built-in software that allows you to upload the video to your computer virtually hassle free.  The resulting files are in standard AVI format.  The camera captures up to one hour of video (why would you EVER need more if you don't want to bore your audience with excessive footage?) in 640 by 480 format, which looks very nice on a regular television.

My one quibble with the camera is that it is difficult to hold it still while recording, which results in occasionally jittery footage if you are not careful.  (This problem is addressed with special software on many vastly more expensive tape-based units.)  However, given the price, convenience, portability, simplicity and quality of this unit, I can live with occasional jitter.  Highly recommended.

I have owned many computers over the last 25 years, starting with an IBM "personal portable" which had the size and portability of small refridgerator ;-}.  High points have included the Compaq Aero of the late 1980s, the pioneering sub 3 lb Sony Vaio TS of the late 1990s and the shiny ultralight Toshiba M300 Portege of the early 2000s: in my view this Samsung X360 is the best of the lot, the shizzle when it comes to ultralight laptops.  For me the key issues are its lightness (scarcely over a kilogram), its large very bright 13.3 screen, its seven hour battery life, and its solid build quality. The only possible thing might have been if it also included an optical drive, but that might have meant it was less svelte, light, and cheap... (I got it on a day Amazon was selling it for $1049, and there is a $300 Samsung mail-in rebate on top of that).  I am really happy with the purchase

I'm ashamed to say just how many versions of TWOO I have. Let's see.... Beta (2), VHS (3), LD (1), DVD (now 2). This film classic has been a part of my life since first seeing it in the 1950s.  I've watched it many, many  times, and never cease to be amazed by the beauty of the story.   This  newest edition of the classic contains musch to make it a &quot;must  have&quot;.  I found the documentary by Angela Lansbury, the outtakes,  interviews, and audio tracks to be well worth  the cost.  In addition the  color transfer is first-rate, better than any other of my editions.

This is a great device. Unless you are a professional it has all you will ever need in a video camera.  It is a simple point and shot with a zoom that is adequate for most tasks.  The ability to just flip out the USB on the side and load the clips directly onto the computer makes life so much easier. 

What wasn't clear when I bought it was that the video is stored in a series of clips. This allows you to flip through them and delete the ones that you don't want. I really like this ability. 

The camera is small and compact. I find that I have it with me more often because it fits into my pants pocket. Try that with a regular video camera. 

Overall this camera is awesome. It's inexpensive so you don't worry about the kids making their own videos, it small so you carry it more often and it takes great pictures. I loved it so much I bought a second.

George Forman please step aside. The Cuisinart GR-4 Griddler is wonderful. 4 - in - 1 functions as a contact grill, panini press, open grill or griddle. It's compact and stylish. I have made chicken & steak and the meal was great. The Griddler adjusts itself based on the thickness of the meat and you can adjust the heat level while cooking. The Griddler is easy to use and the best part is the cooking plates can be removed. It is dishwasher safe or can be easily cleaned with running water and paper towel. There is no more cleaning the grill while your food gets cold. This product is more expensive then the George Forman, but based on my experience well worth the money!

Sci-fi has a bad rap, and one that it often deserves. A great many recent space operas have stepped way past the point where the setting overshadows the characters and the premise becomes alienating. Along with Firefly, the new Battlestar Galactica is one of the few shows this decade that has truly achieved this feat. The action blazes and the special effects are consistently impressive, as is par for the course among this set of shows. Yet the characters and plots are rich with real meaning, and the acting is well above average for TV - considerably less common in this genre. Battlestar Galactica's balance puts it well above the competition.

There's no way to make the premise of Battlestar Galactica sound good on paper, but I'll do my best. The 12 colonies of humanity are destroyed in a nuclear attack by the robotic Cylons, who have created agents indistinguishable from humans. The lone military vessel that survives the attack is the aging Galactica, which leads a fleet of the few human survivors on a quest for the long-lost home of humanity, Earth. Of course, this was all in the schlocky 70s cheese-fest of the same name (except for the Cylon agents). The new Galactica adds a tension between the military leaders of the Galactica and the civilian leaders of the fleet and several other notable plot twists. 

Anyway, there's no point in trying to make the premise sound defensible. What really puts Battlestar Galactica atop the sci-fi heap is the acting and writing. Oscar-caliber actors fill out the two lead roles (Edward James Olmos & Mary McDonnell), and the supporting cast does an excellent job as well. Particularly impressive is James Callis as an unwilling pawn of the Cylons, whose turn toward madness is wonderfully realized. For their part, the writers do their very best to keep the show, despite its setting, down to earth. The characters are plainspoken and the plot tension never relies on made-up technology. Instead of technobabble, we get an intense and entertaining allegory of the dilemmas facing our world in the war on terror. 

This DVD box includes the original three-hour miniseries, which is probably the set's single greatest highlight. Other standout episodes include Bastille Day, Act of Contrition/You Can't Go Home Again, The Hand of God, and Colonial Day. Really, there's not a whole lot of fat on this season, or on the show at all. It's consistently gripping, entertaining, and challenging. Strongly recommended.

I have the KX869AT model, which comes with SLED 10. However standby/suspend wasn't working initially. Looking at http://www.hp2133guide.com/forums/, I found the location on HP's site to download a BIOS update - applying that solved standby/suspend issues. I also changed the configuration to Ubuntu 8.04 and XP (dual boot), which really helped with the user experience. Ubuntu took some work to get going (there is a great Ubuntu install guide available at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/HP2133) but it was worth it - it works very well. 

The device is really well designed and looks elegant. Typing on the keyboard is as good as a regular laptop, the touchpad (after adjustments) works very well, and the whole device just shows great build quality.

This litter box is a very ingenious design and couldn't be simpler in concept. Our two cats took to it straight away. After using it for a couple of weeks both ways (manually scooping every day and/or rolling every day) I'd summarize the pros and cons this way:

Pros:
1)Very, very easy to use - a quick roll and roll back and your done. If you REALLY hate scooping litter, but don't want to deal with the cost or maintenance issues of an automated system this is a great compromise.
2)Big enough for a couple of cats - they don't seem to mind sharing it.

Cons/things to pay attention to (all fairly minor - no fatal flaws):
1) The screen is a bit coarse and some of the smaller pieces that you might catch with a scoop slip through.
2) If the contents are very "fresh", you can get a bit of a mess on the screen, which then needs to be removed for cleaning (timing is important).
3) Urine clumps stick to the bottom, so you'll often need to peer into the box and use a scoop to "pop" any reluctant clumps loose.
4)Clumps towards the back of the box can fall behind the tray as you roll them into the tray - then you have to retrieve them, yuk. Just tilt everything towards you a bit as you are rolling and that won't happen.
5)With the screen in place the "floor" area in the box is reduced a fair bit (by 1/3 I'd say.
6) If the latches aren't all engaged you will get a spill out the back when you roll it. I check to make sure every time.

This is basically a workbook for people with troubled marriages or those who just want to make further commitments to their marriages. It has some very good ideas.

Other than that it is a pretty good book.

This was my first laptop and I couldn't be happier.  I didn't need some expensive bulky machine, because if I needed to do some sort of critical, powerful task I would use a desktop.  The eeepc meets and exceeds my needs.  It comes installed with an impressive amount of software.  There is something for everyone, whether it be a media/music player, office software, games, or a web related program.  There are also many applications installed that do not show up under any of the tabs but can be accessed by typing there names in a terminal(ctrl + alt + t).

It is incredibly light-weight, and looks very nice.  It has a very nice build, and is durable.  I wouldn't say that it looks cheaply built at all, which considering the low price is quite the achievement.  Also, you can look at 100's of pictures, but without using it hands on you can not picture how small this laptop is.  It has a full keyboard, which takes a little time to get used to.  The most annoying key is the right shift key.  It is one over to the right of where it normally is, so you will constantly find yourself hitting the up arrow key.

Considering the amount of software included and the small form factor, this laptop is a steal for this price.  There is no "bloat-ware" installed, and everything is fully functional, no office 30 day trials, etc.

The default operating system is a customized Xandros distribution.  It's debian based and is very easy to use.  I am a linux user, however, the way the OS is set up anyone can use this machine, regardless of whether you are a windows user or not.  Everything is simply categorized under different tabs and doesn't take long to get used to.  For the linux users, you can still do all the fun things in the terminal, and activate advanced mode, which is basically a KDE desktop.  Or you can install other flavors of linux on the machine(this I haven't attempted, but many others have successfully done).

Also as a side note, many people had been complaining about the yellow sticker on the bottom of the machine stating that if it was removed it would void the warranty.  Unfortunately it covered where the ram goes, so you couldn't upgrade w/o voiding your limited warranty.  However, this has been resolved and Asus's official stance, is that this will no longer void your warranty(http://usa.asus.com/news_show.aspx?id=9223).

I can not give anything but praise for this machine, and would highly recommend it to others looking for an affordable, portable laptop.

This grill cooks great and is easy to use. Some of the best $40 I ever spent. We use it about twice a week as we like to grill our chicken, fish etc... and the food cooks evenly and tasty.

I bought it, hooked it up and used it in minutes.  I am not using the backup software that came with it, that is only for a try before you buy.  I am using Cobian backup (free from CNET) and that works fine.  The first backup you do will take FOREVER, I backed up less than 60 gigs and it took 18 hours.  But now I do Incrementals each week and 1 full 1 time a month and I am happy.  The incrementals usually take about 30 minutes.  Would I buy it again?  Probably, specially if the price went lower.

This is a very solid router. It was reasonably easy to set up and has been a solid performer. The reason for only 4 stars is the administrative interface. It is somewhat jumbled and it is not always clear where you need to go for some of the settings. Netgear is much better on this front as far as I'm concerned, but this D-Link has been a lot more reliable than the Netgear offerings.

This sucker really strips the over-fur off the little beasts.  Use it gently, follow up with a slicker brush to remove loose excess and one can gather enough preshedding fur to stuff a pillow.

These are by far my favorite sheets.  I've had one set for about a year, and just bought my 2nd set.  The latest set I bought is the caf?color.  As others have mentioned, this turned out to be more of a tawny gold.  I happen to love that color, but if you were hoping for a light tan, you might be disappointed.

They get softer with washing, but they're also very durable.  They're decadently cool and silky without being thin or slippery.  You won't wake up with the pillows on the floor with these.

I've had several friends ask my where I got these sheets, and a couple have also bought them and been very pleased.

Great item if you know how to use it.  A lot of pressure is not needed for it to do its work.  My bloodhound actually lays down for me to use the furminator on her.  She enjoys it royally.  Also, fur is not flying all over the place.  Just remove it often from the tool and throw it away.

The Playseats Evolution a great option for any serious racer on a budget.  The seat itself has the look of a race seat, but is wide and flat to accommodate most any driver.  The seat is very soft and comfortable.  I am 6'5" tall and 250 pounds and have no issues with being cramped.  If anything, the pedal mount extends further than you'd ever need it to.  Construction is average...as with most made in China products.  The fitment during assembly was OK.  The seat is constructed with semi-sloppy tack welds.  The main gripe I have with the seat is with the paint finish.  My seat arrived with several rub marks on the paint.  The packaging is so tight that metal pieces end up rubbing each other during shipment, marring the paint. The paint finish is sub-par and I expect that it will wear quickly.

I am using this seat with a Logitech G25 wheel, which meant that a separate shift mount had to be purchased (which amazon doesn't even sell.)  This single piece runs between $30-40, so it does add significantly to the overall price of the seat.

In the end, the Playseats pro's outweigh its con's.  It looks great, is very comfortable and seems to work well with all the popular wheels.  The Evolution adds another layer of realism to the racing simulator experience.

Because of the design this coffee maker makes a great cup of coffee as compared to some others.  It even made Folgers and Maxwell House taste better.  It's hot when you pour it which is a plus.  With some others I had to put it in the microwave right after pouring it into the cup.  If you want a good cup of coffee at a respectable price I would recommend this one.

The Kingmax 8GB super stick is better than its predecessors, in that it has a hardened form factor.  I can't vouch whether it is washer-dryer safe, but the casing does seem sturdier than other models.  According to Vista, its memory write speed is 6-7 mbps - the packaging says only 3mbps write, so I'm happy that they understated the speed (or Vista's metrics are inaccurate - unthinkable!).   However, the pink external case shaped like a rorsach test pig is just plain ... surreal.  It's not integral to the device, and can be discarded (it's predecessors did not have an external case).   I think that the marketing committee at Kingmax  may have had one too many during happy hour at the local pub.  Buy this product - you'll love it - and then lose it.   The plastic spring-shaped lanyard easily breaks (thus I lost the drive a day after I wrote the first part of the review).   Remove the springy lanyard, and use the the nylon part, and you'll be OK.  When you edit a review, you can't change the star rating, otherwise I'd mod this down to a 1.

After having watched the mini-series on HBO I was thrilled to see that it went to DVD. I thought it was a very thought-provoking, conversation-starting series. It was something that I haven't done since ROOTS was on TV all those years ago. It had been a long time since any mini-series had drawn me to be disappointed about missing an episode. Thanks to HBO for putting it on DVD. It gives a side of John Adams that no one ever really knew about; about how he got involved in the Revolution and how he felt about public service.

I love this ultra waterpik.  My Gums are feeling better everyday, which is completely different from how they would feel after flossing.  I would recommend you read the directions and start on the lowest setting when first starting because this thing will blow your gums off.  I am able to turn the setting ups an I feel good about that because it shows my gums are getting stronger with every use.

I have been using this fondue pot for a while, and I like the way it performs - when the fondue level runs low, it still manages to keep the heat even. When melting the cheese and wine initially, it heats quick but doesn't burn. At first I thought I was going to regret not getting the non-stick version, but I don't have a problem. Even crusted cheese comes off easily, and I can stick the pot part in the dishwasher (make sure you let all the water dry off before using again, common sense)
The reason it ends up being a star short is the power cord. This may have been the safest way to do it, but I find myself tethered to an extension cord (which increases the chances of a breakaway disconnect just by weight) or to some wall where the very short power cord plugs in directly.

Just for us, since we're generally careful with all the appliances we have, I'd have preferred a slightly stronger breakaway, like the MacBook Pro's (try it) or even a non-magnetic weak lock.

Still a nice, reliable, very functional product.

Let's face it, the first three books were essentially a kind of female-centered porn. No nudity, no sex, certainly, but every woman's ideal menage-a-trois: two hot steamy guys with all the right qualities who want nothing more than to talk about their feelings, ask her all about herself, and watch her sleep, without once peeking under the covers. Until now, this series has pandered to this innocent girl's fantasy, a world where men love their women so much they can't imagine touching them inappropriately. These men are not real men any more than Barbie or Pamela Anderson are real women. They are fantasies -- and the voracious appetite with which women of all ages fell for this love triangle suggests that Stephenie Meyer has given many women what they didn't know they really wanted.

Enter Breaking Dawn. Finally, a book that removes the fantasy love contest between Edward and Jacob and replaces it with faster plotting and interesting vampire lore -- the kind of thing male readers were thirsting for all along. The vampire backstory gets very rich here, we learn things about vampires that suggest endless sequel potential and a universe of vampiric variations that would satisfy any fantasy reader not otherwise obsessed with the hokey love triangle. I am glad I read this book, it's the best of the four from a male reader's perspective (and you namby-pamby men out there who really were into the Jacob/Edward debate, spare me your whining). The only thing it lacked was a knock-down, drag-out apocalypse of immortal carnage -- something that should still be written. Clearly the Romanian vampires feel as I do that such a battle royale would be worth watching. 

Gender-baiting aside for a moment. This battle would be more important than I make it sound. Such a massive rumble would be the best way to depict the message of this book. Yes, naysayers, this book does convey a powerful message -- one that so many of those one-star reviewers who are complaining about Stephenie Meyer's corrupting influence failed to see. (Really, complaining that Bella fails to be a role model because she gets married and has a child? Have you not read the author's bio? She was married at 21 before she finished college and had three children while still in her 20s. Think she's a failure? Think again. She's fabulously successful, insanely wealthy and has a college degree -- did you think that Stephenie wouldn't see the world through rose-colored, happiness-prone glasses when her own life is exactly that, deliriously happy?).

The real point of this book is that we can and should choose love. That despite our personal weaknesses and faults -- our immature attempts at love and our petty jealousies -- we can make important, permanent decisions that will tie us to other people, making their lives and our lives better in the process. The battle I propose -- one I hope sees the light of day in a future novel -- would seal Bella's decisions and the decisions of her family and loved ones in a way that would render their commitments real. Some would have to die to preserve the love they have made immortal. Others would have to kill to do the same. Nothing is more final, especially for immortals. But they would do so to vanquish the petty dynasty of the Volturi and establish a global movement of vampires that respect human life and restrain their selfish hungers in deference to the greater good. Something that wise humans do every day. 

Such a symbolic battle would take this series to the next level. But even without it, this book is the best evidence that Meyer wasn't really writing a sloppy romance saga for misty-eyed girls, but was instead telling a story about the eternal power of love and self-denial that would serve women and men alike.

We were given a Halo SleepSack as a gift and I had never heard of them before. We started using it when our son was a few months old and used them every single night since and for every nap too. We went through every size and then when he outgrew the XL we were very happy to see that they made them for toddlers as well. The toddler sizes have holes in the bottom so they can walk while wearing the SleepSack. Our son was a very active sleeper and would never have kept blankets on even when it was safe to use them so the SleepSack was a great solution for us. Our son will be 3 in April and just moved to a big boy bed so we are no longer using the SleepSacks but they were our "must have" for almost 3 years.

After reading about this tool on a message board I just had to purchase it for my golden. I couldn't believe how much hair I got off her, enough to fill a paper grocery bag. My dog stood quietly the whole time I brushed so I know it felt pleasant to her. Only the loose undercoat was removed leaving her topcoat shiney and smooth. 

This tool is not to be confused with the 'slicker' brushes sold at pet stores. I have one of those, it does take some loose hair out but not like the Furminator.

The picture and sound quility of the film are amazing on DVD.  The story is absolutely breathtaking.  The only knock I have about the DVD is for the extra price of being a Disney DVD, why couldn't they throw in a few extras  like so many other DVD movie releases have done - I felt that Disney got  cheap on us on that respect, that's why I gave them 4 stars, instead of 5.   The movie on widescreen will blow you and your children away, but I was  expecting a few extras like most other DVD's.

This review is from: The Wizard of Oz (Three-Disc Collector's Edition) (DVD)

      



Words cannot describe the joy of watching this beloved classic as a child.  In the day of  "tonight's special ABC, NBC, or CBS movie event" films like "The Wizard of Oz," "The Sound of Music," and "Gone With The Wind," were truly TV magic.  Remember these films were not readily available on vhs or dvd as they are today.  And movie theaters did not show them after their initial release.  "The Wizard of Oz" is one of the most sweet and inspirational films that has ever been produced.  Judy Garland's "Dorothy' is played to perfection and the songs are pure magic.  The movie plays as a stage production, an MGM musical extravaganza, and a dreamlike fantasy that sweeps the viewer over the rainbow and into one adventure after another.  We join Dorothy as she encounters her fantastic friends, The Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), The Tin Man (Jack Haley), and The Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr) all characters are played with brilliant performances.  The b&w sepia tone of the beginning, as Dorothy struggles with the cruel Ms. Gulch (Margaret Hamilton) who comes for the beloved Toto, is a wonderful idea, as many films were filmed in b&w at the time.  This helped add to the beauty of the colorful Land of Oz, as Dorothy leaves the b&w interior of the farm house, which has just crash landed in the glorious Land of Oz, and steps into the bright and shiny world of Technicolor Oz.  Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, is played wonderfully by Billie Burke, (who I also loved in The Man Who Came to Dinner).  Glinda comes to Dorothy's aide throughout the movie and protects Dorothy from Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch of the West.  Margaret Hamilton plays a really wicked Wicked Witch!  She's so believable in this part and also does well in the film's opening scene as Ms. Gulch.  This is one of the most beautifully filmed movies, not only of the late 1930's, but of Hollywood's cinema history!  I don't believe David O' Selnicks masterpiece, "Gone With The Wind" has been taken as good of care as this film.  "Gone With The Wind" was made the same year as "Oz," which was 1939, and deservingly won all the major categories at the Oscars.  However, as I recently watched the 4-disc collector's release of "Gone With The Wind," I couldn't help but notice several flaws, including color smears that wobbled down the screen (especially in the "evening prayers" scene), glitches and sound clicks from time to time.  I must say this 3-disc edition of "The Wizard of Oz" is totally amazing and well worth the price.  The dvd's are awesome in picture quality and sound!  The color picture cards and the booklets are a very nice addition for die-hard collectors of "Oz" memorabilia, like me!  If you're a classic cinema buff or a long time fan of "The Wizard of Oz," this dvd release is a must!

I purchased the Braun CCR2 Syncro Shaver and its cleaning system for my boyfriend.  He is one of the most lazy guys on earth about shaving and NEVER (ok - almost never) cleans his shaver.  With a touch of a button I can go into the bathroom and clean the thing, which helps keep all the hair off the sink and counter.  Although it does smell a bit like alcohol while it is doing its thing, the smell does not last long, and does not linger. I have also tried the shaver on my legs and it works beautifully.  This system is perfect for lazy people, and it does get the shaver much cleaner then running it under water.

I ordered two wireless rumblepads for my macbook. I was worried when I saw that the package only listed instructions for PC, but on my macbook, they were plug & play. No installation needed. These work very well. I was skeptical about the performance of the wireless aspect of these controllers, but the buttons have worked 100% of the time and the response time is impeccable. The only problem that I've had is when using both of them simultaneously, the controllers have actually switched in the middle of gameplay (player one became player 2, and vice versa). This has only happened once, and I use the controllers frequently. Since now I make sure that each controller is sync-ed to the appropriate sensor before running any games. Overall the best gamepad out there.

I've been looking at this pedometer for months, reading all the reviews, and agonizing over whether or not to buy it. (A trip to the emergency room last week convinced me that I've GOT to stop putting off walking and get myself in better shape.) That the software tracks both steps and blood pressure is an attractive feature, but I've already got an expensive blood pressure monitor that's not one of the ones that you can download the data from.

Before buying, I first emailed Omron to ask if it's possible to manually enter the blood pressure data, then (because I was having a fit to go on and order it), called them directly to ask. The person I spoke to on the phone said there's no way to manually enter data but that she'd put in a request to add that feature. She was very nice. I went on and ordered two, one for myself and one for my sister, so I could benefit from Omron's instant rebate special that was expiring that day.

THEN...I got a very nice phone call from a guy from Omron, I think his name was John but I'm not sure, who said YES, you CAN manually enter blood pressure data. You can't manually enter pedometer data, but there's a data entry screen for blood pressure and pulse. He took the time to tell me exactly how to get to the screen and said I didn't even have to have the product to download the software and install it. I was thrilled!

Okay, here's what you do: Go to software.omronhealthcare.com. You will see three products that all have the health management software. He said it doesn't matter which one you download because they're all the same, but I discovered that all of them don't have the latest version of the software listed. Check all three and get the one that's the most current because, if you don't, you'll have to uninstall/reinstall the earlier version later.

Once you download the software and unzip it--and THIS IS IMPORTANT--be sure to disable any virus program and deactivate any firewalls BEFORE double-clicking the setup.exe file to install it. As soon as it's finished installing, re-enable the firewalls and virus program immediately.

The program icon should be on your desktop, so you can play around with it while you're waiting for your nifty new pedometer to arrive. In the Weekly Blood Pressure/Pulse graph, to the right, you'll see a yellow View/Enter Data button. It's very small, so keep looking for it if you don't see it right away. It's there. Click on that, enter your data, then save and close. The data you entered will be shaded pink. So I guess, in the future, if you get another blood pressure monitor that you can download the data from, you'll be able to differentiate it from your manually entered data.

I have not attempted yet to export a .CSV file to be sure the manually entered data also exports, but I'll bet it does. Why wouldn't it?

Anyway, I am very pleased and very excited about finally ordering my Omron pedometer. And less than 24 hours after ordering, I got the email that it's shipped. YAY!

This review is from: Gone with the Wind (VHS Tape)

      



Great Balls of Fire! Books, reams and such have been written about this greatly beloved film - so I'll take a stab at it to! First off, a little trivia: Scarlett was originally going to be named Pansy. (yeah. right.) TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY was the original working title of the novel. GONE WITH THE WIND comes from the poem NOM SUM QUALIS ERAM by the 18th century poet Ernest Dawson i.e.: "I have been faithful to thee Cynara in my fashion. I have forgot much, Cynara! Gone with the wind!". Most everyone knows that this ultra famous picture concerns a beautiful, - in this version anyway - willful, egotistically headstrong daughter of a wealthy plantation owner who uses her cunning charms - with varying degrees of success - to get what she wants during the American Civil War of 1861-1865. In the role of Scarlett, Vivien Leigh is magnificent. She conveys all the intricate qualities of this selfish, charming & fascinating Southern vixen which captivated the the imagination of thousands of the faithful readers of the 1936 novel by Margaret Mitchell. Countless actresses - and unknowns - were considered/tested for the part: Hepburn, Crawford, Davis, Shearer, Joan Bennett, Susan Hayward, Frances Dee, Irene Dunne, Lana Turner, Margaret Tallichet Loretta Young, Miriam Hopkins, Jean Arthur, Paulette Goddard, Tallulah Bankhead, Margaret Sullavan - even Lucille Ball (!) immediately come to mind. Because he was without a doubt the "King of Hollywood", it is rather ironic that Clark Gable was right for the part of Rhett Butler. But right he was! This and his performance as Gay Langley in THE MISFITS were his two personal favourites. Imagine who Rhett MIGHT have been: Ronald Colman, Gary Cooper, Warner Baxter, Fredric March & Errol Flynn....o k a y....As Melanie Wilkes, Olivia de Havilland is near perfection and Hattie McDaniel brilliantly made the role of Mammy her own. No wonder she coveted the first Oscar awarded to a Black actress! The scene where Melanie and Mammy climb the stairs towards a half-mad-with-grief Rhett (after Bonnie's accidental death) is a magnificent lesson in screen acting. As a kid, I didn't understand why Ashley Wilkes spoke with an English accent, but his acting style was right for the part. Another standout was Ona Munson (Eve Arden was considered for the part) doing a sterling job portraying that soiled-dove-with-a-heart, Belle Watling: her carriage scene with Melanie is quite memorable. Joan Fontaine, Anne Shirley, Frances Dee, Ann Dvorak & Dorothy Jordan were considered for the part of Ms Wilkes. For Ashley? Melvyn Douglas, Joel McCrea, Jeffrey Lynn, Lew Ayres, Tyrone Power, Ray Milland were all considered. Billie Burke may have been cast as Aunt Pitty & Judy Garland may have gotten to play Carreen! Legend says that this filmed grossed $2O MILLION by May of 194O - which is astounding because of the average price of movie tickets then - 35c - (!). The film was nominated for 13 AA & won 8. Vivien Leigh was personally praised by author Mitchell (whom she resembled somewhat - look at photos of young "Peggy" Mitchell) as was Olivia de Havilland and Hattie McDaniel likewise. Mitchell thought Gable was fine as Rhett, but disapproved of Howard as Ashley Wilkes. Reviews for the film were for the most part highly laudatory & the general public was enthralled: Selznick's gamble on hiring a relatively unknown Leigh at first irritated - but later delighted American audiences. It was indeed a victorious gamble. Vivien Leigh herself never cared much for Scarlett. She knew it was a great part, but thought her character was a bit of an ass. Leigh's favourite part? Where Scarlett says that she has turned out "disappointing" - concerning her mother's expectations of her - while a bit on the tipsy side.

The only complaint I really have about this product is that it doesn't seem to stay charged for a very long time.  Also, I wish it was sold with a better quality headset.  I like to download some of my favorites at itunes.com or download some of my cds onto the device.  Overall, this is a great product at a great price.  Thanks Amazon for discounting the price on this item and this is the reason why I chose to buy it from your company.  I saved a total of $25 by buying it from Amazon.

This machine is perfect if you don't mind the expense and don't require strong coffee.  It has been working flawlessly for me for several months now.  I have used many of the K cups, but have more recently been using the reusable filter to save on money.  Using K cups you will spend around $400 per year on coffee if you drink two cups/day.  Because the water passes through the coffee very quickly, it is impossible to get it very strong the way some people like.  Still, I buy the strongest coffee available, to make what some consider a weak/moderate coffee (fine for my tastes).  Had I done my research before buying this, I may have opted for a french press instead (which I didn't even know about at the time).

Battlestar Galactica Season 2 was a mixed season.  The first half was truly great.  But after the Pegasus three-parter, the quality started to go down the drain.  The episode "Black Market" is probably the worst episode of the series' run.

Enter Season 3.  The first episode was just perfectly made and acted.  It felt like a completely different show.  This season's four-part opener is some of the best TV out there, especially the magnificent "Exodus Part II".  The show continued with such excellent episodes as "Collaborators" and "Hero".  The first half of the season ended with the jaw-dropping "The Eye Of Jupiter".  The second half of the season was slightly weaker then the first half, but still had great episodes such as "Maelstrom" and "Crossroads Part II".

The acting in this show is amazing.  Michael Hogan gives the best performance of the year as Col. Tigh.  Other great performances are given by Aaron Douglas as Chief Galen Tyrol and Katee Sackhoff as Starbuck.

Is Gone With The Wind the greatest example of filmmaking?  No.  But it is one of the greatest examples of movie entertainment out there.  The proof is in the way this movie of epic length and proportion has held the  audience attention for over sixty years.  Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh are  larger than life as two of the most famous characters of all time.  Gable  in particular deserves credit for a performance that displays a wider  emotional range than we're used to seeing from him.  Olivia deHavilland is  perfect in a role that must have been difficult to bring to life and seem  real.  Hattie McDaniel is terrific, finally given a chance to show her  dramatic ability instead of simply being comic relief.  Only Leslie Howard  fails to deliver, and he seems uncomfortable with his role.  The  technicolor is beautiful, the swelling score is unforgettable, and although  I think the first half of the movie works better than the second half, the  film as a whole reminds you of the magic that movies can make.

I purchased this little drive in July '08 to use as a backup drive, and for more space for files. I am highly impressed with it's quality! I've left the drive on for days on end with my PC, and it never burns up or causes problems, and works wonderfully! :D

It's a great feature to have it powered by USB, for less electricity usage.

I didn't use the Fabrik backup software, as I wanted to be able to access my backed up files.

If you're looking for a small drive, at a great price and great quality, look into these little ones .. .they are wonderful!

We purchased this video for our 8yr old nephew for Christmas! He(of course)had already seen the movie, but he shared it with the rest of the family and I believe enjoyed watching it with us. We all especially enjoyed the movie short at the end. The service with Amazon was great, I received my package when I expected. I probably will order more from Amazon in the near future.

The cover of this book tells the premise: We know you're going to eat a fast-food hamburger sometime, so when you do, here's the best choice. This has to be the only diet book in the world to recommend a Big Mac, but the bottom line is, it's better than a Whopper. I was shocked at some of the comparisons - for example, choose Starbucks' egg and ham breakfast sandwich over the multigrain muffin - who knew? Of course we'd all be healthier if we ate sprouts and yogurt all the time, but the fact is, we don't. This book will help you make good eating decisions in the real world. Well worth the price.

Received the Waterpik Ulta Dental-opened the box, spent 3-4 minutes ( or less )on the instructions, set it up in about a minute-and Voila----it worked perfectly. Couldn't have been easier.
Minor drawback. The reservoir could have held a bit more water for my taste, but it is not very meaningful at all.

This is a great toaster oven.  Some people complained about the oven not toasting well, but I did not find toasting a problem (and I'm pretty persnickety about toast).  The directions claim if you like bread very brown and crunchy then hit toast: defrost: start. When you follow the directions, it toasts great.  The convection is also great, as is the general oven.

With so many other positive reviews, mine is probably not required. But I was compelled considering the impressive performance of this trimmer. 

To be honest, I ordered it without reading the description carefully and assumed it used a small battery. I liked its compact yet heavy-duty stainless appearance. I was so disappointed when I first opened the package, but that was quickly dispersed when I tried it out.

I have owned battery powered trimmers. Each was purchased after much research and comparison - only to achieve the same "ho-hum" capability. 

It seemed that none trimmed close enough to suit me, as if trimmer designs were so paranoid about nicking your skin, they sacrificed the main objective of closely trimming the unwanted hairs.

This little guy amazed me. It trims closely without irritation, its operation is easy and bearing-like smooth, and it needs no battery. It is a solid, well constructed stainless steel unit made to last.

I realize it is not going an item to call all your friends about or discuss with excitement over dinner, but when a device works well in this age of exaggerated advertisement, it deserves proper acknowledgement. 

One key instruction to be highlited (for those who typically skip reading them): Rotate the base back and forth to operate the trimmer, rather than in one constant direction. Other than that - prepare yourself for simplicity, quality, and satisfaction.

This food processor is extremely well designed and well constructed. It makes my food preparation much quicker. One word of caution, unless you need to prepare food for more than 2 people, this is not for you. Quantity of food makes a difference in your experience. I don't chop my green onions or mince one or two carrots in there. It won't work.The free videotape is very well presented and helpful. Good job.

Can't beat the ease of installation.  Run the CD, plug up the router, click next a few times and bam, it's done.  5 minutes tops and that's counting unpacking the shipping box.  

I'm able to run two VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) through it simultaneously and all day with zero problems from the router.  Also able to surf from my backyard almost 100 ft away from the router and through three walls and a deck which means the range is great too.

Only drawback I notice (I've had the unit for a couple weeks now) is the amount of space it takes up on the desk.  It's not a model you can stand up on a base and requires a 6x8" space on the desk (not including the room needed for the cable coming out the back).  I don't believe it can be wall mounted.  Good news is that there's no antenna sticking up from the thing and since it's maybe an inch high it's pretty unnoticeable if it's installed a waist level or above.

All in all a great router and I'd purchase again.

I really love this series. This third book was pretty good, but I expected a little more. I think some people are being a little too harsh though. I was glad Bella stopped to consider her options, she should. This made some reviewers really upset. In the end of course I want her to end up with Edward, but she has to give up a lot to ultimatly do that. Also people who want them to get married or sleep together-hello this is a young adult novel not a romance for middle-aged women. It would be nice if in a latter book this happened, but it is difficult to keep it YA with that content. And lastly it is a fantasy novel about a teenage girl so it is supposed to be fun and maybe a little unrealistic. I remember being a little obsessed with a boy when I was young like her. 
Overall if you are a fan of the first two books, this book will satisfy your need to continue the story. It was good, just a little different then I expected. I am anxiously awaiting the fourth book and the book from Edward's perspective.

The DIR-655 worked as promised. I wanted it to be hidden, provide strong wireless connection for me and my wifes' laptops, and provide strong wired connection for Gaming for my kids. I placed it in the rafters in my basement and I'm happy with the wirelsss reception I get throughout the house (I have a ranch style - one floor). My kids were able to set up and host online gaming easily and I was able to configure it pretty good. Although I have not converted to Cat6 cabling, the wired computers reported they were connected at 1000Mb and it seems large files like movies and backups go quicker with the gigabit wired connection on my internal network - even with my old CAT5 cords. The only downside was that nobody could answer what the USB port was used for on the router. The best answer I got was from a tech support guy who said that USB support was "to be enabled with a future Firmware Uddate". Guess I still have to plug my USB mass storage into my box until then.

I bought this camcorder a week before my vacation, with two day shipping. To my disappointment, the camera's microphone was broken, so I had to go on vacation with a camera with no sound. I contacted the company, but they kept asking me questions that I already had answered in the previous correspondences. After my vacation, however I contacted the company again and I told them that I thought the microphone was broken, and they told me to ship it in, and they replaced it in about a week. The camera I have now is of excellent quality, and my daughter uses it for her show, 2 Sisters 1 House on Youtube. If you want to check out the video, you should go there and check it out. One more note, the camera software only works on one of my three computers and sometimes it crashes for no reason.

After testing the Canon TX-1, this has been my experience:

PHOTO QUALITY:  Excellent. Canon wisely uses in-camera noise reduction (blurring) lightly and preserves sharp detail.  On close magnification, single pixel detail is present, which the Panasonic DMC-TZ3 that I compared blurred details into a gradient.  Color saturation and contrast are excellent.  Focus is fast and accurate.  Overall, superb qualtiy still pictures.

VIDEO QUALITY:  Very good.  Quality is roughly midway between DV and a dedicated HD camcorder.  Though criticized by some for their large file sizes, Canon's Motion JPEG compression codec yield video that is of excellent contrast, and good color saturation.  I took video samples and re-compressed them using Canon's codec (included with their camera's software) and other codecs including MPEG2, QuickTime, and multiple other codecs from Adobe Premiere, and found that the Canon motion-JPEG, though theoretically not as efficient a compression scheme, ended up with the best quality video, while other codecs of similar file size were more washed out.  Another advantage of this compression scheme is that you can get good quality frame captures, as each frame is compressed individually.  It's not perfect:  unlike my dedicated HD camcorder, the TX-1's video has a vague "shimmering" effect, from the JPEG compression varying from frame to frame.  Also, with moving objects, the motion isn't quite as fluid with as with my dedicated HD camcorder.  But for a combination still/video platform, the video of the TX-1 is remarkably good.  File sizes are large, but they will be with any high quality video.  

ERGONOMICS:  In my medium to small hands, the camera is easy to hold.  Some reviewers complained that they needed to use their left hand to stabilize the camera, but I always hold cameras with two hands.  This one can be held with one, but any camera will yield less blurry pictures if held with two hands.  If you have large fingers, you may find this camera too small.

CONVENIENCE:  The LCD folds into the camera, and there is no optical viewfinder, so when the camera is closed, there is no vulnerable glass to scratch up on any side.  And it is so tiny that you can throw it in a pocket or bag or purse and pull it out for an unexpected spontaneous shot.

FLASH:  I was worried that the flash would be too under-powered.  It is a weak flash.  Unexpectedly, this turned out to be a good thing.  I've noticed with past cameras that indoor flash pictures screamed "FLASH!" and were bright with a thin dark shadow next to foreground objects from the flash.  This weaker flash ironically ends up making more natural shots as it doesn't saturate the shot and some existing light adds to make a more pleasing picture.  The flash is too weak to brightly light up a large dim room that you are shooting from a long distance, or if you zoom in under dim conditions.

ZOOM:  10X zoom is really powerful; I can zoom in a lot more than I expected.  The excellent image stabilization allows these zoomed in shots to not be blurred from camera motion.

LOW LIGHT:  Like virtually all compact cameras today, the tiny CCD does not perform well in very low light shots without flash. The TX-1 is no exception. Fuji cameras are known for better performance in low light, but currently don't have optical image stabilization.  The image stabilization in the TX-1 (and other cameras with this feature) help a lot because you can use much longer shutter speeds and make up for the small CCD.

PLAYBACK:  It has been fun for me to plug the camera into my widescreen TV and watch the photos and video in a combined slide show.  That format is fun for the family and allows everyone to enjoy the memories without having to sit by a computer monitor or wait for prints.

PROBLEMS:  The only thing I've not enjoyed is that the small LCD makes it harder to see detail in composing a shot, especially in bright sunlight.

OVERALL:  The TX-1 produces excellent quality still pictures, very good 720p video, is tiny, not easily scratched, has a huge zoom, great image stabilization, and will end up being something you will want to toss into a pocket or bag and capture a spontaneous, memorable moment.  It is a rare camera that can record both stills and video without one of them being useless.  I'm very happy with it.  I hope you enjoy whatever you decide on too!

The Brand New 2 disc or 3 Disc edition of Wizard of Oz is here.  the movie has been fully restored beyond its original brilliance.  See The movie like you have never seen it.  Wizard of oz is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1:33:1(full Screen) there was no wide screen at that time.

Wizard of Oz has been seen by generations of families as the movie nears its 70th anniversary movie is still great as ever no matter how many times I have seen it.  Wizard of Oz is the number one family film.

For those who own the 1 disc edition if you love special features and all that good stuff you should upgrade especially with the movie looking better then it ever has.  If you do not like all the extras the 1 disc still is suitable but I defintely would reccomend upgrading to the 2 disc or the 3 disc.  Me however I can't afford the 3-disc edition at this time so for me it is going to be the 2 disc edition especially for the price Best Buy has.  Amazon has a good price too so I say this is definitely worth a purchase.

Perfect travel, light weight laptop. Six cell battery is a must. Excellent 4 to 5 hour lifetime between charges. Qwerty keyboard is small as one would expect, but touch typing usable after a little practice.
I also use it to connect to external USB powered GPS receiver. Screen size a bit larger than portable GPS systems. Hard drive size adequate. I did not want a Netbook with only solid state drive as data base for GPS would use too much of it. Intel Atom Processor not a real "number cruncher," but adequate for most "Office" Programs. 
The fact the operating system was Windows XP Home Edition instead of Vista is a real plus.
I did purchase a 3rd party, 3 year extended warranty for the Netbook, as I travel extensively and will give it a good workout. So far so good!

I LOVE this griddle!  Easy to make flat to cook pancakes, tough non-stick surface that actually holds up to regular dishwasher detergent, one touch pop off and into the dishwasher, takes up half the space to store than a regular non-folding griddle.  Doesn't handle thin steaks too well (cooks too quickly without "browning" the outside evenly), but thick steaks (1/2" or thicker) come out absolutely delicious - as good as an outdoor grill.  Doesn't "smoke" or burn; the drip cup sometimes fills up quickly so keep an eye on it (rare).  Well worth the money.

If you know love, you'll love this film because it descibes the full range of emotions most people miss out on in marriage. My wife April and I watched this film and instantly got the message. In our opinion...this movie tells a story about the love most people search for all of their lives and never truly find.  This is a very deeply written screenplay that will likely leave many viewers empty because they are currently in relationships that are portrayed in the movie and they feel lack.  Others who have found true love will find this a source of confirmation that they have found it. 

In our opinion, this is a movie that should be watched with your teenage or older children who are unmarried.  If you watch this along with Fireproof, you can use both films as a valuable teaching tool to help your unmarried children learn about love and marriage without making the mistakes that both movies address.

This review is from: Quantum of Solace [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)

      



I dunno. To me, this movie is worth around three stars, maybe three and a half...

This isn't exactly what I'm jones-ing for when I tune in to a James Bond adventure. In re-imagining a grittier and darker franchise, with its stories placed strictly in real-world situations (no wild shootouts in outer space here), and in an effort to portray a leaner and meaner James Bond, QUANTUM OF SOLACE (and what's up with that inscrutable title?) again eschews some of the franchise's classic elements, the stuff which sets 007 apart from the other globe-trotting spies. There may be ramped-up action set pieces in this one, but the overall bleakness of the lead character depresses the hell out of you. Where did that sense of fun go?

Okay, if you're gonna branch out into a different direction, then you better tell a whopping good story. QUANTUM OF SOLACE, 22nd in the string of James Bond pictures, doesn't. In this one, Bond uncovers a nebulous organization which has managed to ensconce its agents in those elite circles deeply influential on the world stage. As things play out, a takeover plot surfaces, involving the monopolizing of Bolivia's water supply, and this Bond must avert, even if it means going rogue.

The movie follows up on the preceding (and superior) film Casino Royale (2-Disc Widescreen Edition), which featured the death of James Bond's traitorous lady love, Vesper Lynd. Turns out that Bond is taking her passing real hard, and finding it a struggle to balance his mission with his thirst for get-back. He ends up partners with a beautiful Bolivian operative who bears her own internal (and external) scars. As Bond interviews people and as they begin to die in his vicinity, M, the no-nonsense MI6 matriarch, begins to question his dedication and true motivations.

No doubt, the era of the blonde and dour James Bond got off to a rip-roaring start with CASINO ROYALE. But the franchise takes a step back with QUANTUM OF SOLACE. It doesn't bode well that the opening car chase is so lame and lackluster, with the director woefully piggybacking on those trademark Jason Bourne quick-cut, herky-jerky edits. And, taking a page from BOURNE ULTIMATUM, there's also a breakneck rooftop sequence. Daniel Craig can act, but the overwhelming thing he's got going for him is his physicality. His is the most physical and burly 007 since Sean Connery and George Lazenby drew salaries from Her Majesty's Secret Service, and surely a marked contrast from Pierce Brosnan's unimpressive frame. Craig's action sequences suggest a more intense, more brutal brand of violence. But a dichotomy rears up. The impression with CASINO ROYALE is that Bond is new to his license-to-kill status. But, in this movie, a direct continuation from CASINO ROYALE, he comes off more as a jaded, well experienced agent.

In this leaning towards real-world based plotlines, there aren't many theatrical villains. The bad guys we end up with here tend to be very unremarkable sorts, although Mathieu Amalric isn't half bad as the sinister tycoon. The film does stick with its trademark two hotties rule, but halfway discarded are those tittilating names bestowed on the femme fatale with cheeky panache. The two women gracing this screen are lovely but nondescript types, with the main actress Olga Kurylenko touting the uninspired moniker of Camille Montes. Gemma Arterton, who gets secondary status, fares better, insisting that she be referred to solely by her surname. It's not until the end credits roll around that we find out her full name, which merits a rueful smile.

We're all clued in, by now, that James Bond is damaged goods. But previous actors's takes on 007 were punctuated with a certain lighthearted touch (excepting the somber Timothy Dalton). I was on board with CASINO ROYALE's stripping Bond back to basics. But, in forsaking the glibness, QUANTUM OF SOLACE goes too far the other way. Daniel Craig's incarnation is striking in his moroseness, and in his utter lack of humor (and, yes, given, his girl had just died). There's this air of hopelessness about him. Add to that his single-minded, almost soulless devotion to his task at hand, and it adds up to a largely unempathetic character. As a nod to contemporary times, beginning with Pierce Brosnan's run, the characters in the film have been referencing Bond's misogynistic bend, his callous manipulation of not only women but of his friends. And, with the absence of whimsy and of that humor most often embodied in a wrily delivered catchphrase, there's not much to redeem his character or blunt that hard edge. As it is, this Bond is reduced to being a cold-hearted and unsympathetic killer, which is his core, anyway. Might as well put a skull design on his chest and have him start scribbling into war journals, know what I mean? Or maybe that's too harsh.

CIA's Felix Leiter is here, as is Bond's beloved Aston Martin. Judi Dench remains a hard-bitten but comforting constant. There's even a callback to a classic scene in Goldfinger. But, frankly, I miss Q and his whizbang gadgetry, and also Miss Moneypenny. I miss the vodka martini and the "Bond. James Bond." And I miss that nicely turned double entendre. The James Bond franchise endures, but there's not much solace found in this film.

My old cat went blind suddenly, and was very upset and disoriented, so I tried the Comfort Zone plug-in.  She gravitated to spot where it was plugged in, and stayed right in front of it for weeks.  It seemed to comfort her immensely.  I used it again about a month later, when I adopted a stray cat and wanted to calm him and my other cats during their introduction to each other.  They all seemed to do better in the rooms that the Comfort Zone was in.  Definitely worth a try.

It came down to the iPod Touch and the Zune 120. Yes, the iPod Touch has some cool stock features. But after a little research, I found there are tons of FREE games and apps you can download for the Zune.

The main point is, for $250, I get 120 GB of space. That's enough for my enitre mp3 and DVD collection. In contrast, the 8 GB iPod Touch for $220, can only hold my music.

Video, and especially sound quality on the Zune, is unchallenged except by very expensive media players. I have seen side by side comparison of video on iPod Touch and Zune. The Zune has bright vivid colors. The iPod looks washed out. It's not even close really. Zune wins. Check YouTube for similar comparisons.

Playing games against your friends wirelessly with your Zune awesome. You can also share music wirelessly.

Digital FM radio that lets you buy the song you're hearing if you like it.

Customizable background.

Very easy to navigate with the touch pad. It works like a laptop touch pad.

Free firmware upgrades from Microsoft. Your Zune will get upgraded with new features, games, and apps no matter how old it is. When the Zune 500 comes out with a new calander, your Zune 120 will get it also. Apple does not do this.

*The only negative is that it has no web browser or Internet capability (yet?). But really, most phones already do this anyway. And honestly, it's very rare that I'm sitting at McDonalds thinking to myself, "gee I wish I could check my email." I think I can wait 15 minutes until I get back to my desk and check it then.

If you want a true media player, built for superb video and sound quality, and can hold your entire collection, go with the Zune. If you want a PDA that plays music, go for the Touch.

Once, I even dumped a collegue's disk onto mine because it was freaking out. It took all the info, I burned it from there directly to a CD, and BAM! I'm a hero.

I wish there was an orange one, but I haven't filled up this one yet, so my wife probably won't buy me a new one anyway. I'm TOTALLY satisfied.

My kids love the movie and it is great.  The only problem is that it seems to freeze for a few seconds on one of the scenes in space.  I think the disc might be bad as it is a brand new Sony BDP-S550 player.  Have seen other reports of this.  Maybe the movie has too much DRM.

This review is from: The Little Mermaid (Limited Issue) (DVD)

      



I was born in 1987, making me two years old when Disney released The Little Mermaid. I can't remember, but it seems like this movie must have defined my youngest moments. I had a cassette tape story version memorized by age three and knew every word to every song as soon as I owned the VHS version. Well, I still love The Little Mermaid. In my opinion it is one of the five best-animated children's movies ever made. The characters are fun, fresh and wholesome, the songs are great and the story is meaningful. To me, Ariel's intense desire to see the world and live as a human is fabulously displayed in &quot;Part of that World&quot;, a song, which will always hold a place in my heart. Her passion and longing is so real, to me it is half the movie. This is not an artificial and frilly children's carousel ride, which lacks both plot and purpose. It's emotional, evocative and memorable. Every little girl should see The Little Mermaid. The ending makes me cry, every time as does the &quot;Part of Your World&quot; reprise. Do yourself a favor and buy this inarguably magnificent movie.

I bought this three months ago for my two cats. It was reasonably easy to assemble. You have it keep the reservoir filled up daily, or it will be noisy. If that's a problem for you, then buy the larger capacity one. It's also good to clean the water intake area as cat hair will collect there.
Overall, a good value.

As a version 9 user I pre-ordered NaturallySpeaking version 10. I was happy with version 9 and had been using it extensively, so I was hoping for improvements in recognition and speed.
Logged in with administrator privileges on XP SP3 (2GB RAM and 3 GHz dual core processor), I had no problems with installation. I've had no reason to contact Nuance for technical support but I may just be lucky.
Initial training seemed much longer than it did with version 9. Initial recognition was also much poorer, but improved greatly in the first half-hour. Recognition is now excellent and most of the time only plurals seem to give it problems. I had to adjust the speed/accuracy balance far toward speed to provide the kind of visual feedback I had become used to with version 9.
After about two weeks of use I'm still undecided whether it was worth the price to upgrade.

This little machine is about the size of a trade paperback.  It fits easily into most women's purses, and tucks under my arm with comfort.  At two pounds, you hardly notice you have it with you.

Although the size is halfway between my regular notebook and my Iphone, it does everything my notebook does except play DVDs.  I haven't used my optical drive in years.  Face it, everything is downloaded these days whether it's software or movies.

As a bonus for all you Vista haters, it comes with good-old-actually-works Windows XP.

This machine represents a whole new category of personal computers and costing one third the price of a mid range notebook is the final benefit.

My 17" HP is my desktop replacement.  When I go out, I bring the Acer.

This is my first MP3 player. I wanted something to take on trips and use at the gym.  The software is easy to use and I copied CDs in a matter of minutes.  The sound is great (although I am using different ear phones than what came with the player).  The size is good for me; it is small enough, but not too small.  I purchased a separate accessory package that includes chargers, cases and screen cover to protect the player.  So far I am very pleased with the Zen.

When I saw the price of these sheets they seemed to cheap to be of good quality.  I figured I'd take a chance and order one set to see if they were of decent quality.  I was impressed by what I received.  They are well made, and held up well to their first washing.  I would compare them to sheet sets that I have paid over $100 for in the past.  I was so impressed with the quality that I ordered two more sets for myself, and another set for my son and his wife.  You can't beat the quality for the price anywhere that I have seen, and with free shipping it was a no brainer.

ooma Core VoIP Phone System with No Monthly Phone Service Bills

I've had an OOMA for about a month - it definitely works as advertised.  It is simple to set up.  The real difficulties begin when you try to get a hold of OOMA customer service.  If this product is really going to take off - they will have to solve their dismal customer service.  I called them three times in an attempt to talk to anyone.  I was automatically disconnected after holding for over 20 minutes each time.  The forth time was the charm, I only waited for 10 minutes.  Once I got them on the phone they were able to help me in short order and were very helpful.  Porting an existing number is also an experience.  It takes them over a month with continual reminders to provide status. 

On the upside, I am please with the features, call quality, general performance.  I have actively tried to overload it by downloading during phone usage but so far, no problems or interruptions.  It works well with a wireless base unit and handsets or a stand alone phone just as advertised.  I will probably buy a second unit for a side business

I would definitely recommend this hard drive to anyone. It has a sleek look to it - a very glossy, black interface which will reveal all your fingerprints and dust. But that doesn't matter. 750 GB is a lot of space! Everyone should jump on this bargain. Two things I don't like about it are the noise it makes every once in a while (not a big negative for me, but just something to put out there) and the extremely short usb cable it came with. Works great with my Mac, and was very easy to partition so that I could use half for Time Machine and the other half for photos, school work, movies, etc.

I agree with most people's response to this maker in that one must freeze container to the ultimate before use, and still, it sometimes does not make hard ice cream, but hard enough for my taste. The ice cream is fantastic! It is definitely noisey, I think very noisey in fact, so you want to make the ice cream in advance BEFORE guests arrive, which then gives you the opportunity to harden it up a bit in freezer before eating.
It is definitely a pain-free way to make great ice cream. Glad we got it and good product.

I just moved into a new home with a king sized bed for the first time.  I bought a cheap set of sheets from Target just to have something on the bed, but I was really seeking something much more substantial.  

These 600 thread count sheets are a bit thicker than you might be used to, but they have a luxurious crushed silk feel to them.  I found that using fabric softener made them even more cozy and if you remove them promptly from the dryer you will avoid the wrinkling problem.  I don't exactly mind but they are lovely no matter what.

Also, I use the sheet as a top sheet in what I call "Triple sheeting".  I learned of this at a stay at a hotel.  Basically, they take a flat sheet for the bottom (I used the fitted from the set), then lay down a flat sheet, a plain comforter (like the one you'd use inside a duvet), and then another flat sheet on top.  Fold down the sheet and its a wonderful, crisp look, very easy to change your color scheme, etc.  and it just feels very luxurious.  Nothing slides around or slides off the bed either.  My spouse first mentioned how much he liked this hotel's beds then I found out their secret.  If you buy two sets (different or coordinating colors) you have a bunch of possibilities!

In summary, I've paid the same or more for sheets that I didn't like half as much as these.  I would definitely repurchase (and might just do it right now!).

I'm just going to add a few criticisms and hints as far as my experience with this camera so far:

* video quality...I'd say it is OK at 640x480 and 30 fps...you will see some "jumpiness" with faster moving objects.  Not great, but usable.  The main thing for better quality video is to mount or hold it steady to reduce vibrations...seems the software can only refresh so many "pixels" per second...so any unnecessary vibrations are going to cause video problems.  If it is mounted on a vehicle of any kind...this is most important due to the inherent vibrations found.

Don't know about you...but I don't vibrate when I walk...I just move around a lot...which causes most of the same problems.  Keep it steady if you can?

There are issues with bright light and low light.  If pointing it towards a bright sky (as part of the view) on a sunny day...anything other than the sky will be almost blacked out.  Trying to use it indoors is likely to be disappointing...it's not a low light camera...but you will see a picture when directly under light.

As far as focal length...I find that it gives a sharp picture starting at maybe 6" to 12" from a subject...out to infinity.

* audio quality...actually pretty good with the rubber seal removed from the mic and in a quiet environment.  With the seal in...the sound is muffled, but the mike is protected from moisture.  With the seal out...the sound isn't all that great in a noisy vehicle for example...I get a lot of "overload noise".

* mounting the camera...I've only used the bicycle mount so far and have found a problem where if the camera is set up in the direction I needed it to be...the adjustment ring for the mount interferes with the on/off buttons...I can just barely use them.  A thinner knurled alum ring would fix this problem.

* battery use...I use a Sandisk 2 GB card and their 5/1 card reader.  No problems with them.  

2 alkaline AA batteries should last through 2 uses of a 2 GB card. Minimum voltage for operation seems to be around 1.3V.

NiMH rechargeable batteries won't work...they don't have a high enough voltage.

* menu and settings...not all that easy to set up...best to get it to where you want it and leave it there?

Conclusions:  It's doing what I want it to...more or less.  It is light...and I'm thinking it is rugged and waterproof.  It is unobtrusive.  Video/audio could be a little better though.

I have only used it twice so far but both times it has done a great job. Very easy to use and clean up. I love that it only takes about 45 minutes total to be eating fresh ice cream.

Other than that I love it.

The razor is compact, quiet during operation as compared to other razors used and quite durable.  I dropped it removing the charger (fell about 4 ft) and nothing broke or came loose and it's still working fine.  It charges in less than 2 hours and has a compact carry case if you need to travel.   
The razor provides a close, clean shave.  After using a couple of weeks a slight rash appeared but easily cleared up and there have been no further problems so I don't think it was the razor that caused the problem.  Overall, it's a great razor.

He walked me through the manual configuration, skipping the wizard, in less than five minutes, and since then, everything has worked perfectly.

My almost 3 year old was chewing his fingernails and toenails so badly that they would bleed. He would then move on to the skin around them. It was painful and looked horrible.
In ONE DAY, he no longer attempted to put his fingers or toes in his mouth.
It worked for my 10 year old until he discovered that he could soak his fingers and scrape it off the nails. I solved that problem by re-painting after bathtime.
It's been over a month and I only had to apply it for about a week and a half. No more nail biting in this house!
The taste is very strong and it lingers. I tried it myself and it took about five minutes to get the taste to go away completely.
I'm convinced that this product saved my baby boy from pain and potential infections.

I'll start with the reason I didn't give this coffee maker 5 stars. The water container is very hard to get to and to see how much water you pour in. This is a considerable inconvenience. I overcame it by using a container with just the right amount of water and put that in the maker. It still is in an inconvenient position, however.

That said, the coffee maker is definitely commercial grade. While the documentation is not too good, it's pretty easy to get going with the unit. It's also a very stylish appliance that you'll be proud to have in your home or office.

Having a water filter is a big advantage but it can also get costly and inconvenient to have to buy them and keep them on hand. I use water that's already filtered so it's not going to be a problem.

The self-clean feature is also a good one.

I'm a coffee connoisseur so I demand excellent coffee. I grind it before putting it into the pot. So my review is based on freshly ground coffee. In my case, the coffee is above average and it doesn't take much time to brew. It also makes a few beeps when the brewing cycle has ended.

All in all, a very fine coffee maker for the person who loves great coffee and wants a stylish, commercial grade appliance to handle the job.

I love this product. We have two black labs and they shed like crazy so we HAVE to comb them on a regular basis to help prevent a lot of the excess shedding and this comb helps.  I normally comb them outside because of the mass amounts of hair that comes off when we comb them.  It is great at removing the excess hair in their undercoats.  They're noticeably more shiny afterwards too.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  Also, I purchased this directly from Amazon, it arrived on time, the price was right, and at the time I didn't have to pay S&H. I noticed this comb sold for about $50 (for med. comb) in a popular pet catalog and that is before S&H was applied. Ordering it from Amazon is your best bet.

I have tried other Crest whitestrips that would slip around on my teeth and made me feel like I wanted to swallow all the time (of course, trying not to only makes it worse; lol).  The first three times I used these I wanted to swallow (and let me tell you, they taste like hydrogen peroxide; not the most pleasant taste), but now I can put them on without having the urge to constantly swallow and spit like I did with the older versions.  They say to leave them on 30 minutes, but I've left them on for an hour because they are comfortable and I almost forget I'm wearing them.  

The only complaint I have is that the strip for the bottom teeth is smaller than the upper.  I don't know about you, but when I smile more than just my six middle bottom teeth show.  So, what I've done is a few times put the larger top strip on the bottom and visa versa.  

I really recommend these new Advanced Seal Whitestrips; they definitely seal well and make your teeth whiter!   :-D

I've been usign Braun products for years and fairly happy with all of them. This Braun Epilator is no exception. Before this, I've tried cordless Epilators from various brands, and found none of them worked quite well. I don't have a lot of body hair, but the few there are have grown coarse through years of shavings. The corded Braun Epilator is the first one that works on my hair. Compared to all the cordless epilators I've owned, this Braun is powerful and intimidating at first. It is also much more painful than all my wimpy cordless because it actually pulls a lot of hairs out with one swipe. I thought about having a glass of wine while using the Braun, but didn't because I was not supposed to operate heavy machinary while drinking. Luckily, it is almost painfree after the first round because the new growth are much finer. Despite its intimidating power, it is actually quite easy to manuver around curves as long as one is careful. Some features I thought not necessary, such as the lighting, turn out all very handy and practical. It's finally time I can throw away all my other cordless epilators and shavers. Braun is the way to go.

Updated Review.  I have now used two of these keyboards, and in both cases the letters on the keys started to wear after a few months. Before that happened with the first one, I also bought one for my wife.  Hers is holding up better, but I've been through two in about 16 months.  It could have to do with oils in my skin.  I'm going to try one more time, and this time I'll coat the keys with clear nail polish, as one reviewer recommended. 

One may wonder why I persist after having this problem with wear on the keys. My only explanation is that the touch is far superior to any other keyboard I've used, and my wife agrees.  The odd thing about it is that I am a one-finger typist while my wife is an all-fingers touch typist.  When the keys started to wear, I connected the older keyboard that came with my computer, and I couldn't adapt.  So I'll try again, hoping that the nail polish does the trick.

May contain spoilers!!
   4 months ago i was at school and my friend emily was reading these books and i said what is so great about them? And she gave me twilight and i started to read it i am a slow reader so it took me a bout 3 months to read the first half of the book. So i started it again and it took me 2 days to read the book I would have to say then these books stole my heart. I could feel everything bella felt her heart breaking falling in love being confused and it left me for more the next day i bought new moon. 
   I finished that one in 2 days also. I couldnt put it down!! I cried when edward left bella in the woods when she was screaming in the morning when she was gonna try and drown her self i cried even harder when he came back to her well when she saved him from trieing to kill himself. I laught thrugh her friendship with jake and i felt bellas pain when the went to the vultrii (I think that is the wrong spelling i suck at spelling so parden me lol). Felt edward confusion when he couldnt read bells mind.
   then i finished that book and the day after breakling dawn came out i went and bought eclipse and breaking dawn to cuz i new i would finish so fast. I was right i finished eclipse in a little less the 3 days cuz of the lenght. And again i felt bellas pain in the confusion in loveing jake and edward. But yet i knew that bella and edward would never be sepreated again cuz she wouldnt allow that. When vicotoria died i laught my head off right with hers and loved when edward and bella fought over her becomeing a vampire. My favorate part was when she finaly agreed to marrie edward i loved and cried at that part the hardest!! 
   Then after i finished eclipse i picked up Breaking dawn and cried right away thrugh the flash backs of telling charile and the flash backs of telling renee to the wedding it self and of corse the honeymoon bella and her sudceing edward like that i laught so hard!! And when edward was lieing on the floor deu to balla's missed period i was laughing again thrugh her ressting for anyone to remove that baby from her was so funny how rose hoved over her like a hawlk to after bella became a vampire and wanted to rip jakes face off for imprinting on nessie! to her special talents to the groth of nessie and the voultri ant the end to the last words on the last page of the last chapter forever and forever and forever made me cry so hard!!  
   So woith out a doubht this book is the most powerful book i have ever read and loved every minute of it!!! Steph i hope u write another!!!!!! dont be stupid like the other authers and keep there word when they say they r done!!!
I also have to say that the people with the one and to star revies r being stupid this book is fiction not a life event i dont thin k vampires fall in love with humans in real life come on be real people. If steph wanted to have teenaga girls believe in marage and haveing children instead of going to school the she would have made the book about vampires its about love and thahts what counts so steph great book and keep them comeing!!!! This book truely stole my heart!!!

have been able to use ANY gadget right out of the box and have it meet and exceed my expectations. This is a first for me. I opened the box, found a much more compact item than I had expected (smaller and lighter than my Treo), and just turned it on and started using it. 

I was able to use it without even reading instructions, it is quite intuitive. I did not have to worry about saving an accompanying CD with special software. The software is built in the device and downloads itslef, and your videos, onto your desktop into a folder with a normal name like Flip Videos (imagine that!!!). 

So by now I was so excited that I wanted to share, well, guess what? you can email your video to friends right after you download it to your desktop by pluggng the Mino into the USB port of your computer (only little drawback is that you have to know the recipients' emails at this point to use this route for email, later you can just attach it to an email).

I could go on and on, but just get one, you will be so happy you did. Teachers can use this to record lesson (it really does record one hour); students could use it for the same reason; dancers can use it to record their choreography and dance steps; the list goes on, you will figure it out, just like I am figuring it out as I go along.

Enjoy this, its simplicity is just marvelous and the quality of the videos is truly outstanding. Goddbye Sony Minicam!!!!

I've owned a number of Dell laptops, usually getting a new one every two or three years. The past few, however, have been exercises in frustration and despair. Dell's laptop products have been usable, but not exciting in any way - and frankly overpriced in comparison to what others have been offering.

  Want proof? Just look at the HP Pavilion DV4-1140GO (not the most inspiring name) which they label an "Entertainment Notebook PC". The reason for this moniker is because it is "preloaded with Windows Live to make your on-line world as easy as the Windows you already know: you'll get fast access to e-mail, social networking, and chatting. Windows Live services are designed to work seamlessly with each other and a variety of on-line services such as Facebook and Flickr, meaning less work and more fun for you."

  Obviously, an MBA or two who couldn't make the cut at Proctor & Gamble found work at HP. Aside from the silly attempt at branding, the HP Pavilion DV4-1140GO is a workhorse laptop with some very impressive specifications - and some very noteworthy add-on accessories.

  The 1140GO reflects today's emphasis on design, but not to the point of form overwhelming substance. HP has created a package of gentle curves and bright surfaces. Certainly not breathtaking visually, but you won't feel that people will think you shopped the computer bargain basement either. There are a few bits of silliness, such as the illuminated HP logo on the top cover.

  The unit weighs in at just over 5 pounds, a little too heavy in my opinion to be carried comfortably for any period of time, but the young and strong will probably feel differently. On the other hand, the size is right for most roll-ons and shouldn't represent a problem.

  The keyboard is an absolute joy. It is practically full sized and very responsive to the touch. Function keys are slightly reduced in size, but not to the point of being difficult to stroke accurately the first time. There is a row of directional keys (i.e., Page Up, Page Down) on the right hand side, well separated from the main keyboard to keep mistrokes to a minimum. You won't have any lost productivity with this keyboard.

  The touchpad is generously sized. It has a metallic appearance, though on closer inspection it appears to be just an ordinary touchpad. Two large buttons are more than adequate. Unique to my knowledge on the HP is a switch to turn off the touchpad.

  Another indicator of the "entertainment" branding of the DV4-1140GO is the row of touch-sensitive buttons above the keyboard. These provide links to HP's branded CyberLink media and entertainment hub called "Quick Play". It is rather crude with unlabeled icons permitting access to DVD plaback, playlists, video from various sources (including an optional ExpressCard TV Tuner, if installed) and a link library to your favorite games. Frankly, QuickPlay is pretty lame. The button it takes up does not appear to reprogrammable, which is regrettable.

 The remaining buttons on the touch-sensitive bar are mute, volume, scan forward and backward, play/pause, stop and WiFi on and off. The bar is a nice touch and handy, especially for volume adjustments.

  There is only one word to describe the 14.1" Diagonal WXGA High-Definition(8) HP Brightview Infinity Display (1280 x 800): gorgeous.

  Video is bright and crisp with excellent contrast. The screen is highly reflective, which may bother some. Fourteen inches is a reasonable size, though phoo and video editors and power business users would prefer a larger size.

  Finally, the DV4-1140GO incorporates a nifty webcam. The CyberLink "YouCam" software supporting it is juvenile, limited and, overall, lame. But the webcam is capable of pretty good video and should more than sufice for Skype and other web video teleconferencing.

  The Altec-Lansing branded speakers deliver adequate volume for personal listening, but you are not going to fill a large room with them. As with almost all laptop speakers, the sound is tinny with little range and practically no bass. Plug in a pair of headphones, though, and you'll hear every note. In line with the "Entertainment Notebook PC", HP puts two headphone jacks along with a microphone jack on the front edge of the computer, a nice touch if you want to share your media.
  All these goodies would be of little use without ample power under the hood and the DV4-1140GO (geez, I love that name!) does not disappointment in the slightest.

  A 2.00Ghz T5800 Intel Core 2 Duo Processor drives the action on an 800 Mhz bus. For those without a tech background, those are more than decent numbers for most purposes (though not for high-end gaming). The unit comes with 4GB of RAM. (Maximum capacity is 8GB, if you ever want to think of upgrading.) The video adapter is weak: Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 4500MHD. It does okay with most workaday tasks, but isn't up to anything hugely strenuous, like the latest 3D games. HP makes other 1140 models with more sophisticated video adapters.

  This particular model comes with Windows Vista Home Premium SP1 64-bit installed. Almost all major applications will now run under 64-bit Vista, but you may still encounter an application that doesn't. The performance of this computer under Vista 64 is very impressive - I ran some basic benchmark tests and was impressed by its speed. Another advantage of 64-bit Vista is that all 4GB of RAM are addressed. Under 32-bit, only 3 GBs are seen.

  I/O ports, with a couple of exceptions, are pretty much what you would expect:

-3 Universal Serial Bus (USB) 2.0, 3rd port shared with eSATA,
- 2 Headphone out
-1 microphone-in
-1 HDMI
-1 VGA (15-pin)
-eSATA + USB 2.0
-1 RJ-11 (modem)
-1 RJ -45 (LAN)
-1 notebook expansion port 3
-1 Consumer IR (Remote Receiver)

  The eSATA port is a very nice touch and the HDMI port is kind of a "wow" feature. All of the ports are on the left and right sides, the back pane being reserved for the battery.

  Estimated run-time for the included six-cell  battery is average, reports running from 2 to slightly less than 4 hours. Estimating battery life is like herding cats. I don't even bother testing it since everything depends on the load you are running and even temperature - cell capacity drops with the temperature. Easier to carry a spare battery if you're concerned or, like me, just prudent. But HP delivers a very welcome surprise with regard to batteries, which I'll describe in a bit.

  There's a card reader and a neat remote control that fits into the ExpressCard slot, Bluetooth, WiFi and a LightScribe SuperMulti 8X DVD盧/RW with Double Layer Support.

  HP has a couple of things, though, that turn the DV4-1140GO from a solid performer into a stellar machine. The first is a swappable bay. They barely mention this feature in their marketiting material, but you can swap out the DVD for a bay containing up to a 500GB 2.5" hard drive! That is a massive feature for many road warriors or those who like to carry their media library with them. I am surprised HP doesn't push this feature harder, but maybe their market research tells them there aren't many people like me who think this is the cat's meow.

  The second major feature HP doesn't scream about is the availability of a 12-cell battery. A 12-cell battery will last for virtually all of a flight from Chicago to Beijing. Yes, it adds almost 2 pounds to the unit's weight, but you are not going to be carrying it around while in-flight and it stows nicely in your roll-on. The 12-cell also causes the unit's back to sit higher, giving a nice tilt to the keyboard.

  In short, the DV4-1140GO, while labelled an "Entertainment Notebook PC" is really a very capable and exceptionally versatile all-purpose laptop, particularly well suited to business users.

  From my perspective, HP shows in the design of this unit why Dell is losing marketshare. HP packed this unit with lots of usable features at a reasonable price point - and provides reasonably priced add-ons that increase and enhance the computer's useulness.

  All in all, anyone needing a full featured reasonably light laptop computer will find much to like in the DV4-1140GO. For those like me, who often need to carry massive amounts of data and want long battery runtimes, the expansion bay and 12-cell battery are treats you don't often see.

  Overall, this laptop has impressed me and brought me to the point of saying "Hello, HP - goodbye, Dell". I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a solid, all-around laptop.

This Wireless router has been a joy to use. It is easily mountable to a wall and is not an eye sore, especially with light colored walls and the white antenae and casing. It seems to have so many security settings I might consider feeling safe from hacker attempts (but I'm in an apartment complex, so I know better). The Range seems to penetrate walls quite nicely. I can't testify to outdoor use, but my internal PCI card on my laptop just loves this thing, and to give it full bar performance.

Oh, and when draft 2.0 came out? Immediate firmware upgrade, no waiting, just get it done! It also has a lot of customization of ports, a wide range of application specific uses. 

Ok, now for the few negative things, I'm having trouble getting Folding@Home to receive server updates through the firmware. Since it uses http port 8080 for access, it shouldn't have any trouble, but yet it does. I can't find anything on the d-link forum about this either.

The Network magic software is pretty much worthless unless you have XP Home, although I did like how it interacts directly with the d-link router. One BIG negative about this software is that it takes over all print sharing and folder sharing from Windows XP. So unless you kill the software (which always tries to stay running in the background), you can't share a printer or folder the old fashioned way. It won't find it.

I have been using this router for over a year, and I'm very pleased with it. It's very fast and responsive, and offers useful features not found on other routers.
Its DHCP server can be configured to assign specific IP addresses based on MAC address. It also has a very convenient built-in dyndns client, which will update your dyndns.org information everytime it gets asssigned a new IP.
The only criticism I have for this extremely reliable, feature-rich and fast router is that it does not support WDS, and that's why I'm not giving it 5 stars.
WDS is a standard used for extending wireless range, for instance in Apple's Airport Express device. Note that you can still use an Airport Express with this router (I do) but you just won't be able to use it as a range extender.
Considering how inexpensive the WGR614 is, this is a very minor quibble, however if you live in a large house you should consider the Netgear WGT624 instead, which does offer WDS (make sure you update the firmware to the latest version)

Pleased with this shaver.  It is as good as my old Braun from 6 years ago.  The old one still worked, but I lost part of the power cord, so I figured I would treat myself to an new one.  Now I should buy a power cord for my old one so that I have a usable spare.  With regard to the 9595, I only wish it had a cover for the foil for bringing back and forth from my car.   Instead I have to use the travel case which makes it bulkier.   I would buy again.

Wow!  I couldn't believe how much hair I was able to remove. I was enjoying it so much, she got a little impatient with me.

I have owned several Braun products now as I have come to appreciate the reliabilty and beauty in all their products.  While I realize they are more expensive and replacement parts aren't cheap either, I am willing and in a position to pay that in return for a quality, German made product. I have owned two Braun razors as well as a Braun coffee pot and toothbrush. All have been top notch in terms of reliability, ease of operation, and aesthetic appeal. 
 Ideally I would like to buy American made products and avoid buying products made in China, however I have come to realize that most if not all of our American manufacturers have opted for better margins and sent production overseas.

I am giving this DVD a 4 for just coming out.  Disney DVD is the reason I am going DVD. (It was either that or Star Wars!)Anyway, for those of you complaining about the lack of &quot;Widescreen&quot; on this and other  Disney DVDs, read the packaging. &quot;Pinocchio is presented in its  original theatrical aspect ratio, approximately 1:33:1.&quot;  Peter Pan  and 101 Dalmations also say this.  It is not a &quot;full screen/pan and  scan!&quot;  What they saw in the movies then just happens to almost fill  your TV screen now.  Just enjoy!

Great product that performs as well or better than "mainstream" disposables.

The drive was an easy set up. Worked well from the beginning. I've had it running for a month now and I've had no problems. The common issue of fan noise for USB external drives is not a problem with this drive. Upon boot up of the computer the WD drive will make a short buzz sound, and I can hear the fan spool up, but after that, it is really undetectable. I have the drive on the desk with my monitor and other USB devices (camera, scanner, USB hubs, an older 320 MB WD USB drive), only about 30" from my chair.

I trully respect the point of the Secret that you become what you think most of the time, and this video has helped me to be reminded to visualize the best that I have and the best that I want, and it really is helping me in making more money, how? well, I have become more aware of opportunities that were in the past in front of me, and now are leading me to make 100% more income than last year. 

This video has helped me understand why the most important circumsntances in my past were attracted by my thoughts.

I only do not agree about the point of view that the law of attraction combined with myself become like God or creators, because i sincerlly believe that i did not create the world and its echosystem, the fruits and the vitamins they contain to nurture my body (just as an example). 

I see the law of attraction as a world powerful principle as gravety or other invisible law. 

The Secret reminds us to focus in the positive side of life and if you use it as a tool and not just as another video, it will make positive and radical changes to your life. But remember not to lose your sight on the eternal side of life that comes through accepting Jesus as your saver. 

Enjoy it and go for the best!

This review is from: Quantum of Solace [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)

      



QUANTUM OF SOLACE (Q of S) will provide Bond devotees plenty of solace, since to paraphrase Charles Dickens in a single movie Director Marc Forster and writers Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade have managed to capture a lot of the best of Bond while unfortunately mixing in a little of the worst of Bond. It is the season of the most prolonged and action filled chase scenes of any Bond movie, take your choice of car, boat or plane. But at the same time it is the seaon of a villain (Mathieu Amalric cast as Dominic Greene) whose character is more that of an unlikeable sleazeball with a goal that seems terribly underwhelming for an organization as powerful as Quantum, rather than the true evil genius who Bond has so often been arrayed against. (Yes, the title does at least double duty in this film. Quantum is not an acronym, but is the same unnamed criminal organization that was behind events in CASINO ROYALE.) As the first Bond movie to represent a true sequel, while Q of S can be enjoyed as a standalone film it will lose some its impact for moviegoers who have not watched that film and are not aware of the circumstances of Vesper's death and Bond's reaction to it.

 The original Ian Fleming source short story "Quantum of Solace" was first published in Modern Woman / Cosmopolitan magazine in May 1959. It was later included in the book "For Your Eyes Only". This was the first collection of Fleming James Bond short stories and was first published on 11 April 1960. The collection was subtitled "Five Secret Occasions in the life of James Bond" and also included the short stories "From A View To A Kill" and "For Your Eyes Only". Q of S was inspired by a true story in an anecdote told to him by friend, neighbor and one-time lover Blanche Blackwell who received a Cartier wrist watch as gift from him when it was published. According to the short story, the Quantum of Solace is defined as "a precise figure defining the comfort/humanity/fellow feeling required between any pair of people for love to survive. If the Quantum of Solace is 0, then love is dead."

First the movie:  Wonderful musical that is something I'll always love.  The story isn't very deep (do good things, and good things happen to you), but it comes off as fresh even 60 years after it was made.  This is one of  the better Disney movies, putting many of their movies from the 1990s to  shame (such as Pocohantas and Hercules).The DVD:  Image quality is the  best I've seen it.  At first viewing, it seems too washed out, but this is  a movie from 1940, that is the way it originally looked.  And yes, it is  supposed to fill the screen.  Just like the Wizard of Oz, it was not a  widescreen movie.  Audio wise, the soundtrack has been remixed to 4 channel  audio.  It sounds okay, but won't blow you away.  Supplements on the DVD  are very lacking.  Specifically you get a trailer for the movie.  The VHS  edition got a documentary about the making of this film, but that wasn't  included on the DVD.  That is disappointing.  Hopefully more extras could  be discovered and a new edition released sometime in the next few  years.Bottom Line:  One of the best movies available on DVD, not one of  the best DVDs available.

I bought the Furminator and truly love it and so do my dogs.  It works great on my Jack Russell, the Chihauhau and the Black Retriever.  They have never looked or felt better. I told my sister and her husband about it. She went right out and bought it to use on their Pug and their Lab and they are raving about how good a product it is.  I let my neighbor borrow mine to use on her Golden Retriever and they were amazed at how much more of the undercoat comes out using the Furminator.  We all highly recommend this product.

I had been wanting to go wireless for quite a while but was nervous about spending money on something I couldn't get to work.  I took the plunge and it works great!  The instructions were concise, short and accurate.  I got it to work on the first try!!  I can now use our laptop anywhere in the house.  I can also bring my laptop from work and hook right up.

This external hard drive is a great way to plug extra storage into your computer.  The USB 2.0 connection and 7200-rpm spindle speed make it FAST, and it runs very quietly.  The power on/off switch is a nice feature that some external HDDs don't have.  The metal case is sleek and attractive, with a nice little white LED indicator light on the side/top.  I have several external USB-connected hard drives for work and home use, and this one has been the best.  Great product for the money.

I had this kettle for about a month and have been very satisfied with it.  I use it at work, and have it right on my desk.  No smells, it's quick, takes up very little space, and is fairly atractive.

I gave it four, rather than five, stars because it's a little larger than I'd like, I would have perfered all stainless steel, and the cord is about 2" too short to reach a power strip on the floor when placed on a typical desk.

It has truly worked wonders for my howl-loving Beagle. No more barking, no more howling, as soon as the collar goes on he instantly calms down. 

He never tried to "out bark it" - a couple of sprays and he knew the drill. I don't even turn it on anymore, but he knows its there and behaves.

It has not re-trained his barking behavior and I continue to put it on him when going for walks and when he is home alone. This is fine with me, as I wasn't looking to create a silent dog to begin with, I simply wanted to stop the barking at strangers, other dogs and the incessant howling when I wasn't home.  It has worked like a charm.

Now in terms of actual quality, it worked beautifully for a couple of months, now I notice that in order for it to spray I have to refill it every day. My guess is that I dropped it a few times and its leaking. I will definitely buy a new one, and i highly recommend it.

I've had great success with the item.  Yes, I agree that you have to get the instructions out each time you reprogram it.  But since I only have to do that when I changed the batteries (which last for months) and when I was originally setting it up, it really isn't a problem.

You do need to limit it to dry food; I can't see how it would work with moist food at all without gumming up the works.  The minimum is 1/4 cup.  If these don't meet your situation, I'd suggest one of those units where you manually measure out each of the meals for 4 - 8 days.

First electric shaver ever. Researched and went for the best out there according to the critics. Paid good price for new technology and hoped for the best. My beard is average? One thing for sure If I let a day go by it becomes a pain in the arse. Used fussion blades and gillette shaving cream and after several minutes and if the blades are relatively new I would end up, with what is known, as a close shave. Hard to beat and regretfully the Braun Series 7- 790cc (9595) Pulsonic Shaver does not come even as close or better still, is unable to perform as well. Regardless of how many approaches to shaving with this machine I use I do not end up with a smooth surface. Does not conquer basically anything (neck, upper lip, sides of face) but it does clean up the appearance and for that reason I have to give it 4 Stars. Less hassle than pulling the old razor and shaving but not the same results. Like the cleaning unit that is included for it does clean well the shaver. Yes, a little steep priced the liquid but, hey, when you spend over $200 for a shaver you are supposedly able and willing to dish out for the additional convenience and comfort. Every time I finish shaving and I check for smoothness I find there is none, it is not a perfect shave but it does shave enough where for that day you can put a check-mark on the calendar. Sorry I bought it? No. As good as the real deal? No. But I knew that that the razor blade shave is hard to beat. 4 Stars for offering a decent alternative.

pros: lightweight, slim, really portable. Good screen, sufficient amount of USB ports.

cons: two hours battery life is not that much. Windows operation is a kind
of slow. May be one can optimize that but that's what one get out of the box. Keys are small and touch typing will be difficult for the first time.

This was my first wireless network. I also bought the Netgear G notebook card. It took literally 2 minutes to start surfing. All of these people complaining about dropped signals are nuts. I have not had one drop yet. The one guy who could not get it turned on must have not plugged it in or somthing. Go Netgear.

I bought this about 8 months ago - its just what I needed in in a single coffee drinker household. It brews my daily cup well and my favorite part is that it is really convenient to clean. I use a paper filter - Melitta # 1 filters ( also sold on amazon) fit this machine perfectly and make it even easier to maintain.

The product is pretty good as a scale for determining weight. It is visually appealing and well built. It also comes with batteries in the box already which was kind of nice. It is however a pretty inaccurate measurer of body fat percentage. The weight reading is fairly consistant and therefore i recommend it for that purpose but if you want a body fat monitor, look elsewhere.

I recently purchased the Waterpick Ultra and am immensely pleased with it.  It is a vast improvement over older models.  I've used waterpicks for over a decade and found that the older models had flaws.  In particular, the adjustments for the strength of the water flow was too imprecise allowing for vast differences in the force of the jet from one level to another.  The result was that if was impossible to get the strength of the jet just right.  That problem has been corrected in the Waterpick Ultra as the settings are much more sensitive.  Also, I like the design change of putting the waterpick heads in a compartment that is part of the top cover.  Finally, the design is much more compact and aesthetically pleasing.

Some reviewers have stated they prefer the old design--not me.  This one is much better than older models.

I bought the Panasonic SD-YD250 automatic bread maker to replace a Black and Decker B1600 (B&D) for which I could no longer get minor parts. The Panasonic makes a loaf that is shaped more nearly like what most people think of as a loaf of bread: longer than it is high, although its proportions still don't quite match what you would get from baking in a bread pan in a conventional oven or buy at a bakery or grocery store. That's of little importance unless you want just what Mom used to bake at home.

The quality of the loaves I have baked so far has been excellent. I tried a 100% whole wheat loaf using the recipe in the accompanying manual, and as the manual said it would be, it was very heavy and dense. It was OK, but I don't recommend that recipe. I measured the capacity of the bucket in which the ingredients are mixed and baked by filling the Black and Decker's bucket with water and pouring it into the Panasonic's bucket. They were identical in volume, suggesting that I could use the B&D recipes, which I liked, in the Panasonic, and that proved to be true.

The instructions that come with the Panasonic emphasize that all solid ingredients should go in the bucket first, before the liquids. The B&D's instructions were just the opposite and seemed to make more intuitive sense, in that the ingredients would be less likely to be flung over the top of the bucket onto the heating element if the liquid is on the bottom. The first time I used it I followed the Panasonic instructions and indeed a little did fall on the heating element. No harm done, but there was a little smoke and a lump of carbon to remove. I called the Panasonic tech support line, where a representative tried to find out why the instructions were to put the liquids in last. She could not, and said she would have their research department look into it. I never heard from them, so I tried putting the liquids in first, as I had done for a number of years with the B&D, and the results were perfect.

The recipes that come with the Panasonic look pretty good, although I have not yet (four loaves in) tried many of them. One, though, seemed preposterous. It was for rye bread with caraway seeds, which I had made with the B&D for several years using the B&D recipe. The Panasonic recipe called for mostly white flour with only a quarter-cup of rye flour, which seemed more a symbolic gesture than a real attempt at rye bread. Rye flour does not contain much gluten, so a high-gluten wheat flour is necessary to get a decent loaf, but the B&D recipe calls for one cup of rye flour, 3/4 cup of whole-wheat flour, and 2 1/3 cups of (white) bread flour. The Panasonic machine made a better loaf using the B&D recipe than the old B&D machine did, and with a more pleasing shape. I plan to try other loaves using recipes from both machines.

By the way, the Panasonic recipes call for ingredients by weight rather than volume, although recent editions of the manual give approximate volumes for each weight.  Other reviewers have recommended getting a digital scale, which might be a bit more precise, but my experience is that volume measurements work fine.

All in all, the Panasonic is an excellent breadmaker. I'd like to have a window in the top so I could see the progress of the bread, but that's a minor quibble. And if you have used another breadmaker and like its recipes you can almost certainly use them in the Panasonic. Just be sure the capacity of the bucket is the same as that of your old breadmaker, or if it isn't, adjust the recipes accordingly.

Our dog is a runner - we have an acre lot in suburbia and traditional fencing was not an option. We were skeptical about this system because our house is not centered in the lot. 
We found a place to locate the unit so we could use the maximium distance.
As far as training our dog it took 1 day (actually one hour.) He felt the static shock and stayed far away from the flags.
We've had the system for 2 months and he's very familiar w/ the boundaries, no longer needs the flags. He's also comfortable to run full-speed without fear.
He comes and goes as he pleases now - we love it !

All this negative feedback is really depressing so I thought I would put in my own two-cents worth. (SPOILER ALERT) I don't see what all the complaining is about.  Sure, it's not as good as the first novel - but are sequels ever as good.  Why does everybody have such a problem with Bella and Edward living happily ever after?  I understand and agree that when a main character dies at the end, it makes for a powerful ending, but seriously, how can you want Bella and Edward to die.  Isn't it nice to know that they will have 'forever' together?  I think Stephenie Meyer did a fine job and I am excitedly awaiting the Twilight movie and Midnight Sun!!

This product is fantastic.  I've been looking for a backlit keyboard for some time, but this is the first that I've found that really fits my needs.  I do a lot of work in little to no light.  I have no trouble seeing the keys at any of the lighting levels (high, low, and none) and contrary to something I was told, ambient lighting does not pose a problem in the visibility of the keys. 

There are some features from my previous keyboard that I miss.  I had the ability to cut and paste at the touch of a button.  I was also able to log off and shut the computer down with a button, however the convenience of being able to just look down occasionaly to find the key I need without searching in the dark   makes this keyboard worthwhile.

A good entry level monitor. This product is not designed to tell you the whole story. It does, however, give you all of the basic necessary info in an easy to operate and easy to read manner. I have increased my training potential because of this monitor, and I highly recommend using one in your training. I am very pleased with the ease of operation and the large display that is readable without my bifocals while running. The out of zone alarms are handy if you are targeting a workout zone. Overall, I would recommend this monitor for anyone just beginning a workout regimen and wanting to go to the next level of training.

I bought the OMRON HJ-112 pedometer through Amazon.com at $[...].  It's easy to clip on or put in a pocket and has become part of my everyday routine.  The LCD display is easy to read and understand.  The security strap with a little clip helps keep it from getting lost.  I love it and highly recommend it.

The first couple of weeks my wife and I just enjoyed talking about how many steps we had done that day.  Then about a week ago I found the "aerobic STEP" display.   If you walk 60 steps or more per minute for 10 minutes or more the pedometer displays this as "aerobic" steps.   Walking articles suggest 30 minutes a day of "aerobic" walking.  With the pedometer you can record an easy pace of 60-80 steps per minute for 30 minutes during a lunch break.  Or split it into two sessions of 15 minutes and let the pedometer add them together.  The picture I uploaded shows 3396 aerobic steps I did 5 days ago.  It took me 34 minutes so that's about 100 steps a minute.  For me 100 is a very easy pace to maintain (on level ground, good shoes, etc.) but even a slower 60 a minute is perfectly OK.      

So thanks OMRON for adding this much needed activity to my life and helping me measure it.  Gadgets are great and this one is highly recommended.  $[...] is a real bargain for such proven health benefits.

I recently found that my old and (more than just slightly) outdated laptop was running low on storage space. Granted, the laptop still ran fine. I considered getting a new laptop but soon realized I'd be spending a whole lot of money to replace something that wasn't broken. A friend told me that he'd run into the same problem and instead of spending a small fortune so he could have 2 of something he only needed one of he bought an external hard drive. I heeded  his advice and did some looking around and eventually settled on the same one he had gotten. I'd heard nothing but good news about it from him and now that I've got the same one I'm inclined to agree. Its simple, portable, has more than twice the memory of my laptop, and (probably my deciding factor) doesn't require an outside power source. All in all, I couldn't be happier with it.

I have two of these gates - used to keep dogs in or out of certain areas. They are fabulous under normal circumstances. However, if a squirrel is spied, all bets are off for the gate staying in the door frame! The gate is flattened, the dogs are off and mom gets to pick up the gate and redo the normally good tension bolts. I really do love them and that is why I bought two of them. I do think they would work better if I had poodles, or chihuahuas - who would not jump them at the slightest squirrel sound, or push them down at the first inkling of squirrel in a neighbour's tree. (Of course the little dears, (squirrels, not dogs) know they are not welcome in our garden, so they stay just out of reach to simply  tease the dogs.) If I keep the squirrels really quiet (sure... easy to do!!), the gates are wonderful in keeping my Ridgebacks out of trouble. I am glad I have them and I have since had several dog friends (with better trained dogs) buy them too. Great product!

The GB here stands for Giga(Billion) BYTES. Bytes are numbers in the "binary system(base 2)" that can be composed of only 2 numbers 0 and 1(hence binary or base 2). This is very unlike to what most people are familiar with - the decimal system(base 10) where numbers from 0-9 are allowed.

The base here means, you can write any number as the base number of the system raised to some power. i.e.,
to write 1000(in decimal/base 10), one will write 10^3 (in your calculator. Hit 10, then x^y and then 3).
OR say, the number 53 = 10^1.724

The closest number to 1000, in binary(base 2), is 2^10 = 1024. (Note 2^9 = 512). If one has to write 1000, as a power of 2, one will have to write 2^9.966  -- obviously not a very neat thing to write and not very easy to remember as well. Hence, the community has settled for 1024(in binary) as a standard for 1 Kilo (or 1000)

Now Kilo is (10^3), Mega is 1000*Kilo(10^6), i.e. Mega=(Kilo)^2 

and Giga is 1000*Mega(10^9)i.e., Giga = (Kilo)^3. 

Since Kilo in binary is 1024, Giga in binary is (1024)^3 or 2^30.

If you thus divide 500GB/2^30, you will find the (so far) utterly confusing number 465GB! However if you go to properties and look at what the number is in "bytes" it will give a number like 499,289,9..... bytes.

I hope this makes it clear.

PS: It is another thing that your file system or formatting might take up some space. But your DRIVE does come with 500G BYTES.

This by far has been the best mini-series creation blessed by the Sci-Fi people, and yet, I can't help but feel a bit let down by the fact that the relationship has ended so soon.  Also with much bitterness that these episodes must be dragged out soooo long as to make me finally lose interest in watching the episodes altogether until they have all been released for download where I can watch them at my leasure and without the inconvenience of waiting months/year for my next fix.  Your game, not mine.

I am glad in a way that this is the last season, but it comes with a bittersweat lingering as well as I come to the realization that something as brilliant as this may never get another chance to be furthered.  I remember during the whole Dune phase and to have ended with the Children of Dune was a huge disspointment.

It took a while, so be patient.  We initially placed the fountain near their food bowls, and while it didn't deter them from eating (very little deters them from eating), it also didn't encourage them to drink.  When I moved it to the bathroom counter and steadfastly refused to turn the sink faucet on, my boy gave in and started drinking from the fountain.  I haven't actually seen my girl drink, but my husband has.  
The noise level is really nothing at all, in fact, when the fountain was in the kitchen, the refrigerator motor was louder than the fountain motor!  It's more noticeable in the bathroom, but nowhere near intolerable unless the water level is low.  Then it really does produce some truly unique vibrations.
I've cleaned it couple of times now with no issues other than forgetting how to get the flow control back on.  It's fairly intuitive, so a little fidgeting and we're back in business.  The benefits of not being woken at 3:00am by a yowling, thirsty Siamese who wants the faucet turned on far outway any nuisance.

I've read all the books and now I've seen the show. I have to say, though I may be one of the few, I prefer the show. For me, Paquin's Sookie is MUCH more likable than the Sookie in Harris' books. Paquin plays "Crazy Sookie" very well, and shows a lot of emotional vulnerability that makes her character believable, which I've never noticed in my several readings of the books. In the books, though, she's just crazy and ignores a lot of good advice, and is very self-involved, never thinking about other people having reasons for doing the things they do.

Maybe my favorite change from the books to the series is that it's not all about Sookie. Other characters also get attention, and their own storylines, which makes the show that much more interesting to watch. On top of that, Stephen Moyer is an INCREDIBLE Bill with very real issues that show up in his personality. I look forward to dealing with the issues Bill has that were set up in the last episode of season 1 when the show comes back for season 2.

I can't wait to continue watching this show next season. I'm sure it will be great! And as for the books, I do agree that reading them is a good thing, but I completely prefer Harris' other book series over the Stackhouse series. For me, that series is bland, and underwritten, especially compared to her Aurora Teagarden series.

I found this documentary to be a wonderful thing for our times right now. As an Atheist myself, I have been fascinated by the blanket-like hatred and intolerance shown towards Atheist in this country. I feel that most members of main-stream religions are allowed to show bigotry and severe judgment towards members of other religions, the homosexual community and atheist simply because their faith doesn't allow or agree with the opposition. The moment an Atheist smirks and starts asking questions or blatantly disagreeing with these religions they are immediately branded as ignorant or hateful and told to just "be quiet!"
Bill Maher presents an interesting, funny and sometimes frustrating (in the attitude of the people being interviewed) program where the members of a handful of religions are simply asked basic questions about the history/mythology of their faith. The documentary seems fair minded and balanced. I really like the group of Christian truckers at the beginning of the show who didn't really have an answer to Bill Maher's questions but did not act hateful or dismissive of him. In fact, Mr. Maher thanked them for being Christ-like. Mr. Maher's unapologetic questioning about the Christian church's homophobia is an extremely brave action considering how powerful the Christian Right's anti-gay agenda is in this country (read Prop 8). That being said, I'm an Atheist living in a VERY religious country so, of course I like it. As to how many Christians, Mormons, Jews, etc who watch this and will like it? I doubt many. And that is their right. Just as it is my right to say that I thought this was great!

This review is from: Pinocchio (Disney Gold Classic Collection) (DVD)

      



I first saw this movie as a child some sixty-five years ago and have always remembered it fondly.  Now, having my first grandchild, I began to wonder if it was really as good as I thought it was and if my granddaughter might enjoy seeing it too.

What a joy!  Walt Disney's Pinocchio is everything I remembered it to be.  The musical score is enchanting and the art work superb.  Truly remarkable, the art work, drawn by true craftsmen, makes modern computer graphics look shallow and sickly by comparison.  The principle characters are equally well done and charmingly presented.  And, best of all, Pinocchio's story carries with it three important moral lessons which every child should learn: If you want to be a real boy [or girl] you must listen to your parents and let your conscience be your guide; if you tell a lie it will be as plain as the nose on your face; and if you don't follow your conscience and mind your parents, you'll most likely go astray and make a jackass of yourself.

This is simply a great film and a great story with a great message, and is suitable for viewing by every child and child at heart from the age of five to at least one hundred and five.  Too bad the limit is five stars.  This film and those who made it certainly deserve much more.

Reading through the first twenty-or-so reviews, I noticed the same ideas repeated again and again, all of which are perfectly true:1: Yes, it's a comic book, but that's like saying Citizen Kane is just a movie.2: Most people will be likely to push away this book if you offer it to them because of all those silly pictures that stop it from being a novel. Should they do this, point out the little details hidden away in each scene (the recurring image of the smiling face, for example) or the way that Gibbons' art - although damned by the use of block colouring that makes it look like a mid-70s X-Men book - is so expertly detailed with each individual person in the background moving realistically (ie: the people in the background don't appear/disappear between frames).3: Moore's story is complex and thoughtful and, although it can be confusing, rewards re-reading.4: Despite the superhero costumes, the characters in this book are... real. They're complex people who have emotions and characterizations comparable to the finest literature. Someone mentioned that Rorschach is in the same psychotic league as The Punisher, but whilst the latter has an almost stereotypical excuse for being a murderer (his wife and kids were killed by gangsters), Rorschach's driven by much more complex reasons (growing up in an unstable home where his mother was a prostitute etc.). And all of the characters are like this; people with pasts and futures and emotions.Truly excellent.

I wanted the Iphone but choose the Touch because I didn't want to go through the hassle of transfering from Verizon to ATT since I had a year or so left on my contract and I was pleased with my present phone.  
The touch finds any wireless networks easily and connects to them when they are open.  I recommend the touch for anybody in a similar situation.

I love this tooth brush. My dentist told my I was brushing too hard manually and cutting grooves in my enamel. With this unit I don't need to use as much pressure to feel clean. I can't wait until my next check up to see how I am doing. I like the 2 min timer.

I have only owned the product for a short time (and used it about a dozen times), so I can't say how well it'll last.  But the honeymoon phase is in full effect!  I love this machine; the only machine in my house I love more is my TV.  It is solid and heavy, and doesn't move around when you use it.  Normally I dislike loud machines (and trust me, this baby is loud), but the sheer awesomeness of its blending power is best expressed through its growling noise.  Ice cubes?  BAM! crushed at the speed of sound.  Smoothies? Shakes?  Bring it ON! 

I love the simplicity of "blend" versus "pulse"; fifty different speeds rarely produce fifty different results and I hate the clutter of a lot of buttons on front.  The switch feels solid and well made; i dislike buttons or dials because they always seem poorly made.

I also prefer that the jug is glass (which doesn't stain, works better w/ hot foods, and is non-stick).  The blades also separate from the jog, which makes it easier to clean, and in the future (when dulled) easier and cheaper to replace.  The lid is nice and tight, although the grip isn't the most effective for pulling it off the jog.

I definitely recommend this blender....with the caveat that I've only owned it a short time.

It works exactly how it should.  And I'm going to respond to some comments that almost caused me not to buy the thing.

1.  Can't get an accurate measure because of 1" intervals.

a) You're using it wrong.  The intervals are to keep it from recoiling on it's own as you're pulling it out.  When you press the button to recoil, there are no intervals.  (hint: read the directions)  Also, this gave the same measurements as a standard tape measure.

2.  Broken out of the box, bad clicking noise.

a) It's a feature, not a defection.  See answer above.  You can also hold the button as you pull it out to avoid the clicking, but release the button when you're done so it doesn't recoil before you're ready.

3.  The pin keeps falling out.

a) I don't know if it was the company's intention, but I see this as a feature.  The only time it pops out is if the tape isn't straight and/or flush, which would give an inaccurate measurement anyway.

I've had one of these for quite a while and I'm going to order another one when I finish typing this.
I have had more hubs then I can count, and this is by far the best.  Other have gone nuts (a serious technical term).
After a month or two one or more ports would have random outages and I could make no sense of what was going on.  I have been using PCs since the first month they were released and the other hubs drove me crazy (short trip).
This unit, however, just sits there and does what It is supposed to do.  
And this price is great.  It is over $50.00 on the company web site.

Too bad I didn't have this book years ago.  I ended up figuring out some of his best techniques in the book on my own just one year ago -- but before reading this book-- maybe that's why he calls them common sense-- you'd probably figure them out on your own eventually-- but the book will help many people figure it out sooner. After years of different systems, planners, notebooks, and finally the palm pilot.  I agree with Allen that the palm is too slow for input. Finally, I have everything I need to do on index cards in my wallet.  One for recurring tasks, one for priority tasks and one for projects. I have them organized by context as David recommends-- errands, computer, phone calls, and things I need to do at home with the next actionable steps.  The only card that needs frequent updating is the priority one. The only other lists I have is a grocery list and a phone list also on index cards (one card for each list.  I also keep a tiny month-to month calendar (the free hallmark ones) in my wallet. They are easy to refer to on the go and update them as needed.  

The only thing that I'm not quite sure I agree on from the book and some reviews is emphasis on bottom up rather than top down.  Perhaps this works better while on a job, but not for organizing personal things in my opinion. Having the top down priorities established helps establish and simplify the number of things that I decide to even attempt to embark on.  For example, as a stay-at-home mother of two children ages one and three pretty much simplifies my priorities for the time being. Deciding to go with only organic food simplified my grocery list. Deciding that a priority is educational and creative things for my son has changed my project list to include crafts and projects that we can do together etc.  I think a simultaneous top down, bottom up approach seems to work best for me.  The only reason some top down only approaches probably don't work is that they don't include the concept of the "next actionable step" and perhaps they encourage too lofty undoable goals that don't fit into your state in life and vocation.  The other problem with emphasis on top down is that as life changes, priorities change-- and these days that can happen quite often and unexpectedly. Marriage/divorce, moving, death/illness, birth, career change. Of the big five stressors two of them-- moving and job change can happen an average of every three years for the average person.  It always seems to me that as soon as I get myself organized a major life event happens to change everything again. 
Two things that I have found out help me keep stress out of my life are: 
Authenticity and Simplicity. You end up having less lists and less on your lists. I'd like to see an organizing book built around those ideas.

This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series (DVD)

      



Ok... So far I've only watched the first 4 chapters, so let me comment about them:

Chapter 1 was kinda boring. Let's face it, we've all seen so many extraordinary movies lately that it's difficult to impress us. It's more like a general introduction of what you're gong to see in the whole series, so this lack of coherency made me... go asleep a couple of times.

From chapters 2-4 seem the series seems to get better and better with each coming chapter. At first, you might think: "I see nothing extraordinary in these shots... They have shots like these all the time in everyday cable TV"... But when you watch the mini "making of" at the end of each chapter, you come to really appreciate the effort put to make even a shot a few seconds long. And when you turn on your cable box again you realize that the shots in everyday cable aren't really that great. Ad you come to realize that this series has some places and animals you hadn't even heard about.

Now, if I think the series is so good (after a Zzzzzz first chapter) Why did I gave it just 4 stars? Because of the way the DVDs were made. 

My first gripe: The BBC makes you sit and watch through tons of ads of their other programs, and there are a few logos, too. In total, you have to skip to "next" 5 TIMES to finally get to the menu every single time you put the DVD in your player.

2nd gripe: The boxing (at least the regular DVD edition one) is made of cardboard, and quite flimsy. Yes, it might look cool with the transparent plastic holding each DVD and everything, but I really feel that I must get these five discs out of this box NOW if this box is to survive another month. I hope they make an edition with regular DVD boxes in the future. I'll post a pic of the box soon...

3rd gripe: There's this company called "2 entertain"... well, thanks to these guys every single disc in the collection has a giant 2 on it, which is quite confusing. The real disc number is harder to find in the darkness of a home theater...

Now, I expect to be attacked by an angry mob. Leave your comments!

I have never owned a food processor before, and I am ecstatic to have this one!  I read in other reviews to be sure to pulse when you are operating this particular food processor b/c it will puree your veggies if the button is held down continuously for an extended period.  (However, I don't really have a problem with my veggies being pureed.  It makes my 3 year old more likely to get more veggies in without knowing it!!)

This device makes prepping for a meal soooo much easier and quicker.  I set it up right beside the stove and keep an extra bowl handy in case I need to store some of the ingredients while chopping up others.  My cutting board is getting so lonely!

The adapter worked after the install with no problems. The range is almost as good as I get with the dell factory one my wife has in her laptop. Once in a while it will not find the wirless hub when it is in standby for a few hours. All you need to do is remove the adapeter and put right back in the USB port and it syncs up just fine. Good buy for the money.

It's quick for a vinaigrette: blends basil, oregano, and garlic into the oil and vinegar. Ok a little basil may be missed. But it beats cleaning up the blender.  It does not splash.  The mixing container is ideal.And cleanup is easy. One warning: I think it might be easy to put a finger where the blade is while it is still plugged in. That could be ugly.

We're thinking the old BBQ out on the patio has met it's match.  This grill is fantastic... the fact that all the grease drips into the water below makes for quick clean ups.  There truly is virtually no smoke, and with 200 square inches of cooking space there is no need to crowd the food.  We highly recommend this particular grill (and we are tough critics).

If you've got either an HD DVD or Blu-Ray player, get this series and be amazed at the picture. I just wish it had the Sigourney Weaver naration instead of David Attenbourough's. He does a good job, but I really like Sigourney.

I bought the maker for making my own low carb yogurt. I have found it works great with the new Carb Countdown milk, as well as with goat's milk for the kids. I would like to buy a glass mason jar with a tight lid for the container though, but so far the plastic one included has worked fine.I have only had 1 batch of yogurt turn out bad, but I think that was more my fault for quick cooling the milk and doing a few other things differently. I love being able to make my own yogurt at home. Not only does it save me money, I belive having the choice of my own sweetners and avoideing addatives and preservatives is good for the health of the whole family.

I had an old one and after many, many years the motor finally burnt .. theo ne thing that would have been nice to know in advance was whether this one will be compatible with the accessories from my previous one  (also called smartstick but different model, color etc) ... I ended up purchasing the whole set with attachments "just in case", but in retrospect could have just gotten the main stick replacement as it does fit with other pieces.

Omron, hands down makes the best pedometer.  About three years ago I purchased their model 112. I wore it intermittantly at first.  But then I started to wear it more regularly.  For the past year and a half I have worn their pedometer almost everyday.  When the 720ITC came out I had to have one because the computer interface could replace my tracking in a spreadsheet.  I used it for about 6 months and the battery died.  I installed a new battery, it worked correctly (measuring steps, etc) but it wouldn't upload to my PC.   I called Omron and they told me to send it back to them with $5 for shipping and handling.  Before I sent it back I purchased second one, because I didn't want to be without.  Once I received the new one I sent the broken one back to Omron and they replaced it, no questions asked.  Now I have two.  But that's ok.  I'll keep it as a spare or give it as a gift.
 - If you have a gut that hangs over your belt the pedometer will get knocked off your belt from time to time while bending over. - damhik -   Now that I have lost some weight it isn't a problem any more.
 - It does work on an eliptical machine.  
 - I have found the step (regular and aerobic) tracking to be very accurate.
 - Mileage - is only going to be as accurate as your setting.  It will give you a good average.  But if I'm walking at a more brisk pace (longer strides) I will have gone farther than the reading.  I don't think that is a bad thing.
 - I have ignored the calorie stats.
Overall I am very happy with mine.

I'd been looking for an electric kettle for a while and finally decided on the Breville Ikon. I liked the stainless steel, simple design, and stylish looks of this particular kettle. When I actually received the kettle, I was surprised by the actual heft of the kettle and the handle-it felt good in my hand. As mentioned in other reviews, there is a taste of plastic in the water (from the lid?), but with regular use over the weekend, that seems to have disappeared. The blue backlight is also very handy, but the chime that signals the water is done really can't be heard over the boiling and the switch turning itself off. Overall, I think this kettle was worth the money as I use it several times a day.

After going through several different brands of coffee makers in the past year and a half, the first one being a different model Cuisinart that we promptly returned to Costco, and reading about 200 reviews on this one, we purchased one last evening. We followed all the setup instructions as shown in the manual. Then we programmed it to make 10 cups at 5 this morning. The first thing I noticed was that it didn't wake me up as all the other one's did. When the alarm went off, I awoke to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. After pouring the first cup and tasting it, I knew we made the right decision. The coffee was hot and tasted very good. No hint of plastic taste as was the case with all the other ones. So it is a keeper. I hope it lasts longer than some have reported. First impression, very good!!

Overally, good drive.  Far superior to the WesternDigital drives IMO.

I used this in a tropical rainforest under far from ideal (or rated) conditions.  No problems.

The good: 

Seagate harddrive inside... quiet, fairly fast, fairly reliable, good quality.

The bad:

Enclosure design could be nicer.  The "base" part makes it more annoying to travel with than need be.  The funky asymmetric shape wastes some space.  The light is pretty, but the slow "pulse" is not a very clear/obvious indicator of access and it is only visible from the left.  

Also, there are the normal difficulties with USB based "on/off" sensing.  Power switches are not a bad thing!  Your computer goes to sleep (or any other condition where USB is powered down), and the drive will shutdown.  Unfortunately, it isn't very likely to wake back up when the computer does... just pull the cable and reinsert works most of the time.  I'm using it with ext2 (linux) filesystem with no real problems, though I do have to umount/mount on the command line (no autodetect) after the sleep problems (not unique to this drive).

It would be nice if the case was redesigned... put the power circiuts in that front asymmetric part instead of the base, and make the base just a removable "dock" with power and usb plugs passing through (so you don't actually need it unless you are setting the drive on its edge).

The design isn't significantly worse or better than anything else I've seen out there.  However, the actual seagate harddrive inside makes the FreeAgent series the one to buy IMO.

At first I was amazed at all of the bad reviews for BSG but then I realized there has to be a fan base for Stargate type SciFi and therefore bad taste is rampant. Then after reading I became surprised at the overwhelming amount of good reviews. It's good to see this series getting the recognition it deserves. BSG is one of the smartest, grittiest and engrossing series on TV these days. 

I was a fan of the original series when I was a kid too but when I watch it today I can tell it was written for kids. As I remember there were 2 incarnations of the original series; the 1st being pretty good and the 2nd being space disco. 

If you go by science alone the new series is great. The sound in space is not completely gone :( but it is muffled simulating the inside of a cockpit. They don't use lasers which would be a poor weapon. The robots can actually move instead of shuffle and they don't have the intelligence of a poodle. 

But the most successful rewrite is Baltar. The original series never explains why a person would betray the human race. It would have to be a strong motive. The revamped Baltar is believable, if a bit pathetic, and STARBUCK IS A GIRL!!. Who cares? She's a great character. 

This is a great show. Get over your selective childhood memories. The original was endearing but hokey. The new show stands on its own.

I have had a Belkin Pre N router for the last 3-4 years (I think).  For the last 12 months it has been less than stable, needing to be reset multiple times per day, making downloads like product updates practically impossible to complete.  My home has 3 floors, with a MacBook Pro, 1 wired HP Printer, 2 wired desktops, 1 wireless desktop, an IPhone, a Wii, a Tivo and a DS looking to connect to the internet via my Comcast cable.

I looked at the reviews, and this Belkin N+ router looked very good.  So, I ran out and purchased one yesterday.

I followed the instructions and my equipment connected and found the wireless, pretty easy and quickly.  I then decided to run the installation CD on my laptop to set up a new name and set a password.  This process was a little problematic, but I think that was because I was trying to do it over a wireless connection.  Within 45mins everything was set up and working.  It did help to have had a Belkin in the past, so I was familiar with the process.

So far so good.  It's working like a charm and I have had NO need to reset the device.

So what do I like?  Speed, reliability, stability, excellent coverage and the Guest feature.

What do I not like? Nothing so far.  Given other reviews, I fear contacting Belkin support, but have had no need to try.  Nor have I tried the attached storage.  If I do experience problems, I will try and update this review.

Product was shipped on time and arrived as advertised - all works great ......... we were worried initially with the coffee maker as the first few cups of coffee had a metallic taste, but after cycling water thru  a few times it tasted normal. We love the coffee maker - very convenient.  Glad we purchased the larger model with a bigger tank of water - would have taken too many refills with a smaller capacity tank....... wish there would have been a non-commercial product line that had an option to connect to a water line.

We love the little individual cups of coffee and the variety. I have found that it's easy to cut the top off the used cup, wash it out and put any brand coffee in it. Then I cover with a round piece of aluminum foil as a cap - works great........ a lot better than the individual cup holder we purchased........  only trick is to line up the puncture hole on bottom when inserting the cup in the holder.

This is the Batman movie I like the most. So real, like the Spiderman ones which for a moment or two you feel worry for his personal problems and fear for his safey that the hero "may" die. So noble, that Batman and his comrades resolved to law and justice despite the loss of love and power. However, I cant help but ask the following question, "Can there be someone on Earth with this absolute self control and faith not to make things right with their own hands whilst facing such big evil (and risk)!" No matter what, this movie is both philosophical and entertaining. Recommended!

Perhaps that is par for the course for these types of food processors, but I was a bit surprised to find that many things have to be chopped into 1/2 inch size pieces before you put it into this Mini-Prep Food Processor.  I can dice an onion into uniform 3/8 inch pieces and clean the cutting board and knife in less time than it takes for me to dice them into 1/2 inch pieces and then put it in the processor and make a shredded pile of onions, and then clean out the processor or put it in the dish washer. I'm sure there are things that this does that I can't do or faster than I can do it, like grinding spices or coffee, but I already had a coffee grinder.

In summary, I'd still give it a 4 because it is made well, and is versitle, and finely minces things faster than I can with a knife, without losing fingertips:)

The product works great and is very simple to hook-up. I think the design could be a little better though. I do like the grippy feet pads and, for the most part, the narrow AC power adapter plug-in.  The plug-in fits well into a power strip but would stick out quite a bit if plugged into a wall socket, luckily I use a power strip. What I didn't like was the way all of the USB ports were on one side of the device while the power connection and the USB upstream port are on the other side of the device. Not a big deal, but because the wires are sticking out of opposing sides, it is hard to hide the Hub or fit it into tight spaces. I think it would be more functional if all plug-ins were on one side of the device (Top would be ideal) or perhaps only 90 degrees apart (front & side as opposed to front & back). The configuration of the plug-ins is something I didn't consider when I went looking for a USB hub. If I had it might have influenced my decision to purchase this product. All-in-all: Thumbs-up!

I purchased an Artisan mixer (citron) 2 years ago and can't believe how much I've used it. Yes, it looks good sitting on the counter, but it has earned the right to take up valuable space since I turn it on almost every day. I was fortunate to also purchase the ice cream maker and food grinder. These tools have revolutionized how I cook and greatly expanded the variety of foods coming from my kitchen. A friend gave me the book The Mixer Bible for my birthday and now my husband has to use a crow bar to pry me from that mixer. I had no idea a book and a machine could change my life to such a degree. I'm busy cooking my way through it to my family's delight. I purchased the pasta roller about a year ago and make fresh pasta weekly. So far the Tuna Burgers with Asian Slaw are a big hit and the Plum Upside Down Cake is a regular stand in for dessert after Sunday dinners. There are lots of pasta recipes to try along with ice creams, sausages and great breads, rolls and cake recipes. If you already have a mixer, by all means, pick up an attachment or two along with the Mixer Bible. You'll be glad you did.

I remember seeing Toy Story that cold winter of 1995 and thinking, "This movie is great. We need more like this!" Thanks to John Lasseter and the rest at Pixar, we get a quality animated family film almost every year! Even at their worst, Pixar puts out more quality than other studios. And now the give us Wall-E. A story about a lovable little robot, left behind and forgotten about, who is just doing his job and getting through. His life gets exciting when Eve, a recon robot looking for life on Earth, shows up. A friendship ensues and adventure follows when Wall-E follows Eve back to a spaceship carrying what remains of the human race.
The human race has now become completely dependent on machines and robots for everything. When Wall-E, Eve and a sign of life on Earth show up, everything goes crazy!
This movie is sweet, emotional, funny and very smart. Not only does it make you care for a robot who barely says 5 words the whole movie, but it also has makes a commentary on both environmental issues and how we are growing more dependent on technology without being preachy. This is another winner from the wizards at Pixar!

I echo and validate most of the other opinions about this product: This product is efficient, fast, powerful, easy to use, and makes great juice.  It's also handsome enough to leave on the countertop.  I use it every morning, I love it, and I recommend it without hesitation or reservation.

I also agree with those who've written that it's "easy to clean" -- in the sense that the parts are dishwasher safe and don't require any MUSCLE to clean them.  However, in the spirit of full disclosure, "easy" doesn't necessarily mean "fast." Not including the pitcher, after each use, there are four parts that need to be rinsed, and there's a filter that needs to be brushed thoroughly.  It probably takes me 4-5 minutes to rinse all of the parts and brush the filter each morning.  For me, that isn't a prohibitively long or inconvenient period of time.  However, it might be prohibitively inconvenient for some people.  So, that's something that you might want to consider before you drop $300-$400 on this product.

For people who've never bought a juicer before, it's also worth noting that this is a literally a "juicer" and not a "blender."  So, it doesn't chop or crush ice, and it isn't really the best product for making smoothies.

Good Workout for beginners or advanced exercisers.  Yoga was recommended to me by my back doctor to strengthen an injury, but I hate doing non-workout workouts.  This DVD (if you do all 5 segments) is a good workout with instruction to make it even harder.  Bob is not at all annoying (like the Denise Austin videos).  Bought copies for my mother and mother in-law.  You will need 3lb or 5lb dumbells once you get comfortable to make the moves harder.

Moore used the story as a means to reflect contemporary anxieties and to deconstruct the superhero concept. Watchmen takes place in an alternate history United States where the country is edging closer to a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. After government-sponsored superhero The Comedian is found murdered, the vigilante Rorschach warns his former colleagues of what he believes is a conspiracy to kill costumed heroes. As the story progresses, the protagonists discover that one of the heroes has devised a plan to stave off war between the United States and the USSR by carrying out a plan that will kill millions of innocent people.

Creatively, the focus of Watchmen is on its structure. Gibbons used a nine-panel grid layout throughout the series and added recurring symbols such as a blood-stained smiley face. All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series' backstory, and the narrative is intertwined with that of a another story, a fictional pirate comic titled Tales of the Black Freighter, which one of the characters is reading.

WATCHMEN, Mickey Mouse and THE TWILIGHT ZONE are the three biggst pop culture phenomenons of the 20th Century. James Bond comes close, but the franchise has yet to reach maximum potential. Amazon.com does offer THE TWILIGHT ZONE: UNLOCKING THE DOOR TO A TELEVISION CLASSIC by Martin Grams Jnr. which covers the entire series with 800 plus pages of behind-the-scenes trivia, exclusive interviews with cast and crew and a detail level will exceed anyone's expectation. Amazon also offers KISS KISS, BANG BANG by Alan Barnes and Marcus Hearn, which is a geek's shrine to all things James Bond. Buy both books and THE WATCHMEN and you will see the world through another vision.

The lighting for my home office area is very poor.  I've tried a couple of desk lamps, but they are either too far away to be effective or they are right in the middle of my limited workspace.  This keyboard is the perfect solution!  There is plenty of backlighting for me to easily see the keys (especially when trying to find numbers, symbols, etc), and the keys feel great!  Easily as good or better than my Dell Keyboard.

Other reviews here go into great detail on what it does and how so I wont cover that ground again. I have had this for over a year now and it works great. Does not loose any connectivity and never has to be restarted even when there is a power outage or surges and I have to restart the other routers and switches. Looks like this one was built for the long haul.

Although not great, the Canon HV30 is a generally very good camera for it's price range.   Outdoor day footage is fantastic, indoor footage is so-so.  I find it grainy and you really have to move this camera slowly to prevent weird effects you won't like too much.


Editing:

I edit with Avid on a PC at work, and hate everything about it.   I didn't buy this camera for work and hope to never attach it to a PC.   At home, I own a PowerMac G5 (which uses PowerPC processors, not Intel).  The computer is still running, so I don't plan to buy a newer computer anytime soon.  That is one reason why I bought this tape-based camera.  I wanted it to work with relatively older computers with no headaches.    Many reviews say that the other camcorder storage mediums can actually take longer to get footage onto your computer than MiniDV!   Also, most Hard Disk and card camcorders won't work with Power PC processors (found in older Macs).


iMovie 2008 had no problem recognizing the Canon Vixia HV30 when using a Firewire (IEEE 1394) cable (which I had to buy seperately).  If your computer doesn't have a Firewire (IEEE 1394) port, then I don't think you can import any video footage onto your computer with the USB cable.  It seems like the USB connection option is for the still pics only.  

Importing and editing HD footage was no problem with iMovie '08.  However, I couldn't get  iMovie '08 to import SD footage.  Maybe there is a setting I couldn't find, but it seems like iMovie expects you to only import HD footage when it recognizes your Canon Vixia HV30.  iMovie imports SD footage without problems with my older SD-only video camera (Panasonic PV-GS250). 

Final Cut Pro:  I had no issues importing and editing anything with Final Cut (again with a  Firewire (IEEE 1394) cable).  Final Cut doesn't try to figure out the brand name and model of your camcorder like iMovie does.  

HD 60i, HD 24p, HD 30p, and both SD settings worked well.  But I had to use Easy Setup to tell Final Cut what type of footage I was planning to import ahead of time.  Final Cut doesn't detect it automatically.  

I could even mix all these types of footage clips onto the same timeline.  That's great.  I didn't try that with iMovie.

iDVD: I didn't try burning edited footage to a DVD yet, but I doubt iDVD will have any issues.  I can't wait for Blu-Ray burners and discs to become readily available.   That's another reason why I chose a tape-based camera.  Your tapes will contain your stored HD footage as an inexpensive master copy.

Avid Xpress:  I have it for my Mac as well, but I don't want to be bothered trying to use it with my Canon Vixia30.   If ever I do, I will update this review.

iPhoto had no problem understanding the Canon Vixia HV30's still photos when using a USB cable (provided with camera).

iChat:  I was able to use this camcorder as a webcam, but only when I set it for DV. iChat wouldn't acknowledge the camcorder when it was set for HD.  Not that I expect the internet to be in HD, but if this camera only shot in HD, then I would lose out on being able to use it as a webcam.  Also, I had to attch the camcorder to my Mac with a Firewire (IEEE 1394) cable in order for iChat to recognize it.



CONS:

Indoor image quality is a grainy.  It is not horrible, but you definitely will notice it.  Also, maybe I have a wrong setting but when I move the camera during indoor shooting, image quality gets bad.  Images seem to stutter/freeze for an instant.  It doesn't matter whether I recorded at 60i, 24p or 30p.  But 60i reduced the problem. I can see this problem quite easily when hooking the camera up to my 42 inch LCD 1080p TV with an HDMI cable (HDMI cable not included with camcorder).  Had I watched my footage on a regular TV with RCA cables, maybe I wouldn't notice the stutter/freezing as much...but then why buy an HD camera???  I did play around with the slow shutter feature to disable it, but it only helped the problem a little.

Outdoor image quality is much better, but again moving the camera other than very slowly gives you unpleasant effects. ..especially on the 24p and 30p settings.

No charger other than the camera.  With my Panasonic PV-GS250 the little box between the power cord and the camcorder was the charger, unlike this Canon that uses the camera as the charger.  So, I could use the Panasonic with one battery and charge another battery at the same time.  With this Canon, you are forced to buy a separate charger to do that.

No neck strap.  C'mon Canon.  Pfffrrrt.

For still photography, you can shoot lower quality pics while videotaping, but if you want to snap higher quality pics while not videotaping, then you have to slide a switch before you can start snapping pics.   Then slide it back when you plan to shoot video. Why?  This is annoying and makes no sense!  With my Panasonic, you can snap pics anytime.  The camera can detect automatically whether or not you are shooting video.

Also, for still pics, you need a "MiniSD" card.  This is one of the hardest and rarest cards to find.  Then when you find it, it likely won't be on special.  I went to 4 top electronics stores trying to find one, and only 1 store had something I could use.  It was a "MicroSD" card that comes with a MiniSD adapter.  So, of course I had to pay more.  All other cards had some sort of special discount happening except this one.  You might have more luck ordering one online from somewhere.  But really, Canon should have just used a regular SD card slot for this video camera.  The MiniSD is only a few millimetres smaller.

This camera is not very ergonomic.   It is hard to hold it and stay comfortable in your hand.  

The viewfinder is not adjustable and has no rubber eye guard.

It has a built in light, which is great, but it is cool blue and that just doesn't make things appear warm and natural on screen.

I don't think you can get video footage onto your computer without a Firewire cable (not provided with camera).   Not really an issue except that Apple seems to be phasing out the Firewire port and not every PC has them either. 

The built in mics are at the front of the camera, but they are on top facing up.  My old Panasonic SD camera has the mics in front, but below the lens and facing forward.  It seems to produce better sound that way than the Canon, but the Canon has decent sound.

I have owned 4 electric nose hair trimmers over the years.  One came from a company that proclaimed it to be the best.  Another came from The Sharper Image - they also raved about their piece of junk.  Another, my most recent, was a Conair - another cheaply made device that died very early in its brief career.  

A bit over a week ago, I found myself searching for another unit on Amazon.  I had hopes that perhaps a company had finally designed a unit that actually worked for more than a few weeks.  I came across this beauty which was relatively inexpensive with an offer of free shipping.  I ordered it, it arrived quickly, and I am quite impressed with the unit.  It works as advertised, and has the look, heft and feel of a precision instrument.  I did not realize it when I purchased the unit, but it comes with a lifetime guarantee.

The TX1 is an upgrade to my 4mp Pentax MX4 that also has a 10x zoom but with no image stabilization and shot 640x480 30fps MPEG4 video. It is even smaller than the MX4 with much better 1280x720 30fps video that can be used at 10x handheld with no shakes compared to the MX4 that needed a tripod at 10x . It's the perfect pocket camera for still and video use. I use an Epson P-2000 40gb multimedia viewer/storage device to unload my 2gb SD cards and have a Kingston 8gb class 6 SDHC card on order. I use my Pentax DSLR with a myriad of lenses if I want to do creative stills but the TX1 will be used for most vacation shots of the kids etc.

The FURminator is a winner. Using a GENTLE touch you can easily gather and dispose of excess dog hair. It may seem like lots of money but it's worth it compared with alternative techniques.

A rubberband would be a good idea as the plastic doesn't stay in place on it's own. Go Fur it !

I am really very pleased with this excellent laptop.  We have been in the market for one for some time now, and this suits the bill admirably.  It is loaded with all the latest & greatest stuff you could wish for in a laptop \ desktop replacement, and has a slick silver & black mirror - like exterior:

?4GB of RAM!  This will handle almost any desktop related tasks you care to throw at it.
?64-bit Vista - needed to recognize the amount of memory over 3 GB.  I have had no problems so far with 64-bit Vista using a number of different peripherals (I was expecting issues).
?DVD burner with Lightscribe - allows you to mark the CD with etched labels, etc.
?Touchpad - I am not partial to touchpads since my thumb always brushes them while typing.  This unit comes with a handy switch to 'turn off' the touchpad.
?Bluetooth enabled.
?Credit card sized remote control (for media & AV components), which slips very cleverly into the media slot on the left side corner.
?14.1" screen (358.14MM) LCD screen that is very bright and sharp, and equipped with an internal web-camera.
?HDMI output - so you can play hi-def video on your HDMI capable media center.
?TV antenna input.
?Norton Anti-virus
?Dual headphone jacks, conveniently located in the front right corner.
?Easily accessible media player controls above the keyboard.
?Simple Wireless on/off switch on the case

One complaint I have about the engineering is that the power supply cord plugs in on the right side of the unit, and not the back.  This crowds the right side of the laptop.  When using the USB ports on the same side, they can get entangled with the DVD player when it opens and closes.  This is a minor annoyance, but I thought it deserved a mention.

What I like most about the book is that when you read what he is saying and apply it to your current relationship, it lets you know how your man is and what is going through his head about you. Sometimes we as women always want to be reassured that our man is connected and still in love. This book allows us to see that while he may not always purchase flowers but the love he shows is by paying the bills and fixing things around the house. It just made me smile when I looked back in hindsight at some of the things that my man had to deal with and I love reading in black and white from another man that he does indeed think I am a KEEPER...:-)

Nothing lasts forever, and my old Sonicare that I had for over seven years finally wore out (the batteries would no longer take a charge).  I've been a big fan of Sonicare for years, so had no doubts about buying a new one... the e5500 is much improved over my old one... it is much easier to keep clean and the thin neck enables you to keep your mouth closed during brushing so the toothpaste doesn't dribble down your chin.  The Quad-Pace feature is great for helping me ensure that all my teeth get proper time with the toothbrush.  I feel very strongly that if you follow the instructions, you will have cleaner, whiter, healthier teeth than just using an old manual toothbrush.

After this season's finale, I went back and became engrossed in season 1 again. The differences between the 2 seasons are minute, but I have to say that the production team really stepped up the historical accuracies of the show (after numerous issues with season 1). The attention to detail is shown with marvelous care with the beheadings of Bishop John Fisher and Sir Thomas More (Jeremy Northam will be sorely missed!), utilizing their heartbreaking and brave final speeches almost verbatim. The acting for season 2 shows a finely glossed maturity for each of the principal characters, but yet you feel a raw pain at what will ultimately be the end of the love affair between Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. 

JRM's take on Henry VIII is downright frightening this season. Where the viewer saw a somewhat unaware king in season 1, this Henry is all-powerful, all-knowing, and most importantly, UNchecked by anyone. The moody king, the happy king, the fierce pride, it's all there. This characterization of Bluff King Hal is a brave one-there is not a time when the viewer isn't saying, "This king is one crazy SOB," but he is still absolutely RIVETING. The beautiful final scenes of the swan being killed and Henry enjoying swan pie, is full of symbolism (remember, swans mate for life). I had goosebumps watching it the entire time.

Natalie Dormer (in my humble opinion) is THE standard for which all other Anne Boleyn's will be measured from this day forward. Forget Genevieve Bujold's portrayal in "Anne of the Thousand Days;" Dormer's take shows the fragility, self-awareness, and intelligence of England's most controversial Queen consort. Her self-assurance and cockiness in episodes 1-4, her paranoia and manic behavior in episodes 5-9, and finally, the penultimate, episode 10, her quiet determination to die a dignified death, is breathtaking to watch. A positively magnificent performance! 

I'm almost too emotional to consider what happens in season 3. How can anyone top Dormer and Rhys Meyers's chemistry (I'm not expecting much from "plain" Jane Seymour-although Anita Briem has been replaced-or Joss Stone as Anne of Cleves)? The series lost a great spark in Natalie Dormer, but, alas, the show must go on. 

4.5 stars (although, once again, the DVD release is sorely lacking in extras)!

I'll start off by saying that I've had a little bit of trouble with this router. The set-up wizard did not work properly, which annoyed me, so I had to perform the manual set-up using the instructions on Linksys's site. Within 10 minutes of the thankfully easy set-up, I had my BellSouth 3-meg connection shared with my PC, Wii, and DS. I had a difficult time getting it to work with some of my PC games, though, as I had to spend quite a while tinkering around with my router and modem's settings to get StarCraft running on the thing. However, after a while, I got everything working properly, and I have to say that this router was money well spent. I primarily bought it as a replacement for my Nintendo Wi-Fi USB connector, and in this respect it functions perfectly. I get excellent signal strength from anywhere in my house, a necessity considering the fact that my Wii and router are about as far away from each other as possible. Anyway, everything works well. The wireless is very good and fast, and it's easy to set up.

Look: 8/10: The blue and black design looks good, but clashes a bit with my silver and black computer, but that's hardly a big complaint.

Set-Up: ?/10: If you're just going to use this with game consoles, it's a 10/10, as the manual set-up is easy to understand. If you're setting it up to work with PC games, it depends on which modem you're using (my Westell 6100 doesn't play well with others) and what games you're playing (Guild Wars worked fine for me without the set-up that Starcraft required).

Functionality: 10/10: The router is fast and the signal strength is very good. Overall, this is an excellent product.

Unit arrived as promised and it looked great. I had hoped to use it on a granite counter top until installation in a sailboat but Black&Decker customer service states it must have four inches clearance all the way around, from any other surface. So, it is sadly being returned. Sadly, because it looks as good as the pictures indicate and it would fit my needs exactly. I remain puzzled however as to why B&D designed it with 3/4" feet at each corner if its only real use is under counter? I assummed from the pics that if it had feet I could use it on the counter top. Well, you know what they say about assuming...lol. (Lost $13.85 in shipping)

I was first given these diapers at my baby shower and my friend said "Your going to love these!"  Boy was she right.  The diapers have never broke out my daughter's sensitive skin and the blanket-feel make sures there are no leaks and messes.  I tried another brand one time when the store ran out of Pampers and never again.  They just didn't feel right and were bulky on her.  Plus you can't beat this price with a baseball bat.  The cheapest that I have found is $17.47 for 88 diapers and here you get 218 for $36 bucks! Also my local stores do not carry any size past one; at Amazon I found all of the sizes for the same great price.  Needless to say I am a fan!!  My friend is pregnant and lives out of the country; when I visit her I am definetly taken a box with me.  Only complaint I have is that they should make them in more designs; Sesame street is getting old.

I have to say that I was skeptical that I really needed a food processor, but I bought this one last year and love it.  It's a snap to clean, it chops with near-effortlessness and it's simple to use.  It takes up a bit of counter space, but it's worth it.I have made fabulous pesto sauces, olive tapenade, and just used it to chop garlic.  It works equally well for all of them.In fact, I have not a single complaint about this item. ....

These diapers are great, they are of the same quality as Pampers, only about $6-7 cheaper for the same amount.  They have the stretchy sides that are exactly the same type as Pampers Swaddlers and Cruisers.  They have a babypowder scent to them, which is a little stronger than the Swaddlers, but not to where it bothers anyone.  So far I've tried Target, Wal-Mart brands, Huggies, Pampers and Luvs.  From my experience they ALL leak, no matter what they say.  Especially when my breastfed baby has an explosive poop while not laying on his back -- this makes the liquid come out from the back of the diaper.  But these don't leak as much as Huggies and generic brands.  They are also not as rough as Huggies.  Like I said, I would compare these to Pampers, I really think they stole their design ;)

I was given the original black version of this product as a gift. It worked well for several years. However, the user interface was the worst I've ever seen! Until a kind soul posted the "cheat sheet" review here, I had to scrounge up the documentation every time I wanted to change a setting --and I'm an expert at navigating embedded-device interfaces (in fact I design them for a living). 

Recently it stopped dispensing properly, and I decided to buy a new one. After looking  at other options, I decided to buy another one of these. Fortunately I picked the white version this time; not only does it look nicer, but the interface has been completely redesigned. It still has the three buttons on the side, but they're used in a far more logical and intuitive manner now. It's still not perfect, but it no longer takes a PhD in puzzle-solving just to navigate the menus!

My one caveat here, and the reason I'm only giving it four stars, is that it turned out to have the same problem that my original unit was having: it's very finicky about the batteries used... 

My problems with the original unit started when the original batteries, which lasted several years, finally died. Initially, rather than lighting the low-battery light, it simply locked up completely whenever it tried to engage the dispenser motor. It would happily let me set up the feeding times and then keep time right up until the first feeding time ...at which point the clock would stop and nothing else would happen. Then I'd have to turn the power off and back on in order to reboot the user interface.

Once I realized that the batteries were the problem, I replaced them with unused ones I had on hand. But almost immediately it started doing the same thing again. Since the batteries were "new", I assumed that the unit was dead and ordered a replacement (the white version). 

But when I put batteries into new unit, it did exactly the same thing! Fortunately the white version has an external power input (4.5V DC, 1A), and I just happened to have a roughly-compatible charger from another device, so I was able to verify that it would work on AC power. After some more experimenting, I finally found a set batteries it was "happy" with --all from the same batch, mind you, so there's no reason why one should work while another doesn't. So far it's working fine with these new batteries, but I'm keeping an eye on it just in case. 

(One more word of warning: if you have an AC adapter plugged in, sometimes the interface locks up immediately when you unplug it or lose power, even if you have batteries in it. Of course my AC adapter isn't a perfect voltage match, so that could be the cause.)

I have a feeling I know what happened to the users seeing leaking problems. Could be two reasons - missing seal basket or it's due to a small hose inside the unit that can pop off the pump. The seal basket can be ordered through a local supplier, just takes a set screw to put in but make sure the unit is off and cold to the touch, otherwise you will sticking your hand into a very hot area(took me around 15 seconds to reinstall the seal). The hose issue isn't very hard to fix either. To fix you unplug the machine, take the screws off the back panel and pop it off pulling from the sides and top then pulling it up off the base, then you will probably see a small hose detached and you just plug it right back in to the top of the pump in the lower portion of the machine. It's that simple. For the users that saw and explosion type problem, probably due to overtamping while using the pressurized portafilter...bad idea. Either that or they're incredibly unlucky, the chances of a pressure explosion are slim to none unless you are doing something terribly wrong. So overall I think the machine works great, especially if you remove the black pressurizer from the portafilter and also buy a new basket - this mod converts it to a non pressurized portafilter that creates a superior shot. Just my $.02.

i think this is a great fountain, My cat loves it, she also loves to play in it, but thats another story. I read some complaints on there before I purchased my drinkwell. Some people complained about noise, but truth be told, as long as its not running low on water, the only noise you hears is of the water flowing. If you don't like that, just turn the speed down, and don't over fill it, and its quiet as can be.

Every cat owner knows their pet(s) must drink plenty of water for good health. Fresh water is as necessary to your cat's well being as good, nutritious cat food. My two certainly drink lots of water - especially in hot weather. However, stagnate water in bowls loses its freshness fast. It also accumulates cat hairs, dust and debris - not very appetizing. Drinkwell Pet Fountain for Cats encourages pets to drink all the water they need because there's always a supply of clean flowing water. Re-circulating water, with greater exposure to oxygen, provides fresh-tasting, cool, filtered water with lots of health benefits. Encouraging cats to drink more water helps ensure proper kidney function and may decrease the incidence of urinary disease.

The charcoal filter, which is a feature I really like, absorbs bad tastes and odors. The fountain has a six cup capacity, and you can purchase an additional six cup capacity with use of a refill accessory. The additional water supply is wonderful, especially if you go away for the weekend frequently.

The weather has been really warm, recently, in my neck of the woods. I bought my Drinkwell Fountain at the end of April and my cats, Dapple and Max, love it. I still change the water every two days or so, wash the water dish, and I check the water level daily - but that's me. Also, be sure to remove any pet hair that has accumulated near the intake propeller every few days. When the water level is kept above the intake valve, there is no noise except the soothing sound of flowing water.

The cats are also fascinated by the running water, and just hanging out by the water fountain encourages them to drink more. Who knows what they gossip about.

I was not a tea drinker. For some reason, drinking hot beverages never appealed to me. I know the green tea is full of antioxidants so I thought it would be great to drink the tea cold, as in ice tea. I have not drunk ice tea more than three times in my life.  Because of this fast, convenient ice tea maker, I'm drinker 6 cups of ice green tea a day!  I like how easy it is to use and that the tea is iced and ready in less than 10 minutes!  It is easy to clean and store as well.  I recommend this ice tea maker to anyone. And I encourage everyone to get away from soda and drink more ice tea! After using this machine, I am sure you will!

If you've read this novel, you know the inexplicable pain that tore through your very core as you watched Bella suffer those long, long, almost unbearably long months away from Edward. If my best friend, the one who exposed me to the series, hadn't already "spoiled" the ending for me and told that he came back to her, I'm not sure I'd be alive to write this review. The writing, again, was fantastic. And the imagery, divine. Stephenie, if I may call you that, I love and admire you so much for you unparallel skill at writing, but at the same time can't stand you for the same reason. What chance to any of us other writers, aspiring or otherwise, stand when these are the competition? You know what, I'd rather none of my works ever published than lose this series, even a single chapter or page. I felt like I was going to die as I read New Moon, but not for anything would I have torn myself away. Thank you once again, you are the best example we readers/writers have of a master wordsmith and creative genius.

The hard drive has been working great as of January 19,2008.  I tend to use it every week or so(or when I have a chance), and each session the transfer time of 3.5+ Gigabytes usually takes me at least 6 to 8 minutes(not bad considering I used a network 1 TB drive that took 25+- minutes to transfer 3.5 gigabytes of video!!)  

I have NOT run into one single problem; the hard drive, as stated before, works fast and is just as loud as my laptop fan during data transfer (not loud, a low "hum").  
I give this hard drive an extra positive mark for HAVING an ON/off switch. This added option is important to me because sometimes I just want to use my hard drive for 10 minutes before disconnecting it and turning it off. Some hard drives turn on automatically once connected to the USB and you run the risk of corrupting it if you unplug the USB unsafely.

This review is from: Religulous [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)

      



I'm reminded of a pivotal scene in "Inherit the Wind," when Henry Drummond and Matthew Harrison Brady debate each other over Bertram Cates, on trail for teaching his students Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. "Do you think a sponge thinks?" Drummond asks. "If the Lord wishes a sponge to think," replies Brady, "it thinks." Then Drummond gets to the heart of the matter: "Does a man have the same privilege as a sponge?" Brady says, "Of course!" in frustration. "Then this man," proclaims Drummond, pointing at Cates, "wishes to have the same privilege of a sponge! He wishes to think!" What's interesting is that a sponge absorbs whatever it comes in contact with, remaining inside until a firm hand forcefully squeezes out the contents. The obvious analogy is that we are like sponges, and religion is one of the many things we tend to absorb. Bill Maher, a smart, witty, controversial man, is the hand that wants to squeeze religion out of us.

He makes his point abundantly clear in the Larry Charles documentary "Religulous," a made up word that combines "religious" and "ridiculous." Organized religion, according to Maher, is a neurological disorder. You may agree with this, or you may not. All I can say is that this movie represents his opinion; it is not out to tell you what you should or shouldn't believe. That being said, it's silly to think that all audiences will respond to this film. If you're a person of faith, then Maher will essentially be making fun of you all throughout. He also interviews numerous people practicing the three major religions (Christianity, Judaism, and Islam), and he spends most of the time talking over their opinions in an attempt to refute them. On the other hand, he continuously asks what I feel are very intelligent questions. If God is all-powerful, why doesn't He just vanquish the Devil? How can He be a jealous God if He's also a loving God? If Christianity is a monotheistic religion, why does it refer to a number of divine beings, such as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit?

One of the few intelligent answers Maher got related to that last question, and it struck him just as much as it struck me. It came from an actor who portrays Jesus at the Holy Land Experience theme park in Orlando, Florida. Never mind the fact that such a theme park exists, and never mind that they show reenactments of Jesus' bloody crucifixion on a daily basis (to throngs of cheering tourists, I might add); the actor that works there still poses an interesting idea. The Holy Trinity, he says, is a lot like the solid, liquid, and gas phases of water--they take on different forms, yet they're made up of the same stuff.

Are religion and faith made up of the same stuff? Is it possible to believe in the spiritual but not the religious? Can one be open to the idea of a universal source while rejecting the idea of God? I often wonder what position Maher takes; despite the fact that he despises organized religion, his views on the existence of some divine force remain unclear. He considers himself an Apatheist, someone who believes that God has absolutely no bearing on how we live our lives, even if He does exist. I guess it doesn't matter what he believes. The fact that he admits to not knowing one way or the other proves that he's actually thinking, which, as Henry Drummond would assert, we all have the right to do.

This doesn't say much for the people Maher interviews around the world, most of whom are so steadfast in their faith and yet completely at a loss to explain themselves. One such person is a reformed gay minister from Florida, now married to a reformed lesbian and has three children. Another is Jeremiah Cummings, formerly a member of Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes and now a very rich minister. Was it not Jesus who preached that it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter Heaven? Another is an ex-Jew for Jesus who converted to Christianity when he experienced a "miracle." And then there's Jose Luis de Jesus Miranda, who actually believes that he's the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, descended from a bloodline that traveled from the Holy Land through Europe before ending up in Puerto Rico. As of now, he has over 100,000 followers. I'll never be one of them, although he is oddly charming.

Larry Charles humorously spices up each interview with a series of inter-cut video clips and subtitles, all of which play into Maher's verbally mischievous tendencies. It's one-sided, but it's also incredibly funny. At least, I think it's funny. But that's easy for me to say; Maher and I can agree that Biblical fables, such as Adam and Eve, Noah's Ark, and Jonah and the Whale (excuse me--Jonah and the Great Fish) are so outlandish that they're impossible to believe in. Here's another quote from "Inherit the Wind": "The Bible is a book. It's a good book, but it is not the ONLY book." As for God, what I or Bill Maher or anyone else believes doesn't matter in the slightest. "Religulous" is not concerned with Him, anyway; it's more concerned with the people who do and say things in His name, not all of which serves humanity very well. This is a bitingly funny and at times highly thought-provoking documentary, questioning the faithful while at the same time questioning faith itself.

I bought this through the Canadian Home Shopping channel.  I got the 160gb unit.  It does exactly as it says.  I plugged it in and it backed up my desktop.  It took 5 hours for the first back up, then it only takes a few minutes for subsequent back ups.  I have never used a computer attachment that is so simple to use.  It is convenient and portable, it fits right in my pocket.

Great buy, I highly reccomend it.

I am a hiker and a daily walker and it is important to me to know how far I've hiked/walked as well as the number of aerobic steps in a given amount of time. Also I realize the importance of achieving at least 10,000 steps per day. This pedometer does it all plus much more.

For anyone who is a casual or serious walker I strongly recommend this Omron HJ-112 pedometer. The quality is excellent as is the accuracy. The price of this unit purchased through Amazon is very reasonable for such quality.

I thought it only fair to review the DIR-655 after giving the DIR-625 such a bad review.  I am not a network engineer or a computer engineer.  However, I am probably more technical than the average homeowner.  My biggest concerns are for range and reliability.  This prodcut is top notch for both.  I have not run any bandwidth/throughput tests, but surfing the internet seems fine.  I highly recommend this product.

This is a great netbook. I did a bunch of research before settling on the Samsung NC10. Unfortunately, it is difficult to test netbooks in the stores as most do not carry a wide selection. I had narrowed down my search to the Lenovo Ideapad S10 (tried at Circuit City), MSI Wind and the Samsung. The Lenovo got tossed out because it only came with a 3 cell battery. Other than that, it felt like a quality machine with good keyboard, screen and overall build quality. Decided to take a shot with the Samsung and have not been disappointed. This is a great computer. I upgraded the memory to 2 gigs of Crucial RAM. Very easy to do and added a little pep to the machine, which was already fast. The keyboard is great and feels as close to a full size keyboard as your going to get. The webcam works great using Skype. I was able to get used to the trackpad after a couple of days, so I would not let that stop you from buying. Also, the single mouse button rocker bar works fine. The battery is great averaging 6+ hours.

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)

      



The Dark Knight is really an overwhelming experience. For a two and a half hour movie, it really goes by fast. The film's plot is simple: While Harvey Dent, Commissioner Gordon, and Batman try to bring down the Mob, the Joker outsmarts them at every turn. The fight to stop the Joker becomes more than a fight to stop crime, however. The Joker attempts to bring out the worst in everybody, to prove that we are all as mad as him. He targets the people that everybody holds most dear: hospital patients, civilians, politicians, cops, and the woman Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent love, Rachel Dawes. Batman and Harvey Dent have to struggle to prove they are better men than the Joker.  Bruce Wayne has hope the Dent will be able to clean up the city, and plans on settling down with Rachel Dawes.  I felt this part of the plot was a little rushed and somewhat predictable.  Does every superhero have to try to give up being a superhero?  This is only a minor quibble though.

Heath Ledger gives an outstanding performance. He slips into the role like a glove, something Jack Nicholson really could not do because his personality was too strong. They utilized Ledger perfectly. He steals the show whenever he is on screen but it never feels like this is a Joker movie.  His "humor" is so sick I think audiences laugh only because they are uncomfortable. As many critics have noted, The Dark Knight works as a legitimate crime drama as well as a superhero movie. All of the Joker's schemes would fit right into a movie like Silence of the Lambs or Seven. They are so intense I was at the edge of my seat whenever he was on screen. I particularly liked his announcement to Gotham City that if a certain individual (can't recall his name) was not dead within 60 minutes, he would blow up a hospital. It was the perfect type of scheme for the Joker. With every scheme, explosion, and every person killed, the Joker pushes Batman to his limits.

The entire cast gives an all around good job. Aaron Eckhart gives a good performance as Harvey Dent. The combination of make-up and CGI for his face was perfect. Christian Bale was even more intense this time around, although his voice is sometimes grating. The scene where he interrogates the Joker is the most suspenseful scene in the movie. I should also note that the action scene editing was a major improvement over Batman Begins. Sometimes Nolan cuts a little too quickly but it is not as distracting this time.

I only have a few minor criticisms (Big time SPOILERS). I still do not like Christopher Nolan's Gotham City. I understand he went for the modern look to give it a more realistic, serious feel, but Gotham has never looked modern in the comics. I just think Gotham should have a distinctive look. Maggie Gyllenhall, while better than Katie Holmes, sometimes acted a little out of character for an assistant D.A. Finally, I think they should have saved Two-Face for the third movie. Killing him off in this movie made his story feel rushed. I can't really think of another Batman bad guy whose story can really compare to Harvey Dent's. They are going to have a tough time coming up with a bad guy for the third film. Nevertheless Harvey Dent's story arc is tragic and effective. Harvey Dent represented the hope and strength Gotham needed to overcome evil. He was written and portrayed a million times better than he was in Batman Forever. His fall from grace gives Joker the last laugh, and Batman has to cover up everything Two-Face did so as not to hurt Gotham's morale or release the prisoners Dent put in jail.

I look forward to seeing where they will take the Batman character in the next movie. The Dark Knight stands towards the top of the list of best Superhero movies for its perfect portrayal of the characters and all around intensity.

I was very pleased with the timely delivery.  I was even more impressed with the design.  I was able to put the mounting plat on the center board of the desk in the vertical position next to my printer.  I'm now able to put my keyboard, printer, and web-cam in the back ports.  That leaves me one port in the back of the hub and 2 in the back of my PC as well as 3 to utilize with ease in the front of the hub.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.

Okay, for all you readers out there...just a little education on young-adult novels. First, the recommended age for the reader is the age of the hero/heroine in the novel. So...in Breaking Dawn, Bella is 18 about to turn 19. Do the math. Don't have your tweens reading this one without you reading it first!!! As a mom myself, this is a no-brainer!!

Second, Stephenie Meyer has followed a well-designed plot, and has left us with a four-volume work WITHOUT any literary gaps. For those of you who don't know what that entails, literary gaps are "holes" in the story and loose ends that aren't wrapped up that are vital to the plot.

Third and last. Reading is for enjoyment. I sure as hell enjoyed these novels. Beats the sappy romance crap that others read, and gave me the mental stimulation (stay with me here) to allow myself to escape into a plausible world where I did enjoy the ride. Thanks Steph.

My daughter has been watching infomercials again, and decided we had to have a juicer.  I priced them for a month, and you can go very, very high--unless you are me.  I bought the Hamilton Beach thinking this would be a fad that we would enjoy, and then we'd move on to the Latke Lathe or some other gadget.  I only give this four stars because I just got it, so I can't vouch for longevity, but the juice was very good, the machine was easy to operate and easily cleaned.  I put it through it's paces, too, pulverizing everything I could get my hands on in the produce aisle.

Played FIFA 2005 using the brand new controller. Works great! First I installed the driver and software as instructed by the manual. Everything was fine. Then a week later, I removed the batteries. When I replaced the batteries, the calibration of the analog sticks were off. And there's no way to re-calibrate using the driver installed. So, I decided to uninstall the driver and software. Then, I used Windows XP's control panel to calibrate the gamepad. It works fine after that. So, if you get this gamepad, you don't need to install the drivers and software if you're using Windows XP. As for other Windows versions, you'l have to try to find out. The software is just an interface for you to assign buttons for various games that you have. Some games already allow you to reconfigure the buttons in the game's options.

Overall, great gamepad and range is pretty good too.

It is wonderful to see this movie in digital format- the picture is amazingly clear, and the sound is even better.  Since this movie is so old, the sound is lower than most movies, but in DVD format comes across very clear.  The scenery is also well suited for the DVD format, and scenes such as the wounded in Atlanta are truly brought to new light.I do think it is interesting that they still leave in the intermission on these old movies.  I realize they are part of the film, but it is still kind of funny.  At least with the DVD version, you can easily skip this.  On the video version (at least the older ones), it is at the first part of the second tape- not a good idea.This is definitely an essential DVD!

This is a really nice hair dryer for the price.  It is powerful and much more quite than I thought it would be.  It dries my short, but thick hair quickly and the cold shot button really works.  It also dries much faster then my old Revlon hair dryer and makes my hair nice and shiny.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is because it is a little on the heavy side and I wish the cord was retractable.

I have had this coffee maker for years.  I drink a ridiculous amount of coffee and I'm very picky about it.  This maker brews great tasting coffee.  I do use good freshly ground beans and I immediately pour it into a carafe to stay hot but I always get comments on how fantastic my coffee is - even from people who buy the same coffee beans.  It also is one of the better looking machines and is not overly bulky.

Compared to other enclosures this is an excellent item. I chose to give it four stars because like all the others the case is not ventilated, no fan option, no auto shut-off. Someday there may appear an enclosure that deals with the heat build up. The problem seems to be that when you shut off your computer the drive in the enclosure continues to run and gets very hot; which concerns me about the effect upon the hard drive. There is a shut off switch on the item if you remember to use it. Otherwise this is as good as it gets for any enclosure that I have found. Presently I used three different makes and models of enclosures and this is definitely the best looking and doesn't lack in performance. I am well pleased with this purchase.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)

      



I got my husband a Flip video before we went on vacation so he could use it at his family reunion. It worked out wonderfully. I wish I would have had this. First, it doesn't use batteries which are a pain in the butt to keep track of. The little USB connector is mounted on a rubber extender that plugs right into my laptop. Because the extender is flexible (unlike the Flip) it's easier to snug in next to anything else I have plugged in. When I travel, I usually take a wireless mouse with me along with a portable hard drive. Being my laptop has only 4 usb ports, space is at a premium, so a flexible connector is MUCH appreciated.

Second, this is a bit smaller than the Flip. This fits easily in the zippered compartment of my purse. It also makes much better videos than my phone does, so I have taken to carrying it with me. It just 'feels' more solid than the Flip. Having a flash based camera is also a wonder because I am not worried about knocking it around. Hard drive based music players I have tend to react badly to stress. This little camera is rock solid. In the future I am going to stick with flash based devices because they have no moving parts, last longer and are ultimately lighter than heavy tape based camcorders or drive based mp3 players. They are also easier to recharge. The small videos these make (the Vado uses XViD to compress) are easily manipulated with basic software, and look good on even a large HD television. It's also very easy to put together a compilation with software like Nero, then burn it to DVD. If you have ever done the family reunion thing, you know that everyone wants copies of everything. Being able to assemble and burn something on the spot saves a lot in postage :p

I detected no reasonable difference between the Vado and the Flip as far as quality goes. Both contain features on the drive that enable you to upload videos to sharing services, like YouTube. The Vado drive contains a program you can use on your computer to view or upload your videos. It also has a self installing XViD codec which was very convenient. The Zoom is easier to use on the Vado. It also does very well in low light conditions which I found surprising. I bought the Flip because of brand recognition. If I had known about the Vado I would have certainly purchased that first. As it is, this is now MY camera :) My husband can keep the other thing :)

As small hard disks go this one is pretty much top of the line. I also considered getting the Western Digital passport 160 gb but just fell for the looks on this one and nothing else. The glowing orange drive was like a beacon and this one did pretty much the same things that the western digital did and more. I am presently not using Ceedo too actively so really cannot highlight the benefits of that but in the world of big and small this drive delivers the two contrasts equally well. Firstly the small form factor really makes it convenient to carry this with you wherever you wanna go. I have an ultra portable (Dell D410) and a Maxtor 500 GB external hard drive that I used both for my laptop as well as desktop but it was a pain to carry. The hard drive weighed twice as much as my laptop so really a needed a fix for this. I started looking around and both the WD Passport and the Maxtor 160 GB caught my eye. As I was researching these this one was announced and I decided to wait for it, I was a little surprised when on a trip to Singapore right after I saw these drives being sold there (A little more expensive than what Amazon sells these for) and after seeing a demo by the store representative I had to have it. I bought this on the spot even when the WD was a little cheaper as it was really classy to look at. My usual clutter and weight was immediately cut by 90%. The drive is not as fast as some of the reviewers pointed it to be but does fairly well when the amount of data to be copied is not a lot. If ur going to use this for business needs like I do I am pretty sure ur not going to be doing data transfers in access of 10GB at a time and for smaller data transfers this is perfect. Another thing that I like about this is the encryption, you can password protect the entire drive and keep almost anything on it that you don't like to be seen. I noticed that Ceedo works really well with some programs and with some others it's completely useless. After a few tries figuring the program out I let it be and realized that all I needed was a portable hard drive with a lot of space and I have got just that. The documentation around Ceedo and along with the drive could be much better like someone reported below. This is also a quite drive leaving out a very low hum you cannot hear the drive. If ur in the market for a large hard drive in terms of space but still a portable drive then this or the WD passport would be it.

This G25 is simply AMAZING. It receives 5 star votes for every category except value. This wheel's build quality is superb except the shifter like everyone has mentioned. This received a 4 star for value because come on.... $299msrp $220ish on every site? This is sooooo expensive. 

I upgraded from a Driving Force Pro,which I got for $70 so upgrading to something that was 3x as expensive took a long "sit on it" time. I have wanted this wheel since it was first introduced and then after 2 years of "sitting on it" I finally bought it. Driving racing sims with the clutch adds a whole new level of fun. The DFP was good, probably the best before the G25 came along. Too bad the DFP had plastic pedals that don't give you a lot of resistance, a force feed back motors that gives you a lot of noise. 

The G25 has amazing feel to it. The leather itself is worth some money in my book. Both the wheel and the gear shfiter are leather wrapped! The paddle shifters are aluminum that gives it a better feel than the DFP's buttons. When you shift with the g25 paddle shifter, it feels more smooth and sturdy. 

The best part about the G25 is the pedals. They have amazing quality and feel to it. The pedals are also aluminum so they definitely feels better. They have little balls on them just like real pedals in my car. The best part is, the difference in resistance among the three pedals sealed the deal for me. The Gas pedal is sort of loose, you can lightly stomp on it and make it go all the way to the ground. The clutch is heavier than the gas pedal but the length is the same. In my car, the clutch goes far down!!! The brake is the party piece!! It has such strong resistance that compared to the DFP, it is so much easier to control. Example: driving Laguna Seca in GTR2 approaching the corkscrew, in the DFP, I'd brake hard but I always have to pull my foot back so I don't lock up the wheels. In the G25, with the resistance, I just have to push down with a certain but firm force, then push down even further for that last little bit of braking power. 

I know a reviewer had said "clutch doesn't seem to do anything." Well in my games, the clutch does do something and it's important. 

In GTR2, you can enable the clutch but it'll still let you shift it into gears if you don't clutch in. The problem is when you're down shifting while in clutch mode. When you downshift without clutching in, you wheels are going to lock and make you spin out, probably not what you want on the Nurburing. Secondly, if you can heel-toe for downshifting, it makes the transition so much smoother. Also if you are not moving and in gear without clutching in(obvious for those of us who drive a manual), it's going to stall! Of course if you don't turn clutch mode on, the computer game would do that for you and then you might as well just buy a Driving force pro. 

In Test Drive Unlimited, clutching is absolutely essential. If you drive a manual in that game, and not clutch when you shift up or down, you're not going to get in gear then! Also if you don't work on your footwork you're going to stall the car when driving from a stop. For some unfortunate reason you spin out and don't clutch in, your car's going to stall too. This stuff makes it so fun for me!

Highly recommend this if you have $220ish to burn. (sell your GT4, sell your DFP, sell a couple of lemonades...)

Games I play: GTR2, Richard Burns Rally(with RSRBR08), Test Drive Unlimited, and Live For Speed. 

Pros: the feel is everything!!!! 
Leather wrapped wheel and shift knob
Brake and Clutch pedals resistance
Paddle shifters
900 degrees
PC compatible!!!! PS2 and PS3 too but I dont own them
Gear box can be a H-shifter with 6 speed + Reverse OR set it to sequential!!!! Up to you!!!

Cons:
Price - slightly more than what I could afford but I'm skipping lunches to afford this
Shifter is flimsy - Didn't go into this too much in the review but shifter isn't like a real car. You put very little effort in moving the shifter. Too much and you could break it. 

Honestly this is the best steering wheel I've ever played with. 
DFP is good, like climbing and winning king of the hill. But with the G25, it's like climbing a mountain! Yep, that much difference!

This review is from: Pinocchio (Disney Gold Classic Collection) (DVD)

      



A musical, magical, gorgeously animated movie, Pinocchio is one of the  first classic Disney films that began to &quot;brand&quot; the Disney image  of enchanting, vigorous family entertainment.  The characters, from kindly  Geppetto, to the intoxicating Jiminey Cricket, and Cleo, Figaro and all of  the &quot;baddies&quot;, are endlessly engaging.  Flawlessly executed, with  a well-constructed, and purposely manipulative screenplay, this movie is  one of those rare pieces of commercial art: moving and entertaining at the  same time, and genuinely, surprisingly alive and contemporary.  If you  remember this movie from your childhood, you know how compelling and  horrific some of these darkly imagined scenes can be for a child -- and if  you have children now who have never seen it, give them a treat they will  never forget, along with some lessons that are truer today than ever.  A  walk down Main Street/Fantasyland in the Disney Parks owes much to the cozy  cottages and imagined warmth in light, shadow and music that was first  realized for this perfect movie.  A delight.

my OWC FW800 drive broke (and was very loud anyway) so i started looking into a few replacement options. 

i picked up two of these 750GB drives in anticipation of future failure (planned on using one soley as a backup of a backup). 

having gotten used to the speed of FW800, it is difficult to tolerate these drives as they are FW400 (my iMac doesn't have the eSATA interface). 

the supplied FW cable is fairly short, so i have it set up adjacent my iMac and the drive noise is too much. whereas my iMac is silent, this just whirls and drives me crazy.

it does look very elegant in it's piano black casing with cool blue under light. if it was quiet, i would leave it running. i recently purchased a Seagate FW800 drive and use it as an active external drive because it is so much faster and (like other seagate drives i have purchased) it runs quiet! 

so i use these cool looking but whirling LaCie drives solely as back up: music, vids, pictures... and then turn them off.

Before a couple of weeks ago, I have seen Battlestar only on DVD. Let me tell you the experience is 3x as riveting and addictive than watching on TV with all the commercials and little SciFi channel banners.

Though I some of the mystical stuff goes over my head (I ain't good at solving puzzles), I still enjoy it. While the special effects are top notch, it is the intricacies and depth of the characters that keep it interesting. All of these characters, even the good ones, have human frailities and they all at some time let it get the best of them often to spectacular sometimes tragic results. It's gritty drama at its best, but in space. Writing and storyline is not as smart as last season, but it doesn't disappoint either.

I am very pleased with this monitor.  I like the feature of keeping track of both my husband and I up to 84 readings.  This automatic monitor is more accurate than the manual one we had.  Glad I bought it.  Price was much lower through Amazon than in the stores.

We have a small dog that cannot be let ouside, particularly in the winter, and have always resorted to the pads. We've used other brands but they were not as absorbent and were inconsistent in manufacture. The Hartz are much better and moisture proof. We haven't found any bettert for the money.

The Keurig B70 brews a cup of coffee as quickly as advertised, with virtually no mess and no clean up.  There are so many different flavors to choose, that I'll never get bored with my cup of coffee.  My wife especially likes the additional capability of brewing a cup of tea or hot chocolate with absolutely no residual coffee taste left behind.  This was the best purchase we made for ourselves this holiday season!

I have it for so many years I can't remember. It is STILL WORKING. Even the carafe has held up through a couple of hits that have broken others in my past. STILL HOT!!! I love it. Only complaint, when I first got it I found it hard to see how much water was going in it. The fill section is not see through and not very easy to see into either. But as long as you line up how many cups you put in on the carafe and remember that, it works GGRR8T!  I would give it 7 stars if I could.

We love this flip. It's cheap, easy to use, light, and has good built-in software for posting videos to Youtube. It also has a great microphone. It picks up sound from the person taking the video and everyone around it. The other thing that I like about it is that is uses 2 AA batteries.

I very much recommend the Breville Juice Fountain Elite, Model 800 JEXL to anyone who is a serious juicer or juices for health issues.  It is well built, heavy duty, does not heat up the juice, the pulp comes out dry, and very easy to clean.  The manual is well written, easy enough. I am also getting a very high juice to pulp ratio and have not experienced this before.

Over the years I have burned-up many low end juicers and wasn't satisfied with so called high end devices.  "I am very pleased with this juicer."

This review is from: The Wizard of Oz (DVD)

      



See it again for the first time -- introduce it to a child.  Oz is as magical today as when L. Frank Baum first told the tale.  Who does not want to go &quot;Over the Rainbow?&quot;The thrill of watching Dorothy fight to keep Toto, then running away just as a storm is brewing is drama that children can feel.  Discovering a magician who is able to &quot;see&quot; Dorothy's past, and remind her of Aunt Em's love for her is a message for all generations.  Although we know much more about the effects of tornadoes now than when we were  children through the child's eyes we can still find that we are caught up in the storm.  The swirling images that pass Dorothy's window as the house whirls and finally lands was filled with special effects were magical in 1939; they still are.  The magic of sharing that moment when Dorothy opens the door into a world of color still makes children shiver with enchantment.  I remember one night when my parents were out, and I sneaked into the living room.  I kept the volume on the black and white TV low so that no one would come for me.  It was nearly midnight when that door to OZ opened. I was keenly disappointed that Oz was not in color, I was sure that this moment would fill my world with color.  That is the wonder of childhood.A child will tremble at the Wicked Witch of the East, and be enthralled as Glenda, the good witch of the North, floats to the ground in an iridescent bubble.  Children are frequently called &quot;Munchkin&quot; and they are surprised to discover Munchkinland.It is so easy to forget that Judy Garland is acting because her big eyes, wide smile, innocence, and voice are Dorothy.  Jack Haley as the Tin Man, Bert Lahr's Cowardly Lion, and Ray Bolger, who is the scarecrow, has given a legacy to film and heritage that is a genuine treasure.  Margaret Hamilton, the Wicked Witch of the East, has terrified children for more than six decades, and continues to do so.There is no place like home.  5 stars.Victoria Tarrani

I purchased this when my son was 4 months old.  A few days before the purchase I began having panic attacks during the middle of the night because I was afraid my son was going to suffocate on his blanket.  I went to Babies R Us and found exactly what I was looking for.  I have an 18 pound 4 month old so the large is great for him.  He fits it perfectly and doesn't seem to mind.  Although I still have to give him his blanket to help him fall asleep, I can take it away once he's asleep.  Now I'm resting much better at night!  This would make a great shower gift because not many moms know about it.  I would have loved it someone gave this to me!

The second season of this exceptionally intelligent science fiction series about a fleet of spaceships in the aftermath of the devastation of their home colonies was released in two parts; this DVD set contains the first ten episodes of the second season. In their sophomore effort, the show's creators took some real risks, dividing the cast for the first several episodes and putting the lead, Edward James Olmos, effectively out of operation (after being shot by a Cylon operative disguised as a human being). This allowed the show to put more of a spotlight on some of the characters that had been less throughly developed during the first season, and also to shift them to some unusual circumstances. President of the Colonies (Mary McDonnell) has been put in the brig for working against the military's interests; Lt. Kara "Starbuck" Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) has been sent on a mission to the devastated world of Caprica to find a sacred artifact that may be necessary for finding the way back to earth, and meets up with the lost Helo (Tahmoh Penicott) and his love, the Cylon turncoat Sharon (Grace Park); and Col. Tigh (Michael Hogan) has assumed control of the Galactica after Commander Adama (Olmos) has been shot and institutes martial law on the fleet. These new circumstances allows some fine new work on deepening some of the characters that had seemed more thinly drawn in the previous season, particularly for McDonnell and Park. (Keep your eye also on the superb work done by Alessandro Juliani in the comparatively smaller role of Lt. Gaeta.) 

The show suffers a bit in  focus by having the characters so scattered in the early episodes. This separation has its payoff, however, when the characters reunite midway through the set, a genuinely affecting moment validates the comparisons many have elsewhere made of these contemporary densely plotted complex cable dramas to the nineteenth-century multiplot blockbuster novels of the Victorians. Unfortunately there is substantially less humor this season than previously, in part because the character of Dr. Baltar (the fine James Callis), although this also means we are spared too many of his previously interminable scenes with his fantasy of the dead Cylon Number Six (Tricia Helfer). There are notable guest appearances in this set by Lucy Lawless, who sadly is mired in the weakest and most unbelievable of the season's episodes, and Michelle Forbes, who is featured in one of the season's best shows as the self-righteous and ruthless commander of another battlestar discovered by the fleet. The show's special effects are absolutely first rate, and even allow for real moments of beauty which are often sadly and surprisngly lacking in science fiction series: there's a gorgeous long shot in the second episode of a thousand smaller raider ships glittering in sunlight against the darkness of space as they pour out of a Cylon base. I recommend dispensing with the sometimes informative but more often gaseous DVD commentaries by series developer Ronald D. Moore.

Excellent little netbook. Decent battery life (~3 hours at moderate use), and good enough resolution for the screen size. There are two physically separate drives: a 4Gb and an 8Gb. The smaller drive reads and writes noticeable faster, so if you plan to tinker, make sure to use that for OS and the larger drive for storage. I wiped XP Home as a precaution against everything I hate about computers, and put EEEBuntu on. Very easy to do, and now it runs without a problem. The video card is powerful enough to run full resolution presentations off of it without bogging the machine down. My only note is the keyboard size. Try one out before you buy it. I have smaller hands and after a day of typing I can touch type proficiently, but my Father has large bear paws and cannot use the keyboard at all.

I purchased this item so that I can "grill" on my terrace to replace a gas grill that, as a tenant, I am no longer able to use.  This item is the closest grill to actual barbecue.  The meats and grilled veggies came out terrific and the clean-up wasn't too tedious.  The unit is fairly large, but is very light weight (surprise), and can be stored easily.  The cooking surface is ample(does six burgers and a couple of hot dogs at once). I'm so happy we haven't had to give up out summer meals outside!

Eight years doing my taxes with TurboTax!  In 2007, we have changed jobs, moved to a different state, performed independent contract work, bought a house, sold a house, given to charities, doctor bills, all kinds of deductions and went active duty military.  Oh, and five kids also figure into the mix.

I looked at doing one of the states myself since my version of TT pays for one state return and quickly decided I needed to run it through TurboTax.  We had too much going on in 2007 for me to do it manually.

Yes, it walks you through every tax situation possible, with easy to understand explanations.  The format is easy on the eye and especially on the brain.

The best part, for me, of using TurboTax is finally being able to understand my tax situation.  It gives advice for future tax situations and the benefits or consequences of your financial actions. 

I am so sold on TurboTax and the support that goes behind it, I became a TurboTax beta tester a few years back.

I have three cats that LOVE water.  On average, our cats play in the bathtub, with the water running, 5-10 times per day, for about 5-10 minutes.  They used to drink out of the sink, but then one day they realized that they could have so much more fun in the tub!  They cover their face and paws in water...   I could write a thesis detailing their strange obsession with water; it's quite bizarre.  They wake us up each morning for water (grrr).  Water is healthy for them, so I'd hate to deny them something enjoyable and healthy, but it gets old after a while.  I bought this machine so hopefully they would forget about the sink & tub, but no such luck.  We see them drink out of the fountain occasionally, but they still prefer playing in the tub (sighs).  I have the biggest reserve, so the fountain holds about a gallon of water, and it's wonderful to know that when I'm gone, they always have a source of water.  My cats love the wheat grass, but buy it separately; it makes a mess in the fountain!  Yuck!  Also, use purified water; you will love yourself come cleaning time!  Product is great though, so I highly recommend!

Let me start by saying that if you are looking for blu-ray quality HD from any of the HD pocket cams currently available on the market... this includes the Mino HD, Kodak Zi6, or Vado HD, it just is not going to happen. The Vado HD looks great for its size, price, features, and best of all ease of use and fun factor!
 
Being able to keep a Vado HD pocket cam capable of recording four hours of high definition video at 1280x720 (720P), literally in your pocket is quite amazing. The Vado HD can store up to four hours of HD video or 8 hours of VGA video internally on its 8 GB of storage. Battery life is rated at 2 hours; both of these specs are twice as high as the Mino HD. As you carry this wonderful device along with you, you start to look at all the little things in the world you sometimes miss. All of a sudden you want to record these events to show to the world. 

As I looked at video samples for the Mino HD, they seemed to be washed out compared to the vibrant color from the Vado HD. When you combine that with the fact that the Mino HD has less storage and battery life, there is just no question that Vado HD is a better buy. I have shot a couple of sample videos and uploaded them to youtube.com. So far I have been very happy with the Vado HD. I have not noticed any issues to be concerned about. The 720P looks great with viewed on your PC or on youtube. However, when you see it full size on an HDTV... you can tell the details are just not there like you would get with professional HD equipment. This is perfectly fine, for the quality you do get, the amazing convenience factor more than makes up for it. The software that the Vado HD comes with is streamlined and easy to use. It might be too basic for intermediate users though. I was able to import the videos just fine into Pinnacle Studio 12 Ultimate to add effects, filters, and transitions to the videos.  Here is one of my sample videos; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2-EkUo0WrQ

Here are some of my pro's and con's for the Vado HD...

Pro's:
-Double the storage space & battery life of other pocket HD cams
-Controls & button Layout easy to use
-Larger 2" LCD helps to frame 16x9 shots
-Low light performance was good with little noise
-Battery is exchangeable for increased recording time on the go
-1080i HDMI direct to TV output

Con's:

-Built in usb flexi-arm feels fragile & rubber pull tab interferes with certain tripod mounts
-Digital 2X Zoom not very impressive
-No macro mode for very close shots
-It could stand to be a little heavier and sturdier feeling

Overall I would recommend the Vado HD over the Kodak Zi6 and Mino HD. The Vado HD is just a better deal for your money at the moment. The con's I mentioned are true for a lot of the current pocket cams. The Vado HD is an excellent little pocket cam to take with you on all your daily adventures. I give it 4 out of 5 stars!

Enjoy!

These work wonders on long, frizzy hair. They also work well to just polish/shine naturally straight hair. 
Had to buy a replacement though... Went on a cruise and when we got on the ship, we realized that it had been broken somewhere during the trip. Rough baggage handlers are suspected. What broke was the ON/OFF switch... It wouldn't stay on anymore.
I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality straightener... just pack it in your carry on bag though when traveling!

This is a very good hand held mixer. As is with most KitchenAid products this unit performs extremely well.

I was given a USB flash drive from my company earlier this year. It was a generic 128-megabyte drive with my company's logo on it. It was an admirable performer considering it was probably a bottom of the line drive.

In more recent months I began to outgrow my generic drive. I run several programs directly from my drive including: a web browser, email client, and instant messaging program. I decided to purchase a new flash drive hoping for something with a larger capacity and possibly faster read/write time.

The SanDisk Cruzer Micro has so far met my expectations. It was already formatted right out of the box, which was nice. It came with a neck strap that attaches to the drive with a small ring (like the one you use your for your keys). I found it mildly annoying attaching it due to its small size. The strap itself is not exactly fashionable and I don't really have any need to walk around with the drive around my neck, although I do find myself doing that just because it's there. The part of the drive where it connects to the strap glows green when the unit is active. It was cool for about a whole minute when I first connected it but has since become ordinary.

It comes with three "skins" which are plastic coverings in clear, red, and blue. Personally I don't see much need for three of them but if you want to accessorize then be my guest. I walked out into the rain with the drive around my neck. The covering looked secure enough where I didn't feel the rain would really pose a threat. After more than a few raindrops on the device it seems to be perfectly fine.

There are some included programs on the drive which got me kind of excited. One called CruzerSync was only a 30 day trial so I didn't even bother with it. Another one called Cruzer PocketCache was also just an evaluation version which turned me off. The last program was called CruzerLock. This one was not a trial but a feature-reduced version. However it was completely functional. This program allows you to encrypt files on your drive that can only be accessed via the CruzerLock software with a username and password. It's simple and easy to use, no frills, and gets the job done. I normally don't worry about protecting my data but the software was simple enough where I thought, "why not?"

Performance wise the Cruzer Micro was superior to my generic drive (which is not really a surprise). I was hoping for even better performance but I can't complain. My Firefox web browser loads up in about 5 seconds when run from the drive and browsing works just as well off my flash drive as it would from my hard disk. Small document files around a few megabytes transfer very quickly.

So overall I am going to give the SanDisk Cruzer Micro a nod of approval. I would have liked it if they included only full versions of their software on the drive. But as far as the device itself goes, I cannot give it any low marks. You can buy this device and not worry about your purchase.

CH certainly does not disappoint. This is yet another amazing product of good quality and precision. I use it primarily to play Falcon 4.0: Allied Force. The only thing I would suggest to make this throttle control better would be to simply make it heavier. If you give it a good shove forward or back, it will slide a bit. I've had it for awhile and it has held up perfectly. No problems what so ever. All things considered, I have to give it 5 stars.

After spending much time looking at online reviews (including Amazon) comparing the Keurig models to other "single cup" machines, I made the decision to purchase this model.

Yes, it has two cup sizes. Yes, it has auto shut off (after 2 hours). 

An amazing machine that I'm extremely happy I purchased. It takes up little counter space. Brews a quick cup of coffee (or tea or hot chocolate). And, depending on what type of pods you use, brews quite the good cup of coffee. 

I found that the button for the "larger" size adequately fills a normal-sized mug. For my travel mug, I have to use two pods or brew twice through the first pod (which is not a huge deal if you use extra bold coffee). 

Bonus? I registered my product on Keurig's website and received a great deal on K-cups. Yes, they're not the most environmentally friendly products, but that's also not a legitimate reason -- in my opinion -- to give the machine a poor review. The machine works as advertised and, honestly, if you're into being "green", why are you even pondering purchasing this type of item in the first place? 

You can purchase a reusable K-cup (the "My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter") that allows you to brew the coffee of your choice -- an added bonus for this line of machines. Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter

I have been a long time Windows user and have switched to Apple Leopard.  I finally got so fed up with the Vista operating system that I ordered a Mac Book from Amazon.  I received the package on time, the ordering process was painless - just a few clicks.  I got a newest version of this laptop.  Not really knowing what to expect from this little laptop, I was pleasantly surprised that the learning curve is a lot easier than I thought it would be.  I am very impressed with the way this laptop works, it is fast, it looks fantastics, and oh, my God, it turns on quicker.  I have had Vista for a long time and sometimes I had to sit and wait for the operating system to start up (as long as 12 minutes - timed).  This one is ready to go in about 30 seconds, got to love it.

I have had my KitchenAid Pro 600 mixer for about a month. So far, it has worked very well for small batches of bread and pizza dough, a large batch of chicken salad, and a large batch of pimento cheese. It did not do very well when I tried a small batch of cream cheese blended with jam. The volume of the ingredients in the bowl was not enough to allow the mixer to mix them well. I may need to adjust the height of the bowl to get it to work better.

The licorice color is terrific. It's a matt black finish that cleans easily. 

The service from Amazon was also terrific. I placed my order on Saturday and received the mixer on Monday--just two days.

I'm on my third one.  In three months.  The belt clip is poorly designed - it's made for a narrow belt, not an elastic band - the type found on 99.9% of sweat pants and shorts.  The clip pops off easily. If you're on grass or a soft surface, you will NOT hear it hit the ground.

A clip with a stronger spring, or that looks more like a cell phone clip (with that hook at the base) would be a great improvement.

I did notice it immediately the 15 or so times it came off while on the treadmill, and a couple of times on the street. Not while on or near grass. A few times I noticed it was gone - only because I was in the habit of checking - and went back to find it.  Two times, no such luck.

So with number three, it's in the pocket - no more belt clip. Too expensive to toss them away each month.  So be warned - you WILL lose the meter if you rely on the belt clip.

Data transfer: easy - but the software is VERY basic. Also, you can NOT merge data files as the manual states. So of you have records on two PC's for example - say a laptop on vacation and your desktop at home - you can't merge the files. You also can't enter data manually - a huge programming oversight.

Setup was fast - but has to be performed on the meter - you can't set anything from the PC. This should be a programming no-brainer - pull the date and time from the PC' allow changing stride, etc. from the software. But no-brainer seems to describe the person involved in designing the software.

"Heroes" set a really high bar for itself in its fantastic first season.  It was truly a hard act to follow, and judging from the fandom's strangely critical reaction to the first season's stellar finale, the fans would be sure to crucify the show if it didn't produce a Season Season that was even better than the first season.  It's true that this, the second season of "Heroes," is a step down from the first season, but there is no way in the world that this is a bad--or even an average--season of television.  There is a lot of great stuff going on here, and the good far, far outweighs the bad.

Let me start off with the not-so-good stuff, to get that out of the way.  The Micah (and, to a lesser extent, Nikki) plot definitely wears a bit on the patience, but that's no different than Season One.  The writers try to put those characters in new settings to spice up their arcs a bit, but compared to the rest of the season, it feels like filler.  I wasn't so keen on the Maya/Alejandro/Sylar plot for the majority of the season, though it does get quite a bit better by the last few episodes.  I was wary, in general, with the idea of bringing Sylar back.  He wasn't a threat until the very last episodes, and I think that Hiro's character arc would have been so much stronger if they had just let Sylar be dead.  In fact, the only major, major mistake that the writing team makes here is never letting a main character die.  It appeared that five characters were dying in the end of Season One, but every single one of them survived that battle.  Much in the same way, what happens to Noah Bennett in the end of "Cautionary Tales" was a very bad decision.  Like any television  season, it has its imperfections.  They're no where near enough for me to buy that any person could watch this and give it an unbiased one-star rating, but the flaws do put it a notch below the first season.

Now for the good stuff.  And there is a lot.  The character arcs for the most part are great, and what makes this even better is that all of the actors have improved immensely and are able to add a lot of emotional weight to their performances.  Mohinder Suresh is taken on such a journey this season, and even Hiro's story--which, when I first heard what it would be, sounded awful--was one of the most entertaining stories told this season.  I loved what happened to Peter and Nathan and how they were kept apart for most of the season, which really added tension to the scenes when they'd mention each other.  The new characters that get introduced, both heroes and villains and morally ambiguous people, are thrilling, especially the sadistic yet vulnerable Elle, played perfectly by Veronica Mars's Kristen Bell, who helps to make this season great.  The consistent quality of each episode is quite high, though the last third of the season definitely steps it up to the quality we had in Season One.

This was the season I was most looking forward to buying on DVD this summer (where I watched it for the first time), though it was also the season I was most scared to watch, due to the negative reviews.  Perhaps its a better season watching it as a whole, but fans who were worried like me have nothing to fear.  It's not quite as good as season one, but the drop in quality is only a very small step.  This is still very, very good television.

I got this little rice cooker because I just could not make consistent rice in the microwave or on the stove top. This rice cooker produces perfect rice everytime from long grain to sushi rice. The quality is just as good as a larger rice maker but you can make rice for just one or two if you would like.

Dr H is fantastic - almost Shakespearean in its combination of comedy and tragedy.  I won't repeat all the good points from previous reviews - but we really need more things like this to succeed, which bypass the Hollywood middlemen.  Even though it was available on the web as a free download, it seems worth supporting projects like this financially so people can make them without the content cartels getting their fingers in the pie and messing up the recipe.  Hollywood is afraid of this business model, but I want it to succeed - it puts creative control back in the hands of the people actually doing the work, and also gives them the rewards rather than having an endless series of middlemen glommed on to take their cut.

So support quirky and cool little projects like this.  Support independent musicians and artists.  Just say no to the RIAA.

I love the look and the convenience; however the coffee comes out very weak when using the medium cup or the larger mug setting.  A remedy for this is to interrupt the brewing process.  Basically when the coffee just starts to drip, I open up the lid and stop it for 20-30 seconds, thus allowing the k-cup to pre soak.  Then I close the lid and the brewing continues.  The coffee comes out awesome.  You don't even need to buy the extra bold cups.  I wish Keurig had a slower drip setting to get the most of each k-cup, but my method works pretty well.

This is the second tub of whey that I've bought from Optimum Nutrition. The first was the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Natural Whey, Chocolate, 5.13-Pound Tub. In the future I'll go back to buying the 100% Natural version because this one is just too sweet. The 100% Natural had just the right amount of sweetness but was not overwhelming. The first time I tried this one I almost gagged because it was so much sweeter. Now, this is coming from a person who thinks most of today's popular cereals are too sweet. It still tastes very good and packs the same amount of protein. Strictly as a protein I'd rate it a 5, but, with the 100% Natural tasting better, I'm only giving this version 4 stars.

The Acer Aspire One removes "lugging my computer" from my vocabulary. I've been using it a month and there are no bugs so far. I found the keyboard surprisingly easy to use, and the screen resolution is crisp.

I used it for a presentation at a large venue last week, and the 20' wide projected images were perfect (note: you must use the Fn/F5 buttons as on/off and select switches...this computer does not automatically interface with a projector).

There is plenty of space for storage and the battery lives up to its billing, but the response time is a bit slower than I expected with 1GB RAM. Hence the 4 stars.

First I have to say...good luck getting to the software because the case is very difficult to open.

The product is very different for experienced Microsoft Office users who have been used to Office 2003.  It will take a few weeks to get used to it, so if you have classes that need the use any of the Office 2007 program, keep your 2003 software until you feel comfortable using the 2007 software.  Some features are off the wall when trying to find what you need.

Otherwise, the product is very nicely setup.

I've owned 2 other pedometers before purchasing this one, and found it more accurate in counting steps than the previous ones I've owned. It comes with a strap that attaches to the bottom of the pedometer, which
I use all the time, since the clip on holder doesn't stay attached to
your clothes that well, and I would've lost it many times without that
strap.  I clip the holder to the inside of my pants pocket and found it
stays better than clipping to your waist.

It also comes with software that is for windows only, not Mac OS. The
software is very cool, and keeps you motivated in keeping up with your
daily steps.  The data easily downloads from the pedometer, and if you
don't download everyday, the pedometer stores up to 7 days worth of data,
so you don't lose data if you transfer a few days later.  The other
nice thing is you can set up your own daily goals, so you can start out
easy and change your goals as you get stronger.

Overall, this pedometer is a good value for a very reasonable price, and
I would definately purchase this item again without a second thought.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)

      



I'm not sure why some others have described Bella as being whiny in this book, in my opinion it is the opposite, you rarely hear her complain about Edward leaving because it is too painful, instead she presses on the best she can.  Is she hurt and depressed, of course but can you blame her?  There is sadness in this book, but it isn't unbearable (for the reader), in fact, I found it realistic emotionally.  I was worried about Bella whining her way through this book because of her arguement with Edward at the end of Twilight.  I think that she can be a little childish sometimes (but then again, she is a child), but all in all, I really found little to no whining in this book, and I can't even recall her complaining at all.  She mostly dealt with her feelings alone so I don't see who she could have whined and complained to...

I found the story line of Jacob to be incredibly interesting and exciting, and I can't wait to see what develops.

I guess my point to all of this is, don't let a couple of impatient reviewers spoil your desire to read this book, I felt that it was a fabulous sequel and  I'm glad I didn't let others ruin it for me.  Yes it is different from twilight, but come on, Stephenie can't tell the same story over and over again can she?  I loved it's difference, and I am so pleased to have read it.

This is a beautiful movie, well cast well made and a story well told.

I am sure that there will be criticism from viewers who do not have the patience to follow the story through but then that is part of the charm of the film.

The film begins with the narration of a semi-celebrity professor crowing over his ability to seduce students after their graduation from his course as a confession of the abuse of his position to fuel a lifestyle of selfish self-promotion.

When he meets a student who does not fall immediately for his charms he becomes enveloped in a relationship which awakens feelings that he had previously not encountered. we learn about him from the conversations he has with his best friend and the confidences they hold about each other and from the interactions with two other significant characters, his estranged son from a failed marriage and a woman with whom he has a casual yet regular sexual relatonship. 

Our knowledge about the student is released slowly rather like peeling the layers of an onion and we follow the relationship which becomes soured by his obsessive jealousy and selfishness. Eventually that selfishness overcomes his feelings of love for the woman and she disappears from his life although the aftermath of their breakup dogs him as he struggles to come to terms with that and the implications of it.

In a conclusion which is not as the plot has carefully laid out, the couple are reunited through a tragic event which allows their feelings to be exposed.

This is a tender, slow drama which goes to a great extent to establish the network of relationships between a few people in order to bring forth an analysis of how modern life in a post-industrial society has resulted in fragmentary relations involving sex without love or care and where real relationships are the exception rather than the rule.

Each of the actors involved have gone to considerable trouble to avoid extreme positions to create very real and reasonable people who have considerable credibility. Not for everyone perhaps but a very rich film to watch and ponder upon.

First of all,I'm not going to state how I felt on specific parts of the book,that is for discussion,and I don't want to ruin anything for anyone. 

Before I started reading this book,I wanted to get an idea of what other Twilight fans thought of it. I really didn't think many had finished,I mean,it had only been about an hour or so since it was released and I doubted there would be more than 100 reviews on here. Well,there were far more than a hundred,and to my horror,the rating was a one and a half star! I scrolled down,reading "what was Meyers thinking,powerful message destroyed,disappointed,etc,"and I thought oh no! It took alot not to read the spoilers,but I managed and proceeded to Ch.1,preparing for the worse. 

As soon as I started,I couldn't put it down. Well actually,I did,I mean,I still had to work and sleep,unfortunately. Then of course,I put it down a couple of times due to frustration,annoyance,etc. You might be thinking,"wait,what? you were frustrated? how could you possibly have liked it then?!"That is exactly why. Meyers once again pulls you in and keeps you,making you forget this is just a book,these are only characters in a story,and instead feeling as if these characters were real,and you were fortunate enough to watch their lives unravel right before your very eyes,being caught up in the frustration,the passion,the love,the anger,the excitement,the hurt,every single emotion of it all. Heck,I even began to love Jacob after reading his part. Believe me,I was no where close to joining Team Jacob,I wanted him out of the picture after Edward's return,but yet,there he was in book 3! I was not happy. And then,here he was again,with his own pov,a huge chunk of the book at that! I was so close to skipping it,but fearing I would miss something big,I continued. I'm sure glad I did. Afterward,I understood him much better,how it was so hard for Bella to let go of him. Shoot,with as many times as he made me laugh,it'd be hard for me to let go of him too!

Something else I loved about the book- Bella's growth. Specifically in the third part. It was all about Bella,standing on her own. She was making decisions on her own,without thinking of what Edward would do or say.Her life no longer revolved on just Edward,but now also,more on the ppl around her,strangers,friends,family.I mean,Edward was still a HUGE part of course,but he wasn't the only part. Plus,it was not so focused on just their love,but also on the unexpected,standing together for what's right,for freedom,how being strong,courageous,and having hope pays off in the end. 

Others have questioned the reality of it all,the portrayal that one can receive so much happiness,that everything will work out for them;there can be a happily ever after.To which I ask,why not? what's so wrong for fighting for what you believe in and gaining instead of losing? Impossible? I think not.

This product is very good for the price. It is NOT the best, but the "best" is only marginally better and costs 3x the price. If you are taking 2-3 shakes a day that can really add up. At the start of 2006, I'd say Biotest produce the best products, you can read about them at T-Nation. HOWEVER they are very expensive and this is a fine product. I would give it 5 stars except it is a bit below the quality of others. Most protein brands I would only give 2 or 3 stars.

I am writing this review to help anyone who is unsure, as I was, about FLAVOUR and MIXABILITY. You can read detailed reviews on the bodybuilding website.

The flavour is not bad. Mixed only with water, it is not bad at all. Which is important because you will be taking it all the time. I have only tried Vanilla, which I prefer as a flavour, since you can mix it with other things, such as orange juice. The fact that it mixes with water and tastes OK is a great bonus. 

Mixability - it is about 90% the mixability of the current best in the world. Most powders out there are 80% mixable at best. I mix with a spoon. But really, it pretty much mixes itself. I use it with soda water which fizzes, I put a bit of water in the cup, put the powder on top, stir it - and it fizzes to the top of the cup. Then I stir it up, add more water and it is done. When drunk, there is almost NO residue. That means no washing up. There are always small amounts that are not mixed, but these are very small indeed, and who cares your stomach will mix them. When drunk, the cup needs only a light rinse in water and is practically clean - the best cleanup of any product I have ever seen. Note that these useability benefits - clean mixing, easy cleanup - are essential if you are going to use the stuff multiple times a day. Who wants a trail of dirty cups along the sink? 

Hope that helps. I certainly would recommend this product to anyone as the base of their protein, even if you can afford the more expensive brands. 

Good luck with your training.

This toaster oven is exactly what I needed.  Great size, not too big (some are huge) and not too small.  Took a few attempts to get a handle on the cooking setting.  Does a great job once mastered--in the first week we baked muffins and nachos.  Far better than using a big oven for such small items.  Reheated pizza very nicely as well.  As far as toasting, the bottom side toasts better than the top but we can live with it.  

Much better looking than I expected as well.  Not an eyesore on the counter (which I have VERY LITTLE).  You need to keep in mind this product will help eliminate using a larger appliance for small tasks--not replace your main oven.  The price tends to fluctuate so keep an eye for periodic reductions.  Definitely worth the money though.

I recently received this router as a gift from a friend - a computer geek :-).  Since I am not very savvy when it comes to the "tech" part of things, I have come to rely on him for recommendations and help.  Of course, he helped me get things working.  It helped, I believe, that I have a Mac (He also totally sold me on Macs, too - amazing how much more friendly they are to work with than PCs).  I probably could have figured out how to get it working on my own, but was glad that I didn't have to.  What I can say, though, is that it is AWESOME!  I haven't any significant difficulties.  Once in a while I will lose the internet connection for a heartbeat on my laptop.  However, it is a minor inconvenience, and now I can even work outside.  I also love the fact that I am not tied down to my computer any more, and am able to hear the programs and music that are on itunes in other parts of my home, thanks to this router and Airport Express (and, of course, my friend!)

Like some of the other reviewers, I bought this unit and THEN found out that it needs to be plugged into the wall. It turns out that if you want an external USB hard drive that's powered off the USB port, you need to look for the word "portable" in the description. So minus one star for not making it clear in this product's description that external power is required.

Otherwise, this is a solid unit that gets the job done. It's fine for adding storage to a machine, as opposed to moving data around from place to place. I've successfully used it with Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Linux; plug and play in all cases.

I was a freshman away at college in 1986-87 and I still recall as anticipated events the monthly arrival of The Watchmen (which were originally released in twelve issues.) Now fourteen years later my appreciation has only grown; there are elements that impress me now at 32 that I missed as a teenager. This is not a graphic novel that you outgrow; it's one that you grow into.Some of the social issues are outdated, and as a society we're now to an extent concerned with a new set of issues and concerns. However, there are many timeless elements which the series masterfully explores: an individual's responsibility to society, a superpower nation's responsibility for global order, aging, mental illness, and a host of more intimate reflections revealed in the web of personal histories of each of the characters. And on top of all of this, it is a beautiful piece of work to look at. That notwithstanding, you sometimes fail to notice the artwork because it so sea!mlessly tells the story. Note: '86-87was a watershed year in graphic novels in which two Frank Miller series were released as well: Elektra Assassin (with Bill Sienkiewicz's excellent artwork) and The Dark Knight Returns. Both of which I highly recommend as well. In the ensuing years I have not found graphic novels with this depth and originality and have therefore lost interest in the genre, but these three works are still a joy to read!

I wanted a small, cheap laptop I could use for email and word processing.  This one does the job perfectly and gave me no unpleasant surprises.  For extended typing I attach a full-size external keyboard, but the keyboard on the Aspire One is decent enough.  I definitely appreciate the extra battery time from the six-cell battery, which doesn't really affect portability.

My dog already knew how to run along with the bike. We practiced a summer with me holding on to her retractable leash until we got the hang of it. This being dangerous and tiring though I searched for a better way and found the Walky Dog and the Springer. After researching and carefully considering, I chose the Walky Dog. It is perfect. Well designed and solid it holds tightly to the bike with a clamp that has a release to pull off the extra arm when you don't need it. The spring system works well and I ride in security, as my 50 pound border collie runs along with. I'd have to be moving very slowly and turning for her to pull me off balance. My only complaint is that the rope is a little short. She is kept in a pretty narrow zone next to the bike, which offers a sense of safety but also limits her flexibility in dealing with terrain. I may thread a new rope to add just 2-3 inches and give her more leeway. But I am working with it as is for now before deciding. This is an excellent product, although I would hesitate a bit to start a dog out on this as there isn't much opportunity to communicate in a gradual way. You are either going or not and the dog is pretty much compelled to go along. So be sure your dog understands the idea, isn't afraid of the bike and likes to run with you before you just hop on and go.

I bought this router two months ago. Before I bought it, I read the reviews at Amazon.com. No router got consistent reviews. People who bought Netgear routers suggested people to buy Linksys, Belkin or D-link. People who bought Linksys suggested to buy other three routers... Since I had a $40 gift certificate, I went ahead for this one. 

After I inserted the CD into my CD drive on a Vista computer, the CD cannot do auto-run, a default functionality for software installation. Since I know how to run software installation manually (double-click setup.exe), it is not a big problem for me. During setup, the software asked me to create passwords and then the software generated a 26-character key. I have to enter the key to setup the adapter on my computers. There is no way to remember the computer-generated key. I have to keep it in a safe place in case I use it later. It is not as convenient as the passwords, which I can remember. 

After I setup the router and adapters, the network runs smoothly. I cannot tell the speed difference between the wire connection and the wireless connection. I placed the router inside my home entertainment center where the Comcast cable is located. I have a desktop and a notebook. The maximum distance from the router to an adapter is about 15-20 yards. I did not experience any connection drop as some people mentioned here.

In general, I am happy with this Netgear router. I recommend people to buy it. I wish that the setup can be more user-friendly. A $40 product should be fool-proof. This is a reason that I knock down 1-star in my rating.

This unit replaces a Cuisinart Grind & Brew coffee maker. While it was a convenient machine, it was extremely difficult to keep clean and with only one regular coffee drinker in the house it had limited value.

The Keurig brews a single cup of coffee in about a minute. My unit included a set of sample coffees and they are all quite good, although my plan is to use the "My K-Cup" to brew my own coffee. 

There is a built-in clock and timer, which may not sound important but it will let you warm-up the coffee machine and have it automatically turn off after a period of inactivity. This allows you to have the machine ready at 6AM and right before you hop in the car you can push a button and get a cup of coffee. Without the warm-up cycle, you may need to wait a minute or two before you can start brewing.

Counter space can be maximized especially if you have a corner spot where you can place this. Filling up the water reservoir is straightforward, and unlike a traditional coffee maker there really should be no need to pull the Keurig forward since the water can be poured from the front.

Cleanup is a breeze, the drip-tray can be easily removed for hand-washing along with the water reservoir. The K-Cup holder can also be removed for occasional cleanup. 

So far my only gripe is the My K-Cup has proved difficult to load correctly. The results from brewing my own coffee has produced watery cups with some aftertaste. Variations in the amount of coffee grinds has produced considerable grades of flavor, and I'm worried this might not be something I can master.

In terms of the machine itself, the water reservoir can be a little tricky to remove and comes out best when done slowly. I know this was a popular holiday gift a few years ago, but I'm glad I waited to have a machine that will accept my own coffee and uses an extremely popular standard cup (K-Cup).

Love or hate this film, it has a cult fallowing, Howard The Duck is a first class guilty pleasure and I mean that in a good way.

So anyway here's the story, Howard comes home to relax one day, the next thing he knows is that all of a sudden he's being zapped to our planet, while trying to get back to his home planet, along the way he falls in love with a feisty rock chick named Beverly Switzler and has to stop a monster know as a Dark Overlord before it causes the end of the world.

The film is based on a Marvel comic series created by Steve Gerber, who sadly passed away last away a year ago ( R.I.P. dude ), if you ever read the comics they are worth reading, especially the 2002 Marvel Max series, in which the story was a fallow up to the film.

This film is fun, funny as hell and some very good FX for a film that out in the 80's, the only thing that sucks is that the DVD has no special features but it don't matter.

None the less Howard The Duck is one of my all time favourite film I saw when I was kid and I still like watching today.

Highly recommend!

We have never owned a blood pressure monitor so have nothing to compare it with, but it seems to be accurate based on occasional visits to the "real" ones at the Doctor's office. I like the "averaging" option which takes three consecutive readings in one sitting (I can choose the wait time interval), because readings do vary a bit...which I suspected and which is why we bought this in the first place. For example in the office a nurse took a reading followed 3 minutes later by another taken with a different (hand-held) instrument, and the systolic showed a 30 point variation! 

This machine has shown a 10 point systolic variation in the three readings. What I like is being able to take several readings during the day to see what the range is, and the software then charts it very nicely and shows clearly what he trend is over time. 

I highly recommend this unit, and can't imagine why anyone would need something more expensive.

I am not a big coffee drinker.  I like a cup in the morning and that's about it.  After that I drink tea and the occasional cup of decaf coffee in the evening.  This coffee maker is perfect for that.  It is quick, easy, and requires no clean up.  It doesn't make a super strong cup of coffee but that's OK with me, and Green Mountain coffee has a couple of strong coffees in K-cups that work very well with the coffee maker-Sumatran Reserve and Dark Magic.  I've found Green Mountain to be the best coffee for the Keurig. I don't recommend making tea using the tea k-cups.  Tea needs to steep and doesn't get the chance with this coffee maker so it ends up being very weak-think hot water with almost no flavor to it.  However, I use it to heat water for my tea and that's also quick and easy.  It makes a little noise when filling but it's only for 30 seconds or so.  I don't leave my pot on all day because I don't use it enough to make that worthwhile.  It only takes a couple of minutes for it to be ready to brew after I turn it on.  I'm also glad that I got the model that makes just one size cup-7.25oz.  I don't need all of the other sizes and if I'm going to use a travel mug I'll just use a second k-cup and brew into the same mug.  I'm glad I didn't waste the extra money on the fancier models.  This model is perfect.

This blood pressure monitor is far easier to use than others I have tried.  The pre-formed cuff is simply to apply with no pinching of the skin and no fumbling to position it properly.  A comparison with the doctor's office showed very accurate readings.  The memory feature makes it so simple to keep track of readings.  I (and my doctor) recommend this affordable monitor to anyone who needs to watch their blood pressure.

I had a Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Maker and hated it!  Water ran all over, it was bulky and not friendly to use.  I bought this Hamilton Beach one and from day one, we loved it!  It is more compact and so easy to use.  Sometimes we use ice (as it calls for), but most times, I just put water to the water fill line, pour it in the ice tea maker, fill the pitcher to the water line again with water and when finished, refrigerate.  I experimented with the strength and we found that if you set the setting to "strong" and use 2 Big Lipton Tea Bags, it comes out perfect every time.  I don't flavor it with lemon and sugar because some people like it plain.  I add my own lemon and sugar to my glass and it is the best iced tea I ever had!  Great product and I would highly recommend.

This review is from: Iron Man (Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)

      



Iron Man was a lesser-known hero in the Marvel universe.  He wasn't as well known as Spider-Man, the Hulk, Captain America, or the Fantastic Four.  Therefore, it was a bit surprising that in their freshman film as an independent film company that Marvel would choose Iron Man as the hero that their future would either be built or destroyed upon.  All doubts, however, have been put aside as 2008 has come to be the year that comic book movies became serious works of cinematic art, beginning with the release of IRON MAN.

IRON MAN revolves around Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), a billionaire whose fortune was built upon arms manufacturing to defend the free world from totalitarianism, tyranny, and terrorism.  Stark is also a brilliant scientist and engineer who designs many of his own weapons and devices.  While unveiling a new missile to American troops in Afghanistan, Stark is knocked unconscious, receives a heart injury, and is captured by terrorists.  The group calls themselves the Ten Rings.  They want Stark to build them a replica of the missile he just created for the U.S. Army.  Stark gets to work, but instead of building the weapon the terrorists requested, he builds a suit of power armor that he uses to escape from the terrorist camp.  After returning to the United States, Stark decides that his company, Stark Industries, is no longer going to be in the arms manufacturing business.  Seeing what his weapons can do when placed in the wrong hands is too much and he decides that the company will take a new direction.  He's convinced by his partner and good friend Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) to take some time off.  Stark uses that time to prefect the suit he created in the Middle East.  Meanwhile, Stane has plans of his own and the direction Tony wants to take the company in doesn't fit in Obadiah's plans.

IRON MAN is an excellent comic book movie.  The acting is solid, the script well-written, and the direction superb.  The movie completely revived the career of Robert Downey, Jr. and turned Jon Favreau from being just a comic and family-film director into being a major directorial player.  Though hinting at a darker future (as well as plot developments for future sequels), the film is full of hope, optimism, and good old American patriotism.  When one thinks about it, IRON MAN is the type of movie that SUPERMAN RETURNS should have been a couple years ago.  I guess iron really is stronger than steel.

While I have had several desktop Macs, with Intel processors, my notebook for the past few years had been an aging, though gorgeous, 12-inch Powerbook G4. With the release of these new Macbooks in October 2008, I knew it was time for me to upgrade to a notebook with the performance of my iMac. 

Design - One of the most striking elements, for me, about thew new 13-inch MacBooks is that Apple has went to the aluminum enclosure, for this consumer priced machine. The aluminum notebooks from Apple have always looked, felt, and held up quite nicely, my Powerbook is a testament to that. Now, the aluminium form factor is available starting at $1299. 

This particular notebook is perhaps the best feeling of any notebook I have held. Upon opening it from the box, I was immediately impressed. While feeling light and sleek, it feels sculpted from a block, so very solid. This must be due to the new unibody structure that Apple is touting. I don't know how they do it, but I do agree it feels wonderful on your lap and looks great on your desk. 

Performance - The performance of the new MacBooks have really taken a step forward. While the Core 2 Duo Processors are about the same speed as the last generation of the plastic MacBooks, the graphics in these notebooks are on another level. The new Nvidia graphics in the notebook is keeping up with my aluminum iMac's graphics, impressive for a notebook! The magazines that have reviewed the notebook say the same thing. The graphics performance on this Macbook is 3-5 times faster than the previous Intel Integrated Graphics. This is a solid step forward. 

2 GB Memory - This is a sufficient amount, for the type of applications many people will run with Mac OS X. I use 4 GB on my iMac, but 2GB for my notebook is fine. If I want more later, I can swap it out. 

Hard Drive - For the first time, the hard drive is easy to access in the MacBook. This is great! Not only can you upgrade to a faster or bigger hard drive, when you need to someday, it will prolong how long you can use this notebook. Hard drives are one of the weaker points in a computer due to the physical moving parts. With this notebook, we have easy access to the battery and hard drive, so if everything else keeps running, we can keep this notebook going for years, something that makes me feel good about the investment. I have wished user accessible hard drives on a Mac notebook, and it finally happened. 

Super Drive - It's still nice to be able to watch and burn DVD disks. 

Software - The lastest version of Mac OS X Leopard is included alongside iPhoto, iTunes, iMovie, iDVD, etc. A lot of great programs to get the new Mac users going. 

Connections - I have several Firewire devices, so I was sad to see Firewire removed from the MacBook. However, USB has been so much more successful that you can understand Apple's move. Thankfully, most of my firewire devices are USB compatible as well. 

Overall, I seriously considered the MacBook Air, when it came out back in January. However, I'm glad I waited and that Apple released this 13-inch Aluminium MacBook. To me, it feels even better in your hands and on your lap than the Air, plus you get a significantly faster computer with user replaceable battery and hard drive. While the glare on the glass screen is terrible compared to the matte display on my old Powerbook, images and movies do look a lot better and "pop." I'm glad I decided on the MacBook. I haven't had any issues, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a new notebook.

My Cavalier King Charles Spaniel had stains under her eyes. Also, the white fur on her chest and paws had turned pink. I bought this as a last resort, not really expecting it to work. AMAZING! Within a month or so, her eyes cleared up completely, AND her chest and paws turned nice and white again (apparently it was yeast from her eyes or tongue causing the pinkness). It's amazing to find a product that actually does what it claims!  BTW, I had fed all my dogs liver for years, and that did not do it. It's something about the concentration or process, I guess. Angel's Eyes works!

Yes, it does fit in my shirt pocket, with my cell phone. It's a small stretch but it does fit. It holds 200+ of my movie files. Great for file transfer. My son said he dropped it on the "carpeted" floor shortly after I bought it and it still works (I don't recommend this). I don't know if you can delete the set-up programs after set up (it would be nice if they told you 300+ MB of extra space).  Ooo, yes you can! All-in-all I think this is a good product.

I'm a trainer who was skeptical as to whether this rather low-priced collar would be effective on a German Shepherd, but I'm pleased!

My dogs aren't nuisance barkers, but are territorial and didn't like getting a new neighbor & sharing our fence with his dog.  I bought one collar for my female - the 'lead' barker.  After just a few zaps from 'God', she got the idea and no longer barks. The gradual correction levels give her warning enough that she sometimes still gets off a bark or two before pushing her luck. and she's still able to whine a grumble a bit without getting corrected.  

MOST IMPRESSIVE is the fact that the collar somehow wound up in a cooler at our Christmas party, submerged in water for about 3 days before it was found.  It still worked perfectly!
I'm getting a second collar now for my male, who has decided to take over where the female left off.  While I still have some additional problem solving to do to keep them from running at the fence with the neighbor dog, this collar at least keeps it quiet and less aggressive.

I don't believe this type of collar will solve every barking problem, but for my target issue, I'm pleased.

I purchased one of these a few weeks ago for use as my primary computer.  I am a full time college student and use a bicycle instead of a car so I wanted something lite to save my back.
  I chose the ASUS because of the longer battery life and functional keyboard.  Also I was able too get it without sales tax since I live in CA so it was cheaper than a competitors site.

So here is my take: 

The screen is small, but it is not too bad.  The Keyboard is a big deal for me because I do type lab reports on this.  I have found it to be fully useable and am able to touch type as almost fast as on a full sized keyboard. The keys are smooth and do not feel cheap.
  The battery life I get is about five hours, which seems good.  You are supposed to fully charge it before you use it the first time and I didnt do that.   
  You need to be in a quiet place to use the speakers.  The webcam is ok.
I put OpenOffice on mine as it only comes with MS Works and OO has a better GUI.
  It boots to the user accounts password page in about 30 seconds, which strikes me as fast, I don't have much to compare it to except for the PC's at the JC and they take forever.
  Everyone who has handled my ASUS has complimented it's "cuteness" and commented that it feels sturdy.
  The only other netbook I have handled is the ACER aspire one that they sell at Walmart.  I think that the 8.9 inch size would still be useable for typeing  however it would be difficult.

The coffee stays hot for hours, the top is pretty simple for me, unlike I guess some other people's experiences, it's easy to use.. good for "one cup" for me (little under "3" on the side coffee measure) and fine to brew a whole pot.

Heart break is a story that can be told different ways. The recovery and strength from a heart break can change the person and story. This book is a story of how love can make a person do things they normally wouldn't and how is prevails in the end. If you are a reader who roots for the main characters this is a book you have to read, but only if you read the series. Stephenie Meyers is a very good story teller and is able to use words to bring you into the story and feel the same emotions as her characters!

After reading other reviews about the Linksys-Cisco WRT54Gl,I finally swollowed the fear in my throat and bought it.  It connected just fine. After I had a little schooling and help with minor things of my own inexperience, from a neice,I was wireless and on my way,and have been connecting with no problems ever since. Oh..yeah..it's been about a month now,and I do recommend this product.

It's a good product, works with Vista seamlessly. Lots of bites for your programs and data. I can download and re-install all programs after I accidently format the drive. You can even install more free programs for your own convenience. I definitely recommend it.

I don't know how people live without one of these. Unfortunately, I left mine in a hotel in Cabo San Lucas and don't want to bother trying to have it mailed back. It has been a week and I have to buy another one. I'm used to the fresh feeling that a toothbrush, toothpaste and mouthwash don't leave. The Panasonic leaves my mouth feeling CLEAN. I also had the 'Grossan Original Throat Irrigator' to remove any tonsiloliths (throat stones).  It is quite pricey, $17, but worth it. It attaches perfectly to the Panasonic. The Panasonic doesn't not hold much water and you will have to fill it about two times when using, but who cares? After a while it will get dirty, but you can take it apart and wash it.

My previous game pad was clunky and unresponsive. I'd play a game that I would normally do well in with no problem using a console controller, and get stomped because the pad was so bad. So I went online, and looked at other options for game pads and came across the Logitech Precision game pad. I read the reviews, and everyone said it was great. And at the low price of ten bucks, I decided to try it out. Let me tell you, this pad is a great way to spend ten bucks if you play games on your computer. The buttons are extremely responsive. In a section of a game I died at least 20 times in before giving up on with my old game pad, I completed it without dying once using the Logitech Precision.

In conclusion, this game pad is definitely worth every penny.

This works great!!! Small is for newborns to maybe 2 months, in my experience
but large is 3-4 or 5 month depending on length of baby...but by 5 mos. colic usually gone. These work so well in making the baby feel secure. Read the book the The Happiest Baby on the Block and your life will be changed as the baby gets relief from colic,,,,,and you'll have some well needed rest
I like the flannel over the cotton for this time of year, not too heavy. not too light for my baby. The book is adamant on swaddlersand they are correct.!!
Also, when in doubt buy larger size, baby will grow into it. This is a value when you compare to Halo brand. Does not have the convenience of a bottom zip and a removable swaddler like Halo but it does it's job nicely.
but the BOOK  mentioned is INVALUABLE to any parent of a colicky baby !!!!

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Video On Demand)

      



	There certainly is no shortage of reviews for this film (during the time of this writing there are 300 on Amazon for the Single Disc DVD and over 1000 on the iTunes store), but there has been such a strong response both in favor of and against this movie that I wanted to throw in my two cents.

	What makes this film, in my opinion, a masterpiece and not just another summer blockbuster is how deeply it involves the viewer in the action itself.  The masterful artistic element is how Christopher Nolan immerses the viewer.  For the first thirty minutes, the viewer does not expect much more than a well-done action flick, replete with special effects and hyperbolic action galore.  Bad guys are still being bad guys in Gotham City and Batman is still up to his old tricks (fancy gadgets and all) in his efforts to stop them.  However, Nolan gradually and carefully raises the stakes, and the movie develops from a typical action movie into an unnervingly honest appraisal of the natures of good and evil.  Unlike most superhero movies, The Dark Knight reaches further than Gotham's city limits - it demands a very personal reaction from the viewer.

	At two and a half hours, the Dark Knight is a very mentally and physically taxing experience for the 
viewer, as Nolan clearly intended it to be.  He carefully balances which emotions he elicits from the viewer, oscillating from uncertainty to laughter to outright terror.  This fragile balance can be (and often is) shattered at a moment's notice and then just as quickly restored through some well-timed comic relief, only heightening the overall sense of instability that dominates this film.  The viewer is constantly being denied the cathartic sense of relief so desperately needed by the film's end.  The most triumphant moments are consistently thwarted, interrupted, or otherwise overturned - so much so that the majority of the film feels dominated by desolation and hopelessness.  Since that feeling of uncertainty is so crucial to experience the full impact of the film, I won't reveal any of the story specifics or plot devices that create these "overturns", but they are obviously felt while viewing.  Nonetheless, everything Nolan does in the Dark Knight serves to further disquiet and rattle the viewer.  From the unearthly screeching of Hans Zimmer's score, to the chillingly familiar video threats made by the Joker (evoking a sense of very real terror, imitating the style of so many terrorist videos seen during newscasts these days), to the ultimate blurring between the lines of good and evil (incredibly likeable but twisted villains - the Joker - and sometimes morally ambiguous superhero in Batman), The Dark Knight complicates the traditional understanding and expectations of a superhero movie.

	Unlike other movies of the genre, Nolan's masterpiece presents a very complex understanding of morality and forces the viewer to analyze his own morality in the tense "What would I do?" moments throughout the film.  And while everything else about the movie is entirely epic and grandiose, morality is very realistically complicated and personal.  Nolan is able to successfully individualize the epic and takes the viewer through a wide range of emotional experiences.  The culmination of all the uncertainty, moral ambiguity, and terror built upon during the film make the ending of this movie, without spoiling it, one of the most rewarding experiences in modern cinema.

I wanted a keyboard that was quiet, would last, and that I could see clearly in the dark.  That is what I expected and that is what I got.  The keys are very quiet even when I'm typing very fast, and I can see everything in the dark.  I don't care about the WASD key mode, but it's cool that it can light them up.  The media keys worked very well also.

Everything else was extraneous to me, so, it did exactly what I wanted it to, so awesome.

I've had this for about 6 months, it's being used to transfer files about every other day and it's still going strong. You might think "so what?", well, never take reliability for granted when it comes to usb flash drives. As a matter of fact, never take product reliability for granted, period. When you find out that your important files are gone because your usb drive died, you'll learn to appreciate this quality too.

To say this thing is tough is an understatement. It has been on my keyring for the same 6 months and I notice no scratch DESPITE it having a matte surface in the middle; they're not kidding when they claim the casing is made of titanium. My previous cheap plastic usb drive peeled and cracked after 6 months (which is why I got this one).

The product is well designed. There are solid, noticeable detents at both positions of the slider (in and out). It only takes a very light inward pressure on the slider to move it in or out, but without that pressure the usb jack is not moving anywhere. The usb jack is never going to retract by itself when you try to plug it into the computer (unlike other cheaper stuff out there), unless you happen to press on the slider. It is also slim enough to fit into one of those tight side-by-side usb ports when the other port is occupied.

I can't comment on speed because it's not a big deal for me. All I can say is that this product is not slower than any other usb drives that I've had in the past.

The included U3 software is useful, but I have little use for it other than to secure the drive with a password. You can remove it if you want.

One last note: this thing has a quiet elegant look. Its size and heft is about perfect for a fancy key fob, yet as a usb drive it actually serves a real purpose.

In my review of Season 3, I wrote that the series had become silly, relying too much on convenient, contrived coincidence to move the plot along, and had lost its sense of adventure. 

Season 4 remedies these problems, and also fixes my main gripe with Seasons 1 & 2; namely, that the show didn't advance quickly enough and kept you in suspense for too long... long enough to milk the commercial sponsors, perhaps, but too long for the viewer, whose sense of anticipation dwindled and patience quickly wore thin. It's almost as if the producers finally sat down together for Season 4 and said, "Ok, we've got a hit show on our hands, we can't make it last forever, so let's really get down to business" and shifted the series into high gear. In my opinion, this the best Season thus far, with Season 2 a very close second. 

Many viewers of Season 4 on this site have complained that there isn't enough "value" in the DVD set on the basis of the fact that there aren't as many episodes as the previous seasons. I can only surmise that for these folks the mere ACT of sitting in front of a television is a source of entertainment... maybe it gives them enough time to polish off an extra bag of potato chips. True, Season 4 deprives them of this. Yet it still manages to produce all the suspense, intrigue, plot development and emotional punch of any of the three previous seasons. 

What it does is condense these values, and miraculously, it feels natural, not rushed. I think the reason is that the other seasons were thinly stretched out at the direction of ABC Studios, even though the producers didn't have enough material to justify the duration. Season 4 strips away scenes of our protagonists drawing patterns in the sand with twigs amidst the flickering firelight, set to irrelevant background music, where nothing occurs except blank stares off into the distance, gratifying hugs, pats of appreciation, and protracted vacant glances at the other characters. Why anyone would have a problem with this is beyond me. 

Benjamin Linus is by far the most fascinating character of the series, and his presence is even more formidable this season. I miss the balance provided by Charlie's character (he provided relief, not necessarily comic, but relief from the show's intensity in general) and he should never have been cut. I am starting to resent Hurley's presence more and more, and his continued inclusion during key plot sequences is the entire reason why I'm not giving Season 4 five stars. The actor who plays him is incredibly weak, his character is completely uninteresting, and I have a hard time chanelling this triumph over adversity that the producers want me to feel when Hurley's greatest achievements are:  a) tripping over Jacob's cabin, b) belly-flopping into the ocean, and c) sharing half of his candy bar with Benjamin Linus. At least he doesn't have a completely gut-wrenching romance for us to suffer through this season. 

Desmond transforms into another pivotal character this season, which is welcome. Kate continues to impress and the actress that plays her is improving to the point of making her character one of the strongest links in the show. The members of the "rescue ship" are flawlessly cast and I found myself completely impressed with the well-developed and expertly conceived complexity of the dynamic between its crew, the Survivors of Oceanic flight 815, and Benjamin Linus. I am now more confident than ever that Lost knows exactly where it's going, a sense that had almost disappeared by the end of Season 3. 

I would say to anyone hitting a rut with previous seasons or episodes of the series that they ought to endure the dry spell, and stick with the series long enough to earn the privelege of watching Season 4. Excellent work ABC.

I loved the whole series.  The first book was the best but not all books are going to be light and airy.  They have to have conflict.  I have literally read the entire series in less than a week because I could hardly put the books down.  They were wonderful, perfectly written and had to have all the conflict.  I loved it.  I cant wait to read what else she has.  People need to stop complaining about certain issues and just enjoy a romantic story and move on.  It wasnt for life application, just a really good read.

Wall-E lives up to the hype I heard about it.  The storyline is excellent.  This little, yet extremely durable, robot really has some character about him.  When a new robot lands on the earth, Wall-E finds someone to share his lonely world...Lucky for Wall-E it was a female robot.  Lucky for the viewers too, I guess.  The two end up on a wild adventure out in space with some out of shape humans and robots in need of repair.  

The comedy in Wall-E is great fun and a joy to watch unfold on the screen.  Pixar almost always seems to deliver a great product.  Wall-E is no exception.  Buy this movie, pop some popcorn, and sit back and enjoy a work of art!

I love the fact SciFi/Universal has decided to break these series sets into 10 episode packages.  Yes, I LOVE IT.  

Many people here don't seem to understand that DVD sales are one of the only things keeping these superb cable genre shows on the air right now.   These smaller DVD sets give you the option to directly support your favorite shows in a way that was NEVER possible before.  So many  amazing genre shows died in the past, before the age of the DVD.

Rather than complaining about having -the option- to directly support the best show on TV through the purchase of these convienient 10 episode DVD packages why not simply wait for the full season set? 

I don't have cable so these smaller packages are great because they allow me to keep up with the series without having to wait a year between each season release.  Given the quality of the show I have absolutely no complaints about having to paying slightly more for a show that easily provides twice the entertainment value of a similarly priced show.

I don't even watch or care for television drama (the Sopranos is the only other drama I've followed in the past 10+ years), but I love "Battlestar Galactica."

After the Cylons (robots) wipe out almost all of humanity in a sneak attack, the "Battlestar Galactica" is the last remaining human warship and leads the few survivors on a search for the mythical Earth. The television show focuses on the President of the Colonies and the military leaders aboard the Galactica. The show has a gritty, realistic, military feel, but despite this, the show is much more than an action/military show: it expertly blends politics, morality, philososphy, and religion into its many plots and focuses on the many characters as they cope with the travails of humanity facing extinction.

Although still fantastic, Season 2.5 was not quite as stellar as the first season or season 2.0.  Although many of the plotlines progressed well, some of the episodes were too predictable, and the writers wrote themselves out of some interesting and tough situations with some radical actions.  Still, this season ended with a big twist, and I cannot wait for Season 3 to be released on DVD.  This is still the best television series around.

The Evenflo top of stair gate is a good find.  Relatively easy to install, simple design, and sturdy.  We have three of these (3-story house with a second set of stairs).  

To install, we needed to be a little creative to account for the plaster walls (not great with screws) and baseboard (sticks out further than walls).  We attached a small piece of wood (same thickness as baseboard) to the plaster wall.  This evened it up and gave the screws something better to latch on to. It's not necessarily pretty, but it works quite well and the baby is safe.

ACTUALLY, I TRIED TO GIVE THIS ITEM A FIVE-STAR REVIEW, BUT THE FIFTH STAR REFUSED TO SHOW. A great product!  Once the milk is heated properly and the yogurt starter is added to the heated milk this item does all the rest with great ease. I use my own one-quart Mason-type jar in the device, plug it in, cover all with a kitchen hand towel and let it incubate for SEVERAL hours. After the Mason jar, covered with its own golden lid and by itself, has then been in the fridge overnight I have a yogurt that is NOT sour tasting and that has a smooth, custard consistency. I think the long incubation period is the secret of my yogurt success.

My cats also like my homemade yogurt, and when they ever have a tummy/intestinal problem, the vets tell us to give them a spoonful of yogurt at each meal until their stomach/intestinal situ has cleared up. But for safety sake you should check w/ your vet. first, since I am not vet.

This product is so reasonably priced at Amazon that it is money well spent.

The HJ-720ITC pedometer was very easy to setup and use.  The ability to store a few days then download to my laptop makes it much more functional for me.  I have been wearing it pushed into the small coin pocket inside the regular right pocket of my jeans. It does get in the way some times but it seems to be very stable and accruate in that location.  Overall I'm very pleased with it.  While I knew there were days that I was not very active (sitting at my desk most of the day) I always thought that going up and down the stairs plus other short trips around the office and plant ammounted to a fair bit of exercise.  This device has shown me that there are days when I get a bare minimum for a person considered conscious and that my best day so far is still below what is considered the figure to shoot for on a normal day.  No guess work involved now I know and can track on a long term basis.

I currently have 2 terabytes of storage, 6 do-it-yourself "DIY" external drives housing various sized hard drives, and a MyBook. This review compares their performance. All drives are currently on-line connected to a 7 port USB hub.


In the Box

A black box housing the drive, a brick power supply, and a USB cable are key items. 2 instruction sheets, and a warranty card complete the kit. The My Book is about the size of a bible one finds in hotel and motel rooms.

The drive case, power and cables leave a very clean design. All my DIY drives comes with stands, awkward sized power supplies and cable placements that are not well thought through.

Installation

Simple: Plug the USB cable into the MyBook, and into your PC USB port. Plug in the power supply to AC and the MyBook.

The MyBook has no power switch, and turns itself on/off if the USB port is powered, when the PC is on.

The drive was recognized by WinXPSP2 without a hitch, and re-formatting the drive to NTFS was easy using WinXP built in disk utilities. The drive ships with FAT32 format, which is less desirable if NTFS can be supported. I backuped the shipped "trial" utilities inside the MyBook in case they were useful; they were not, and it was not clear were it was stored: C:\Program Files\Western Digital. I used Western Digital's disk utilities that shipped with my other drives to check partitions and drive status. These programs can also be downloaded free from Western Digital's web site.


Break-in

The drive ran over 1 week for 24/7 for a burn in, and has done a 24 hour long disk encryption format routine. it is currently a month old running 16 hours/day. Its surprisingly silent, and runs cooler than my DIY drives.

USB 2.0 Speed

It has a transfer rate of 10MB/sec. This is not the raw transfer rate, but includes delay from encryption I use. This is about 6x slower than the maximum USB transfer speed of 60 MB/sec but is the same rate as my other DIY drives.

Conclusion:

Excellent bang for buck. The cost to build a DIY external drive today may often be more than buying a pre-made external drive. USB 2.0 transfer speeds suggests the MyBook drive is a decent speed drive. The auto on/off feature is very helpful, given most DIY kits require manual power-down.

Note, there are a number of complaints about the higher end MyBook drives. The simple electronics of the low end 'Essential Edition' maybe the saving grace to this drive's performance, keep this in mind as the display boxes look the same.  Further, all drives can malfunction, so a burn-in is a must to insure your drive is not among the few bad eggs.

This pedometer is great. I carry it in my pocket- no need to clip it on, and have checked the accuracy using a measured track. It's very accurate and is a great way to be conscious of the amount of walking I do throughout the day. It's also reinforcing to be able to see the difference when I do periods of aerobic walking, because it displays them separately.

There is another review here from July 22 from someone who clearly did not use this device. this is A2DP and works great out of the box with vista, xp and osx.
it is in which is perfect for simply leaving it n your notebook without worrying about snapping it off.
I got this for a notebook, but have tried it on all my pcs as well. i have used a half dozen including the anycom which this replaced. this is faster and less troublesome than the anycom for about 1/10 the price!
the crack about "lead" by the other reviewer makes me think it is an anti china made reviewer. newflash 90% of out tech purchases are china made!

I have a 4 1/2 year old cat who's suffered from sterile cystitis since she was a young kitten.  This is rare in cats so young so it took a long time and many tests to figure out what was wrong with her.  Finally our vet mentioned that there was a possibility she had sterile cystitis and that we should try Cosequin and see if it worked.  Our first night trying it this skittish kitten who hated pills licked up half of the powder before I could even mix it in with the food!  She loved it!  Within about a week her symptoms were dissipating and we stopped noticing as much blood in her urine.  A few weeks later she was just fine, obviously not in pain anymore.  She's been on these pills about 3 years now, taking one nearly every night in a small amount of babyfood, and we've only seen a couple small, short outbreaks of her sterile cystitis, and only during periods of very high stress (such as when we moved).  

While it doesn't break the bank at the vet, it's MUCH cheaper on here, more than half off the price I've noticed.  Also we've never had a problem with it showing up late or damaged.  Since our cat could very well be on this for the rest of her life I'm so glad we have a place to buy it from that saves us so much money!

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)

      



The only other electric toothbrush experiences I had before this were the $5 Colgate battery operated from Walmart and the Braun 3D Excel (a Consumer Report favorite a few years back).

The default setting of "Clean" was too intense the first time around. It tickled my gums and I could almost not bear it.  The second time around I use the "Sesitive" setting which was more tolerable. Try number 3 back on "Clean" and all was good, though it will still take a bit getting use to. The "Massage" mode is supposed to be the easiest on the gums but not as good with the cleaning so I didn't even bother with that setting.

Everything is real easy to maintain and clean or replace parts from the diagrams provided. LED for power is clear and bright.

The toothbrush pauses during brushing four times. Each time is a sign that you should be done with that quadrant so you can move to the next. No biggie, actually a nice feature. My wife's complaint is that it just shuts off after all four quadrants are "done". She prefers the Braun 3D Excel that sends you a beeping noise signalling the end but lets you keep brushing if you want. For me, I don't care. I could always turn it back on if I really wanted to and do another cycle.

BOTTOM LINE:
My teeth feel the cleanest with this new toothbrush and it better for the price!  But if it can help save me from dental work, which could easily run into the hundreds or thousands even with insurance, then so be it. Worth the purchase/gift and I'm sure the dentist will say brushing twice a day would make life even better.

We cannot say enough good things about this gate.  We bought this gate almost four years ago for the top of our stairs (we have an open stairway in our living room to the lower level.  It is a very strong gate and has held up very well to child torture!  We really like that the gate can go both directions.  I would highly recommend this gate.

You probably know all you need about the movie itself; I'll comment on the decision to by this release of it.This DVD is AMAZING. There's &quot;remastering,&quot; and there's the professional treatment of this  classic. The picture is incredible! I'd swear it was sharper than many  contemporary movies. The sound is very clean, and is well-separated and  edited.Definitely get the gift set, if you love this movie. The extras  are well worth the added cost.

I am a college student who has been wanting to juice for a long time. I got this juicer because it was the least expensive one and the reviews were all good. I am very glad I did, because this juicer is great! The pulp is quite dry, so it makes lots of juice, the chute is large, and it is overall powerful and well-built. I also love the fact that it's so easy to clean and assemble/ disassemble. Great machine! I recommend it completely!

I've been taking Alli for about a week now in combination with a healthy diet and regular exercise.  It's too soon to tell if I've lost weight and i don't weigh myself anyway, but I know the orlistat is working because you can see the results in your stool...it's gross, but it's not anywhere near as bad as I expected.  I haven't had to use the restroom any more often than I did before i started taking it, it's just that when I do go it's oily.  You can literally see the fat in the toilet.  Strangely comforting...

I haven't needed an extra change of clothes or any of that.  I ate fast food one day and took Alli, and the next day I had to rush to the restroom.  That's the only time the side effects of Alli have been a problem so far, and I just see that as motivation to avoid greasy food.

So, I think Alli is worth the money.

This review is from: Wall-E (Two-Disc and BD Live) [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)

      



This was the first Blu-Ray disc I purchased, and it set a high bar for others to follow. The image quality is phenomenal, and it absolutely pays off in letting you notice the incredible details that Pixar put into this film. The additional content is also terrific. The Director's commentary includes thumbnails of the early artwork in the film's development. While the Director's commentary gives you the broad backstory and ideas behind the film, there's also a second commentary track, done Mystery Theater 3000 style, that points out all sorts of details and easter eggs in the movie that I'd missed. Wall-E is a fantastic film, and this Blu Ray edition helped me appreciate the movie even more.

The only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is because when it arrived, the metal ring that surrounds the mixing element was hanging down around the beater.  I was able to reattach it and it hasn't come off again, but it made me nervous that it arrived that way.  I am using the mixer more often than I thought, for not just cookies, but for dips and sausage balls (it is so much easier than using your hands!).

I've been playing with this laptop for several days now.  While I am impressed with how light it is (2.9 pounds), the battery run time (more like 5 hours as I have many programs open at once), the large enough screen (13.3 inches), what really has me impressed is the type of performance this su9300 w/ intel 4500 graphics can kick out given it's speed.  I can only imagine how quick this will run once I upgrade to an SSD.  I'm starting to think it's worth it even with the current ~$1500 price tag (I landed the 749.99 after rebate deal).  Most of the laptops with the beefier processors cause the fan to run LOUD, even the lenovo s10 netbook has a fan that's loud, and even when pushing this processor, I feel very little heat from the vent, and hear nothing.  My wife has an hp tx2500 and I can hear that from across the room!

I do, however, feel that intel has a few tricks up their sleeves in upgrading this processor, so you may want to wait for those later this year, however, this laptop will hopefully serve me faithfully for a few years, windows 7 should make this even more usable.  

Keyboard is nothing to complain about

Ergonomics is nothing to complain about, however, the "feet" that stick out of the bottom of the laptop are annoying if you place your laptop on your lap.

As for durability, I could possibly see a very slight issue with the screen, but nothing deal-breaking.  The rest of the case is extremely sturdy!

Again, with a 1.2 core 2 duo, and integrated graphics, I'm impressed, I guess I had low expectations, but don't see any real-world "performance" hits versus my wife's 2.0 dual core laptop with an ati hd3200 graphics processor with dedicated video ram. Perhaps its the ddr3 memory..

I purchased the 1st & 2nd season of Dexter as a Christmas gift for my son. He was ecstatic! My son got me hooked on this series and I could not wait for the next episode to air on HBO. I am addicted to this show and can't wait for the 3rd season to begin! If you have never watched Dexter, then purchase the 1st season and I will bet you that you will come back to order the 2nd season before HBO begins the 3rd. The DVD is great because you can watch one episode after another when originally we had to wait an entire week to see the next episode.

I bought the Clip when my iPod Mini died 3 weeks ago. I was happy to get out of Apple's control. Nowadays, the iPod is a luxury fashion item, not a solid MP3 Player. (isn't that the whole point?) I use two Macintosh computers at home and was happy to see that the Sansa supports MSC mode (mass storage mode, like flash sticks).

My first impression after I got it out of the "tamper proof" plastic shell was that it was probably the smallest gadget I'd ever seen. This thing is small... really small. If you put it in your hands, you feel like your cradling it, not holding it.

The Clip packs a very dense amount of features (unlike the iPod) in such a small space. FM Radio, Voice Recording, Radio Recording and 4GB of storage (actually 3.8). I don't know how they did it, but everything works well. The FM radio is a little spotty, but on the second floor of my house it worked excellently. I did notice one problem, that when I record my voice, it randomly skips a couple milliseconds. Not the biggest problem, but I'm sure it can be easily fixed with firmware later on.

Since I use Mac computers, I downloaded a handy script off a website that lets you use iTunes to manage your Sansa (doesn't integrate in the devices pane but it will export a playlist for you. To find this you can search "Mac sansa clip" in Google)

After a couple days using the player, it seemed to be a bit too small for a main MP3 player. I think that if I could restart, I would get the Fuze. The Clip is small, but too small to be your main player. However, there are some disadvantages to the Fuze (the $15 more expensive movel), such as the proprietary connection.

The Clip features a mini USB connector, which "sealed the deal." Almost all the new MP3 players on the market come out with a proprietary cable, and I'm glad to see that finally someone has listened. I can use my phone charger (Motorola mini USB wall charger) to charge my Clip. That's why I love this choice made by Sandisk. You can use whatever cables and power accessories you normally use, and it will just work!

Overall, a pretty nice player with many features, but a little too small for my taste. Could use a clock.

This is a very useful piece of software for anyone that needs to compile a lot of information very quickly. The ability to then go back and search the content of what you have compiled is amazing. I do consulting work and have to take notes and then go back and figure out how to make sense out of everything--not all the information I need to get down is in the form of text. I can record a conversation, add a picture, capture all or some of a web site, and more. It lets me work the way my brain is wired and that is not very often compatible with a spreadsheet. 

If I could figure out how to make it get me coffee everything would be perfect.

Ok, so I cried in this one!  It is so fantastic and Stephenie does a great job with each character (I'm not giving a synopsis--just go buy the book!)  At times I found myself reading on the edge of my seat while biting my nails in suspense.  (Who reads a book on the edge of their seat?!?) I read both books in less than a week; I couldn't put them down!  She is so talented at filling the book with true, honest emotion--and it's funny! I love how her books double back and fill in details page by page while you make your way from one incident to the next; as soon as one thing is tied up you're headed straight for another great adventure (or disaster!) Once you start reading, you'll be addicted...so clear your calendar before you start!  (And get some take-out menus, too!)

We bought this drive after owning two of the 120GB drives and being very happy with them.  The 120s are powered off of the USB, so can be used anywhere.  We noted that the 500GB drive listed did not specify portable, and clearly required AC power, while the 120 and 320 specified portable.  Without looking any further, we purchased two 320s.  They work well enough, but are not truly portable for us, as they cannot be used without AC power.  Just be aware that portable seems to be referring to physical size (??), not power source.  Our next drive will be the 250GB, which is USB powered.

We have a hallway that blocks a door going outside and down some stairs.  This hallway opening is very large.  We used this gate with two extension pieces and it works wonderfull.  We were using a standard gate before this but, now my son is 2 years old and stepping over the other gate was getting to be a pain in the neck while holding my son.  My son usually falls asleep in the car and we would have to sneak in and step over this huge gate.  Now with the hands free gate, I can easilly step on the gate opens shuts itself.  Don't worry about it slaming on little fingers because the bar is far enough away that little fingers won't get caught.  My son is a big 2 year old and he has figuires out every gate we owned.  (Even our hearth gate that goes around the fireplace)  He can't open this gate.  He knows how to do it but, he physically can't put enough weight on the footboard.  When I bought this I asks the babies r us guy if my son could get it open and he said even older children sometimes have trouble.  I tried having my next door neighbor who is 6 try and open it.  I told him how to do it and he really had to bounce on the foot board to openit.One pointer....  make sure the gate is really snug or else the top latch will not close correctly.

I first started watching this because I was annoyed with how superficial girls at school sounded when they went on about Gossip Girl. Feeling bad that I was calling them superficial behind their backs without having ever seen the show myself, I decided to watch it. At first I wasn't sure I liked it that much, but by the time it came back on TV after the writer's strike.... well lets just say that I was watching religiously by then! I found out that the TV series isn't much like the books at all, for which I am very happy! Even if you despised the Gossip Girl books, I would give the TV series a chance if you like a good chick flick now and then.

There are 2 main components of this system: the transmitter and the dog collar. The transmitter emits a radio signal that's picked up by a receiver in the collar. Whenever your pet goes too far, the collar device first produces some warning sounds, then administers the dog an electric shock. The intensity can be controlled, on a scale of 1 to 6. You also get a bunch of flags that are supposed to be visual clues for the dog during training.

I titled this review 'reliable' because we've had one of these transmitters for about 4-5 years and, after we plugged the transmitter in and set the range to the 'max', never had to revisit it. As for collars, we started with one, for one dog. We had to replace it after a couple of years because it stopped working. Since then, we bought 1 more because we have 2 dogs now.

To make it short, on our 2 puppies, we had no need to study the manual, plant little flags or any other training clues. Our training lasted about 30 minutes. As soon as they got zapped a couple of times and learned to associate the warning tone with 'run toward the house', they were fully trained. End of story.

My issue problem with this system is the range. Yes, I know, that I can buy 2 transmitters and therefore extend the range a bit but, at these prices, I can't afford to do this. All I wanted was to be able to extend the range from the current about 70-80 feet all around to maybe a 120 feet radius around the transmitter. Somehow, I think this should be quite possible.

Oh, the new collars require the somewhat expensive but a lot easier to install PetSafe batteries. Buy them from Amazon if Amazon proper is selling them (no shipping charges on $25 orders) and you will be paying about half anyone else is charging - remember, everyone else is going to add shipping charges and maybe sell taxes.

I like grilling for a healthier and tastier way of cooking my food. We live in an apartment, which means no bbq's allowed. We purchased the Le Creuset Oblong Skillet Grill which performed below our expectations. Smoke filled the apartment within 10 minutes of use because of seasonings and juices that had fallen in between the grill slots. This has a drip pan that you fill with water to catches excess juices and as the box says, makes it "almost smoke-free." As a former grill cook, I would have to say this is my grilling preference next to a traditional bbq grill.

I am not sure what MS hoped to accomplish with this version of Access, other than to make it easier for most Access users, who seem to use Access as a glorified Excel spreadsheet. Having developed in Access for many years, this major revision is a little off-putting. It looks just like FileMaker, which I personally dislike.

That being said, it has all the basic functionality of the older versions, except with a very forced FileMaker interface that is hard to overcome. You can down-convert to mdb files, so that is a good feature. Otherwise, the most significant update is the menu ribbons, which are a pain to relearn, and the XML formatting, which remains to be seen if it will be useful in the Office environment. Since they are pushing SharePoint quite succesfully, I think this will pay off for MS in the long run, but otherwise, just be prepared to shell out some retraining dollars.

I bought this after reading about the 3rd party firmware
from SVEASOFT and other suppliers.

I have to disagree with this comment - 
&#62;This router is made by Cisco and for those of you who do not
&#62;know this is the brand networking that all of the major &#62;companies use. So basically Cisco makes Linksys products for
&#62;the standard home user but with the same quality as Cisco 
&#62;products.

I push the boundaries of what a 'standard home user' does.
Cisco has changed suppliers or specifications after acquiring Linksys, and I can definitely tell the difference in the details.  When comparing the BEFW11S4 (2001-vintage wireless/wired router) and the WRT54G, the ethernet  cables do not slip in and out as easily in the 54G, making it harder to work with from a pure mechanical perspective.

I bought this pedometer after admiring one a friend was using. It has a large digital display and is easy to set up and use.  The case has a great clip, which I fasten to the pocket of my jeans.  It also has a safety strap which can be used with or without the case.  The unit automatically resets itself to zero at 12:01 am and puts the previous day's steps into the (7-day) memory.  

I use the pedometer for walking and running.  It does not recognize the difference in stride when I'm running, so the mileage recorded is not accurate when I walk and run in the same day.  It also considers anything over 60 steps per minute to be aerobic.  

Altogether I am very pleased with this pedometer and would recommend it to anyone considering buying one.  I had another (cheap-o) one I never could figure out and it was flimsy and difficult to read.

This is the most simple and clean litter box I have ever bought! I tried so many different types (some were VERY expensive) but this one is simply the BEST! I left the old one out just in case my cat needs time to get use to the new one, but he used it right away and totally ignored the old one! It is very simple to use and no expensive parts to buy. I use "Scoop Away" (doesn't leak) and the sifter thoroughly cleans out the clumps so I now use less sand  and save money on sand! Since my cat's mess is contained in the pull-out drawer, you don't smell the poop! Make sure that the parts are put together properly (in my case, there was a little bit of plastic still stuck in the hole where the latches slides into so I cut it off so that the latch latches on more tight, and slides in more smoothly).  In my cat's case, he's a big 14 pound cat with big derriere, which leads to big clumps so I tilt the litterbox abit more then on its side to be sure the clumps falls into the pull out drawer (you can hear the clumps thump into the drawer). WOW, this thing is really really good and I recommend it to all cat owners who wants simple,clean, and economical litterbox!

Aside from taking three weeks to deliver from Amazon this product works fine.  Microsoft has added a .docx extension now instead of .doc and now forces you to buy the upgrade.  There is a workaround, but it is a bit of a pain.  Word and Excel look different but do the exact same thing the previous versions do.  If you do not have to upgrade and already have Office XP or Office 2003 there really is not much of a reason to purchase this now.

This is the best movie of 2008 and the best adaptation of a comic or graphic novel ever. Period!  The action and drama start right away and they never end.  The screenplay was excellent. The imagery and cinematography was exceptional, especially considering that this superhero, is mortal and there was little help from CGI.  

For the fans of Batman this movie will not only hold it's own but it will engage you and hold you right to the end.  I really does honor and improve upon anything Frank Miller intended for the Dark Knight.  For my wife, brother, friends and all the other non-believers the entire movie captivated them.

I don't believe in giving away the plot, there are enough reviewers that do that.  This movie deserved all of the hype and accolades it received and so does the late Heath Leger.  

This is a great movie for anyone who even remotely likes action, drama, psychological thrillers or even horror.  This is the only movie this year that I believe deserves a 5 star rating.

All in all we've done ok with ours, but after about 5 years, I was looking at a new fountain. After this long, it gets harder and harder to get this thing completely clean.  However, before we get a new one, I wanted to share the experience of our PetMate Fresh Flow ownership.

Pros:
* The boys (2 cats ages 4 and 11) drink more water with it than without
* It wasn't overly expensive to get
* Filters are, for the most part, reasonably priced
* Pretty quiet when it's running on a full bowl
* Has been running for almost 5 years straight
* Easy to disassemble/reassemble
Cons:
* Impossible to thoroughly clean the reservoir
* Lots other of nooks I can't get into to clean
* That means you have to clean it fairly often.
* Food bits, hair,and litter don't get pre-filtered
* Gets noisy when dirty or low on water
* Bowl and ramp quickly get grimy even after cleaning
* Filters can be hard to find
* Even when using filtered water, filters quickly get incredibly yucky
* We still constantly have cats trying to drink out of the faucets.
Notes:
* Even though you can operate many pet fountains without a filter if you're using filtered water at home, I don't recommend it with this one. We tried it for awhile and it was gross in a matter of days.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)

      



I have been a loyal user of Microsoft products made for the Mac, such as Word and Excel for several years, even before these programs were incorporated into the Office suite.  Every time a new version was released, I generally postponed upgrading for a few months due to the number of negative reviews posted by the early adopters and simply waited for the bugs to be fixed.  

Following the release of this 2008 version of Microsoft Office 2008 I again read a lot of complaints about various problems encountered by people who apparently can't wait to own the latest edition of any sort of product.  When I finally got around to purchasing the 2008 version myself I didn't encounter any problems with either the Word or the Excel programs, which are the only ones that I use on a day to day basis.  Sure there were some adjustments that I had to make due to some changes in the programs from their earlier versions, but once I had tweaked each program to my own requirements I found them both to be quite serviceable and I have yet to notice any of the problems that others had mentioned, such as not being able to utilize documents or spreadsheets generated by previous versions of the software or email recipients not being able to read some documents.

This product has an auto-update program built into it that will check online periodically to see whether there are any software updates or fixes that need to be obtained.  I have downloaded a couple of those on occasions although I had not experienced any problems in using the products prior to doing so.   I can only assume that the problems experienced by the early adopters have since been remedied through updates since the programs have worked fine for me.

Love this appliance.  It is simple and easy to operate.  I bought it specifically to make 'raw' ice cream.  The ice cream comes out beautifully in less than an hour.  I have a vitamix blender and was concerned when reading other's reviews about the noise level... from my perspective (having a loud appliance that I use a minimum of 2x a day) this ice cream maker is practically noise-free!  Some hints for using:

1) Make sure the bowl is frozen solid. We keep our stored in the freezer so it is always ready to go

2) Go for at least 45 minutes for a more 'ice cream' consistency... you can even go a little longer if needed.  At 30 minutes it is more like a soft-serve consistency (also good)

3) If you can chill your ingredients first it's even better

What a great way to get a healthy (depending on the ingredients you choose) treat!

I enjoyed this miniseries so much that I just had to buy it.  I have since shared it with the rest of my family, and the response is always the same: Amazing attention to detail, and captivating from start to finish.  It pulls you back in time, and you can almost imagine yourself back when our country was struggling to free itself from the yoke of England's Monarchy. It was such a turbulent time to live, when the peoples' desire to be independent could have led to charges of treason against the Crown, and their deaths by hanging. 

We are given insight to how the Congress was formed, and how it worked. The election of the President and Vice-President was quite interesting in how it was accomplished.... so much less complicated than what we have today! Politics in general hasn't changed much, though....

The producers have gone to great lengths to make the sets as close as possible to the actual places they are portraying. The actors have been transformed to what we today acccept as how these historical figures actually looked. If you want more detail, you can switch on the program that gives facts about the times, the people, the places, the customs, etc... as the movie plays. It is similar to what the miniseries "ROME" offered, and gives so much more information than from just watching the movie. There are also subtitles for those that need them.

The performances of Paul Giamatti, Laura Linney, Stephen Dillane, and the rest of the cast, are top notch. Without the chemistry they project on screen, it could have been just another mediocre historical movie.  But they bring these historical figures to life, making them unforgettable! 

I recommend this DVD set to anyone who loves history, or to anyone who wants to learn a little more of how our country was back in its infancy.
It is truly worth the price, which, I might add, Amazon.com beat every place else, hands down!

Do not pass go and go directly to the linksys site for the latest firmware update.  I spent hours trying to figure out why mixed mode would not work with my older 802.11b client cards.  Well, the standard out of the box version has some serious bugs that linksys corrected in a downloadable update however it took me many hours before I decided it wasn't me and there may be something wrong with the linksys.  After the update all was well.  Linksys should advise in there quick installation folder that you should check their site for updates immediately and make it really easy to update their software (updating required downloading to my pc, accessing the linksys through the web interface, finding the update key and locating where I downloaded the update.  This is not for the faint of heart).All is well now and all my computers that were running fine on an old cisco 802.11b ap are now running on my new linsys.

I love KitchenAid mixer.  I had the classic 4.5 quarts before and had a lot of fun with it.  Great for kneading, making scones, etc.  So, when I saw the 5 quart model on sale, I jumped at the chance to purchase it.  Same as before, but only bigger, right?  Well, it worked great until I realized that the dough was being left at the bottom of the bowl.  So, I figured it's because of the height so I lowered it a bit.  Now, keep in mind that nowhere in the booklet of instruction does it tell you how much the tolerance should be.  I went to their live help to get that number which is 1/16".  (Another advice:  Use paddle attachement for the height measurement.  Dough Hook will give you falst reading)  So, here I go with lower height setting.  I noticed that the top part would twitch everytime it kneaded the dough.  After making the dough, I found a ground up spot on the dough hook and scratch marks on the bowl.  I had to replace the dough hook but fortunately, the scratch on the bowl was minor enough.  So, once again, I'm trying to knead something.  I thought I heard some scratching noise again, so I raised the height about a half turn.  Next thing I know, I couldn't lock the head in because nothing was lining up anymore.  So, here's my recommendation:  Get KitchenAid for it's an awesome gadget to have.  But...  DO NOT TOUCH THE SETTING ONCE YOU BUY IT.  I put the paddle attachment and sorta got the 1/16", but it's not the same anymore...  That's a shame, though, for such a great tool.  I think I'll try to upgrade to the professional series where the setup is totally different and hopefully will have better luck.

this is my first epilator.  i am not very sensitive to pain, and i find it comfortable to use.  i recommend epilating once a week and exfoliating daily.  as i read in other reviews, the spotlight is very helpful and distinguishes this one from its competitors.   plus braun is a great, reliable brand; i've been happy with all of their products that i own, including this one.

Although I've read some anecdotal reports about people having early failures with the 1 Tb. Big Disk, I've been using it for nearly a months problem-free. It's quiet, it doesn't run conspicuously hot, and I appreciate its energy-saving mode. My only possible complaint: this "Big Disk" is actually two 500 Gb disks ganged together in a RAID 0 array which my computer "sees" only as a single disk. This would be a more flexible product if it were engineered in such a way that users had the option of running it in RAID 1 or JBOD configurations. NOTE: I bought this because I had a very sad experience with the Ethernet version of this product (the disk was fine, but the associated management/repair software is not, with the result that I have a very expensive paperweight since I can't repair a damaged directory). People considering buying that product should buy this one instead.

John Adams: deeply principaled, no-nonsence, ornery, lawful good, brilliant, fallible, passionate founder of our country.  This is the story of the unbridled defiance, the shrewd intellect, and the angry pounding fist that tore the American colonies from British rule and gave birth to one of the greatest experiments in the history of the world - the United States of America.  Stunning and haunting, this is John Adams like you've never seen him.  Myth and poetry have been stripped away to reveal the far-more-fascinating, truly-human story of one of the greatest men who has ever lived.

Giamatti is simply brilliant as Adams.  If he doesn't win the Emmy for this, I may declare my own independance from the "dark tyranny" of the ATAS.  Linney is equally wonderful in her portrayal as the groundingly sapient Abigail.  Their love story is one of the greatest in American history, and it's been marvelously recaptured here.

If it's even possible to have "spoilers" for a factual historical drama, then the following might qualify, but if you want to see what each eposide covers, here's my stab at it:

Episode 1: Join or Die.
Begins with the Boston Massacre, and covers the period leading up to Adams departure for Philidelphia to represent Massachusettes in the First Continental Congress.

Episode 2: Independance.
Covers the First Continental Congress, the beginning of the American Revolution at Lexington and Concord, the nomination of GW (by Adams) to serve as general of the new Continental Army, the Second Continental Congress, and Adams collaboration with Jefferson and Franklin to bring forth the Declaration of Independance.

Episode 3: Don't Tread on Me.
Covers the journey of Adams and Franklin to France to secure support against the British, Adam's tone-deaf approach to French diplomacy, his painful separation from Abigail, his dispatch to Holland (where his approach is somewhat better receive), and a terrible illness that befalls him.

Episode 4: Reunion.
Covers the defeat of the British forces, Adam's return to Paris and reunion with Abigail, his appointment to represent the new nation to the English crown, his frustrating absence from the Constitutional Convention, his return to America, and his election as Vice President.

Episode 5: Unite or Die.
Covers Adam's Vice Presidency under George Washington, the ongoing British and French conflict, his strained relationship with Jefferson over their very different ideas about how the new nation should be governed, and his narrow victory over Jefferson to become the second President.

Episode 6: Unnecessary War.
Covers Adam's uneasy presidency, including the retention of Washington's cabinet, largely controlled by Hamilton (mistake #1), the imfamous Alien and Sedition Acts (mistake #2), his arrival at the White House in the new capital of Washington (both still under construction), his estragement from his son Charles, the XYZ affair, his successful prevention of war with France, his loss of the Presidency to Jefferson, and his somber return to Massachusettes.

Episode 7: Peacefield.
Covers Adam's post-presidency, including the death of daugher Nabby, followed by Abigail, his reconciliation with Jefferson, the election of John Quincy as President, his long and introspective reflections on his life and legacy, and his death on the same day as Jefferson - the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration which they masterminded together.

I hope you enjoy this rare masterpiece as much as I did.  I watched every episode as they aired, and plan to watch them all again as soon as the DVD is available.  This is television at its finest, and I give it my highest recommendation.

I ordered this product Wednesday night and it came to me by Friday morning. It was the quickest shipment I've ever received. I had standard delivery and at wasn't too happy that it was not part of Amazon's $25 Free shipping policy but the fact that it arrived so fast made up for it.

This review is from: Iron Man [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)

      



Iron Man is without a doubt, Marvel's next hit franchise. You could say it's the new "Spider-Man" and boy, does this trilogy look promising with its first chapter.

How great is Iron Man? Well consider that I was still able to see it over one month since it's release date and it's still showing with multiple show times. Famed film critic Roger Ebert gave it a perfect four stars even. It could be this summer's top movie just as Transformers was 2007's.

Iron Man reminds me a lot of the first Spider-Man film in how the story is not terribly complex but dynamic enough with everything else solid. Robert Downey Jr. was born to play Tony Stark, a intelligent, B.A. businessman & engineer. Gwyneth Paltrow who plays Pepper Potts, Stark's secretary and love interest, is able to successfully act with Downey Jr. so that their two characters show authentic chemistry. Every character was perfectly cast in my opinion.

Industrial Light & Magic delivers again this summer with their work in Iron Man. Although it didn't blow me away like Transformers visuals did, the movie's effects were top notch quality and made the experience all the more enjoyable.
It seemed like an interesting, maybe even risky choice to have the musical score consist mainly of guitar-heavy, rock-like tracks but it turned out completely fitting with Tony Stark's personality and the mechanical brawn of Iron Man.

All I can say to finish this review is to go see Iron Man if you haven't. Do not miss out on one of the best summer blockbusters of 2008!

I've used it in and out of the shower and feel that it's easier to clean midway through a grooming project in the shower.  The sized guards are pointless, as the smallest number one is the only one that effectively trims curly body hair.  It takes a few swipes over the same area, but the trimming results are very good, with little to no irritation.  With the guard off, I was able to get a pretty close shave with no irritation.  That was a huge plus for me.  The ergonomics are excellent and the ability to use it in the shower distinguishes it from the rest.  I highly recommend this product.

I've been a science fiction buff for years. If it has been a major TV series, I've seen every episode. All the Star Treks, Babylon 5, Stargate SG-1, Dr. Who, etc. In all honesty, I was a bit skeptical of this series. But after watching the mini-series a few years ago, I was hooked. I now own all the DVDs and am anxiously awaiting Season 3. This series rocks! Excellent acting, great special effects - it seems real and believeable. Character development and human drama are well done. The Cylons make perfect villans - are they heartless machines or sentient beings who have evolved above man? Edward Almos as Commander/Admiral Addama and Mary McDonnel as the Colonial President are awesome actors. They make this show.  Season 2.5 has some excellent action and drama. Adding the Pegasus to the fleet was a great idea. And Starbuck is starting to mature as a character and actor. Get me a viper and I'll join the fleet!

Recorder my first horse race on July 4th using my new Flip recorder. I was pleasantly surprised on the qualiity of the audio and the picture. The picture was a little grainy in the back stretch of the race, however the front stretch was absolutely fabulous. The only draw back I could even think of is the video screen. While recording a race for example in the sunlight you can't see the image in the screen. You have to have the "point and hope" theory that the horse or image you are recording is in the picture. One other issue that customers have to be aware of is it is not compatible with all computers. You need to be sure you have compatible or the latest and greatest "Windows". I would say that the method of connecting to TV is easy and provides a good crisp picture. Now I want you all to remember that I am recording a horse race on a half mile track!! Amazing sound and picture............but one!!!

This has got to be the best toaster oven I have ever owned or used!  Here are some things I was concerned about after reading the reviews before I bought it:

- Some people complain about burning themselves on the metal strip behind the handle.  This is probably only an issue if you have large hands.  Not even our kids have done this yet.

- I love the convection feature. It is a little bit noisy, though not 'rattly' like I had feared.  If you want quiet, just don't use that feature.

- Some people complained about how long it took to make toast.  I found it took about the same amount of time I'm used to a toaster oven taking (I've been using them since the 1980's!).  It may seem longer because you actually see the time.

- Some people complained the toast wasn't dark enough.  I like my toast on 4 or 5.  My husband likes it REALLY dark, so he sets it on 7 (the highest) and uses the '4-6 slice' and 'bagel' buttons to extend the time, and that's plenty dark for him.

- I thought the rewarm toast feature sounded silly, but I actually find it very helpful and use it all the time.

- I laughed at people saying a light would be useful.  Since when does a toaster oven need a light?  Well, this one is soooo large it actually could use one.  Go figure!  This toaster oven is so large I can roast a regular chicken, some baked potatoes, AND a small casserole AT THE SAME TIME.  I'm not joking!  This is the largest toaster oven I think I've EVER seen, much less used.  It is THREE times larger than my last one, yet takes up just about the same amount of counter space.

This truly is an amazing appliance.  I probably could get rid of my oven now that I have this - and I cook for my family of four.  I did my research before buying, but was still a little nervous about the price tag.  It is totally worth every penny.  I have not regretted a thing and love my Cuisinart toaster oven.

The trailer for this film was a spectacular Busby Berkeley-style musical number that looked mighty fun, but has little to do with the final film. Personally, I thought this film was going to be a turkey, but it turned out to be a very well-done and fun family film.

Here's the story: Vivian (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a wealthy Beverly Hills businesswoman who practically worships Chloe (voice of Drew Barrymore), her chihuahua, dressing it in designer outfits and giving it an over-the-top real diamond collar. When Chloe has to go out of town, her flakey niece Rachel (Piper Perabo) is left in charge. Rachel goes south of the border to Mexico to party with her friends and Chloe gets dog-napped while there. Chloe is rescued from the Mexico City dog fights by a German Shephard, Delgado (voiced by Andy Garcia), who becomes her "bodyguard." The dognappers learn of Chloe's/Vivian's wealth and they want her back at all costs. Rachel also desperately wants Chloe back and teams up with Viv's landscaper handsome Sam (Manolo Cardona). Predictably, the journey is about Chloe losing her Beverly Hills snobbery (and Chanel No. 5 scent) and Rachel maturing; this helps pave the way for Chloe and Rachel to find true love with mates they would have previously not thought worthy. Sam's chihuahua Pap?(voice of George Lopez) pursues Chloe during the entire movie and helps Sam & Rachel find her. Naturally, the motivation of the movie is to find and return Chloe before Viv returns from her trip.

Is the plot predictable? Sure...but boy is it fun to watch. Barrymore, Garcia, and Lopez have great chemistry, and the special effects/stunt work for the dogs is amazing. You actually believe they are talking after awhile, it's that good. There are a few semi-scary scenes that the younger ones might be a little freaked by, but nothing having an adult nearby wouldn't take care of. Although a dialogue-driven film, the lively music and some of the sound effects will give your speakers a more than ample workout.

DVD & Blu-ray Extras:

* Legend of the Chihuahua: An all-new animated short that is very fun; very reminiscent of the Disney classic cartoon "Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom" in its style and storytelling.

* Blooper Scooper: Blooper reel that shows a little of the difficulty in getting the dogs to do what they were supposed to do.

* 3 Deleted scenes with intros by Director Raja Gosnell: These are fun, but not essential to the plot and were wisely removed. They are shown at various stages of development, as the animation (for the dogs to speak) is missing in many of these. Scenes are:
1. Chihuahua Nation
2. Chloe's Vision Quest (would have really dragged the plot down)
3. Mi Coraz髇: Chloe and Papi's Duet

* Audio commentary (widescreen version only) by Director Raja Gosnell. Interestingly enough, Gosnell had the voice talent dub together, so that ad-libbing could be used and that they could play off each other. It works, as the chemistry in this film between the dogs really is apparent.

Blu-ray Exclusive Extras:

* Pet Pals: The Voices Behind the Dogs
* Hitting the Bark: On set with the dogs of "Beverly Hills Chihuahua"
* Additional deleted scenes
* BD-Live (US Only)

Specs:
Audio-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, French & Spanish Language Tracks (Dolby Digital 2.0), French & Spanish Subtitles * Video: Widescreen (2.40:1) or Full Screen (1.33:1)

I purchased the standard DrinkWell (not the Platinum) and set it up a couple of months ago.  I have two cats.  Neither cat went near it for a couple of days, although I had the water flow turned to its lowest (which reduces the noise).  But then one of them ventured over, and now she loves it. This is great because I had a lot of trouble getting her to drink enough water, which led to gross health problems I won't describe here -- but cost me $1200 in vet bills!  The other cat (who has always been abnormally timid) is comfortable with being around it, but I still haven't seen him actually drink from it.  I'm pleased with the product except for one complaint:  it is REALLY REALLY HARD to get the freaking pump out to clean the machine (which must be done at least weekly). Every time, I have to really wrestle and pull and pry to get the thing out -- it's just a matter of time before I break the fountain, trying to get the pump out.  I don't know if the Platinum version is easier to clean, haven't seen the insides of one yet.  Other than that, I'm glad to have it, and when/if I break it, I'll purchase another one.  Sure beats paying $1200 to the vet!

I am the only coffee drinker in the house, and I only drink coffee at breakfast.  This product fits my needs perfectly.  However, I learned to use #2 paper cone filters instead of the supplied filter.  Otherwise, you get a dose of grounds if you drain the last drop.  Also, I measured the provided metal cup, and was able to find like-size large regular coffee mugs to use instead.  That's very helpful if the mug from yesterday is still inside the dishwasher.

I was skeptical of buying an inexpensive hub because I've heard from others that they're usually made very cheaply in China, either by prisoners or giant pandas, and they tend to overheat and burn out.

Finally a pedometer that is accurate!  I read a lot of reviews and did lots of research and after being bummed about my 2 previous choices the Omron HJ-112 is awesome.  Its easy to use, stores a week worth of stuff and is always extremely close to always being accurate (I say close because it is sometimes off by a few steps)  Overall this is by far the best of the bunch.  I will be getting a few more as gifts.  I highly recommend this one. I checked out the newer version that is computer compatible but it doesn't work with a mac and was way more money.

I've been a Mac user for over 7 years and am on my fourth computer, and by far, this one is my favorite!

This MacBook Pro is the most balanced one they've come out with, and it has all of the most up-to-date features including these key ones:

1. Runs cooler than my friends' previous version MBP
2. Mulit-touch is nice but I don't use it a lot
3. Upgraded iSight camera makes for great video chatting and works perfectly with many other programs. I use it almost daily for video journaling
4. LED screen isn't "new" for this model, but it is a great feature that makes the screen look wonderful
5. More storage on the entry-level model than before

All in all, I'm very satisfied with this computer and would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid laptop that has speed but isn't huge. Also, the size difference compared to the MacBook is minimal in my opinion. Sometimes this actually seems smaller given the sleeker design. 

Of course, the only drawback is the price, but over the life of the computer, I think it will be well worth it. Finally, it is a Mac and it has the best operating system available (Mac OS 10.5) whether you're a newbie or computer aficionado!

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS

This book actually left me with the kind of feeling that I hoped for out of the other three books.
 The pulling together of so many disparate characters, to save an innocent, whether or not they had any familial connection to the accused, is of more import than whether or not they actually had to lay down their lives to guard that life.
 It is the willingness to stand as a witness in the face of certain death (and in this case dismemberment) that is the important feature of the book. 
 That is the heart of the book,for me at least.
 I compare it to real life and find that it is compatible. 
 To think that each time that we are willing to sacrifice any part of ourselves for another, and when we, in the end, do not have to do so, is some sort of failure is just...well naive. And disturbing.
 
Note: If the finally-married-and-in-love scene is too much for you to handle, then by all means go find another book.

I owned the first generation Slingbox and really liked that but decided to upgrade as I was having a lot of problems with the non-standard input cables that it used. Since I have a high-def Tivo, the Solo seemed the obvious choice. 

The Slingbox player that you use on your computer or laptop to watch shows keeps getting better and I've been very impressed by the quality versus the old Slingbox I had. It's neat how the remote actually *looks* like my Tivo remote, and also the player can be customized with your most often-used commands so that you can still forward-back-replay-etc. without having to bring up the full remote view. Installation was a piece of cake and I had no problem at all hooking my other devices up to its output. 

One thing to be aware of is that this is *not* a wireless device and you will need to hook it up directly to your network via ethernet cable. If this is not feasible, you can use an ethernet bridge (will need an available wall outlet at both ends) but be sure to add this to the price when determining cost. Also, while Slingbox does make a mobile player which works nicely on smartphones, Palms, PocketPCs, etc. they do charge extra for it. Considering the whole point of this device is to watch TV away from home, it seems that the mobile player ought to be free. Having said that, the player does work pretty well for the most part, if you have 3G or a fast Wifi connection, depending on your device and how well it handles video playback. They do have a trial period with the mobile player so at least you can try before you buy. 

The biggest issue I've had so far is simply getting a good enough connection for it to stream the video without jumps or pauses. It works great at home, if for instance I want to watch a TV show from my computer room. But on the road I often find it's not that easy to always find a broadband connection that can handle enough throughput to really give you a good stream and often get pauses and sound loss while watching. It can be very frustrating. So I do have mixed feelings about this device. It's really, really cool, and will certainly impress friends and family. The device itself works great, and other than not supporting Wifi and including the mobile player, I don't have any complaints about it. I just wish I had more luck when I was using it to feel like it was worth the cost.

This is a sturdy, durable product. We use it mostly for kneading dough and it works very well. Easy to use and easy to clean. A bit too heavy for moving around- but its something that goes as a side effect of durability. Our last stand mixer was destroyed (motor burnt out) because it was cheap plastic frame and couldnt handle dough mixing. This one does 8 cups easily..

Have lots of applications loaded. Installed all applications to the D drive. For application that are used rarely I keep in a virtual machine on USB portable HDD. Application to keep things clean, like Ccleaner, Regseeker or Auslogic BoostSpeed keep the trash from accumulating. I use an external monitor and keyboard at home. The 1.6 Ghz Atom processor is impressive, display is excellent. I have nothing negative to say, would buy another, no questions asked. Thanks go to ASUS for a excellent product.

The Furminator arrived last night. My cats are already in love with it! So am I. Handfuls of fur came off, filling a huge bag. The cats couldn't get enough, my only problem was getting them to stand still. They kept walking back and forth, "get this part, now THIS part!". We are in a major heatwave and they look so much more comfortable. Their coats are all silky and smooth. The handle made it easy to use. I will have to hide it so they don't try to use it themselves. A+ to the inventor!

We got this gate plus two extensions, one for either side, almost a month ago for our triplets who just turned a year old. We were concerned at first if the extra extensions would be able to support the three babies sufficiently. It does! The only downfall, which I've seen mentioned a few times before, is that the available width space doesn't match up with what the gate says it can support. So if you get this and are running to the border of width, add that extra extension for sure so it's not wobbling. And after measuring and you think using the gate with both extentions will just barely fit, try it, but more than likely it will be wobbly a bit. Just keep that in mind. Otherwise, this is a great gate! We have the added baseboards along the bottom of our walls plus the tiny toe boards and because this is all pressure mounted it adjusts great. Just take your time and get things even and straight. It doesn't take long to set up, 15-20 minutes tops. It works great for us since we live in military base housing and want to avoid putting holes in the walls to fill in later. It's odd at first to get used to the foot petal but once you get used to it, it's a lifesaver! We have the Clear View Gate on the playroom which we love but for the kitchen doorway we needed something wider and more convenient with the smaller swing door since we use the kitchen more. The bar on the bottom took only a couple days to get used to and with the ramps on either side it helps with not tripping. The gate swings either way which helps too! Sooo worth the money since these things can be used for years!

I am not sure why everyone is writing bad reviews because of their installation problems and problems with the software.  My disc was fine and installed normally and quickly.  

As for the application its self, it takes about 10 minutes to get used to your voice, but after that, the program recognized almost all of the words that I dictated in a relatively fast pace.  The only words it did get wrong was end in stead of and, which was probably my fault because of my pronunciation.

Overall this is a great product, and I would recommend it to any student, who is just an ok typer, but needs to write a lot on the computer.

This product is everything I expected and more. I am a college student and within just a few hours of having this netbook I wrote three papers and did a powerpoint presentation on this thing. It's perfect for surfing the internet, even though the type is a little small. You can always make it larger though. The screen is so clear and great for watching videos and movies online. Having three USB ports is a total plus, not to mention how simple it is to expand your hard drive (by inserting an SD card - That's it!). So all in all, whether you're traveling or just surfing online, this little computer is fantastic and great for the price. And the 6-cell battery lasts about 5 hours when fully charged. Great for being out all day without a power cord.
Great netbook, great price. I just love it.

I totally love the new iPod Classic! It works super well, no lag, scrolling through the cover art works perfectly. Pretty easy to navigate although finding shuffle for an album or artist was a bit confusing with it being under settings. It looks super SEXY!

The Zune is overall a great product and I would recommend it to anyone. This review makes some comparisons to the iPod Classic because many are familiar with the iPod Classic and are debating between these two often.

Positives for the Zune:
- Sound Quality exceeds that of the Classic, while the classic is good it has too much focus on the low end and really isn't all that great in the mids. The Zune has great balance meaning it plays low/mids/highs exceptionally well, matching the 5th gen iPod in my opinion. [Tested with Bose Around The Ear Headphones, won't be noticed much with cheap/stock ear buds]
- Interface is wild and more modern than other MP3 players. You'll feel like you are in 2008 with the device's interface. You can also customize it, while customization is limited to changing the wallpaper its still something not many other players have. [including the classic]
- The large screen is nice for video..I haven't ran into any pixelation problems that some people report with the resolution of 320 x 240 on that size of the screen..however your mileage may vary. The screen is much better suited than the dinky 2.5 screen that is on the Classic.
- Navigation with the Zune pad is a breeze and better than the Classic. A few reasons being that a) you can press the buttons to adjust volume in your pocket [the classic relies on luck that you can actually get the touch sensitive wheel to respond through your pants], b) the zune pad sticks out from the unit which makes it easier to feel for than the classic which the click wheel is pretty well flush with the unit itself, c) you can navigate with pin point navigation, use the touch function to scroll fast and the click function to get precise.
- Microsoft continues to make improvements to the product like the Zune 3.0 release that adds the FM Radio feature that allows you to add music off the radio to your cart or with wireless download the song directly to your Zune. Clock is introduced [a feature that was lacking that people constantly complained about, MICROSOFT LISTENS!], and the Wifi Marketplace is also introduced which allows you to browse the marketplace wirelessly as well as preview/download songs instantly if you have a Zunepass.
- The software on the PC looks very modern..where as iTunes has virtually remained the same since its release on the PC. The software has the ability to combine albums with a simple drag n drop which allows you to combine singles into their full featured albums with a simple click. Getting Album art is easy as well as track listings for a album if you are missing tag information..if you are missing tag information and the software can't find it, it will give you a drop down list of all albums on the CD and allow you to choose which track is the right one..none listed? No problem you can keep it its current track name. Manual Sync is NOW supported officially, meaning the device can run independently of your Zune Collection. The software can actually work with a external drive, when I tried with iTunes 7.6 it would close by itself. Mixview is nice, you can simply right click a album click mixview to get a view of several related artists to find new music with.

Neutral:
- Zune Pass, almost all the music on the Marketplace supports it..some might be annoyed with the fact you have to pay $15 a month forever unless you want to lose your songs, some might also have a problem with not owning the music or that some songs aren't available for the Zune Pass. I personally think its a great concept and I have absolutely no complaints about paying $15 for all the songs I can download.
- Smudges and scratches might be a problem for some if you are really picky the new gloss front is prone to scratches from metal objects [keys, coins, etc.].
- Its made of plastic which could be taken either a) a good thing because its lighter b) a bad thing because its obviously not as tough.

Negatives:
- Software is still behind when compared to iTunes but improves with every update. Some complaints include, Rating system is a "Like, Don't Like" System giving you very limited options when you find songs that aren't GREAT but are OK..you either have to hate it or like it. If you are in a certain spot in your collection and click Marketplace then go back your spot is lost and Zune software returns to the top of your list. The same happens when you are at a certain spot in the marketplace as well, you leave and you end up reseting the marketplace back to home.
- Marketplace layout is very generic and needs some serious tweaking where as the iTunes Store is very precise the layout of the Marketplace is just sloppy, there really isn't much browsing you can do unless the artist is new because when you browse through artists in a specific genre they aren't in alphabetic order they are just scattered about I assume by popularity.
- Premium Earbuds are gone replaced with generic earbuds.


Overall a great alternative to the now dying Classic [which didn't get any upgrades beyond battery and the genius feature..unless you consider the 120GB a upgrade from the 80GB model last year]. I do not regret my purchase and would recommend it to anyone.

I've had the keyboard for 2 weeks now, so I can't comment on durability. As others have said, the keys are very soft to the touch and it is very quiet when typing. The lighting on it is excellent, both for low-light and normal conditions. The keyboard is also very sturdy with heavy grip pads on the bottom.

Overall, I would say it's money very well spent for an excellent keyboard. For gamers who are used to low-light conditions and want the best of the best, this keyboard will suit you nicely.

I'm into my 3rd machine after buying my first in 1995.  I use it daily.  It eventually needs replacing because the pan loses its non-stick quality and it's very tough to get the loaf out.  I just wish Panasonic would make it easy and cost-effective to replace the pan rather than buy a new machine.

It makes perfect bread.  I don't bother with weighing the ingredients as the book suggests - just throw in three and a half cups of flour, a teaspoon of salt, dessertspoon of sugar, a tablespoon of oil or a chunk of butter, 12 oz of water, and then one and a half teaspoons of yeast in the dispenser and you're done.  

Friends and family members have bought other brands, and eventually thrown them away to replace with the Panasonic after seeing the results from mine.  I couldn't live without it!

CHANGELING

I went into this film for only one reason and it had nothing to do with Clint Eastwood, Ron Howard, or Angelina Jolie. I watched this for Jeffrey Donovan since I am a huge fan of his especially his show with Bruce Campbell "Burn Notice", possibly the best show on today. So I was excited to learn that he was in this and had a major role in it as well. Still with that a side every one involved with this film did an excellent job on this film, including to my surprise Jolie. I know that sounds bad but it really isn't but there will be more on that later, really there will be.

I am sure that every one knows that this is a true story film based on some events that happened called the Wineville murders. The film is based on the man who did these things kidnapping and murdering little kids with his nephew in tow, that part is crazy. Any way along the way they take a boy named Walter Collins and naturally his mother goes crazy looking for him. After months of what I can only imagine as some of the worst pain possible his mother gets the news that her son has been found. When brought to the train station to reunite with him she is astonished when the kid turns out not to be hers, of course the LAPD disagrees with every word. From here the film is a chess match between Mama Collins and the police department, and it is one for the ages. When she refuses to believe that the child brought to her is her son the police with a snap of their fingers put her away in a mental hospital. I assure you that it only gets better from their, I promise. 

I have to say that J. Michael Straczynski did a wonderful job adapting the real story into a screenplay that ended up being a brilliant film. I know that it is hard to add all those words and events together especially when you were not there at all. Still I feel that this is very close to what happened and that is saying something. Same can be said for Director Clint Eastwood who once again creates another marvelous picture that got snubbed at the Oscars. This man keeps amazing me with the quality of the films he puts out, I can honestly say that I have enjoyed all of his films when he is behind the camera. You can tell the man has been in the business for a while because he knows how to tell a story. Two more guys that scored again are producers Brian Grazer and Ron Howard who once again were apart of one of the best films of the year, they are known to do that from time to time. Sure most of there films end all happy and stuff but you have to admit that the films have been entertaining. While the director had a lot to do with making this a good movie a lot of credit needs to go to the DP Tom Stern who made this film look fantastic. With these people behind this film how could it not be good, the look and feel of this film is amazing. 

Acting wise this is a brilliant film and that includes the child actors, that is a rarity even on big budget flicks. Donovan naturally is excellent as Captain Jones of the LAPD, his smug portrayal of the real life man is superb. This is now the fourth or fifth film I have seen him in and like all of the others h gives an excellent performance. Jolie is amazing as well and really changed my mind about her, don't get me wrong I never really hated her but she just seemed like she could only pull off less demanding roles. But I am happy to admit that she did a wonderful job in the lead role and pulled off some very tense moments. John Malkovich as one would expect provides one of the films best performances as the overly paranoid [it seem for good reason] preacher who comes to the aid of Miss Walters. Jason Butler Harner provides maybe the best performance next to Donovan as the murderess Gordon Northcott. He pulls off a crazy performance here and his execution scene is unforgettable in my mind. Some have said that he plays it over the top but I really feel like he did a wonderful job with a difficult character.

This was a wonderful film that I think was snubbed by the Academy but what ever, this film is great with out them. I recommend this flick to any and every one that enjoys a good movie. Normally I would say something like this may not be for every body but this time I will say, every body go get this. Everyone in this film and every one that worked on it should be proud, a marvelous piece of film making based on real events.

Our family recently introduced a new member to its flock.  Not long after his birth, I was given a Flip Video Ultra Series Camcorder.  We have another camcorder that we use that stores video on discs, and I use it as my primary "documentary" log, but this little gem is great for spur-of-the-moment happenings.  You never know when an infant is going to do something cute, and there isn't always time to load a disc into the camera.  That's why I love this Flip so much.

It's tiny (about the size of a disposable camera but much more slender), very simple to use and holds sixty minutes of video.  There's no extra equipment to lug around except for batteries (unless you opt for a tripod) and just about anybody can record with it.  Setting the time and date is simple enough, and downloading the video to your computer is a cinch.  The battery life is pretty good as well.  

To record, simply aim at whatever you wish to capture and press the big red button.  From there you can zoom in and out and even use it for still shots.  After you're finished you can watch the video on the camera, download it to your computer or connect the camera directly to your TV and watch the video there.  

I highly recommend this convenient camcorder to anybody who enjoys capturing moments that are hard to capture with a normal camcorder.  It's highly portable and simple to use.

I ordered this scale to track the weight of my 3 cats. Two of them have health issues that require close monitoring of weight. I was very pleased with how quickly I received the scale. The cats don't seem to mind being set on it at all. I really like the "hold" feature as it helps when you need to write the weight down and the cat has walked off figuring you're done. Having the added capability to use this scale for shipping will also come in handy. Overall, a great product at a reasonable price.

I purchased the WGR614 along with a Netgear WG511 54 Mbps wireless PC Card from Amazon. I use it to connect from my High Speed 2-Way DirecWay Satellite connection wirelessly to my Dell 8000 and Dell 8200 laptops, and my old Gateway desktop in my home. I purchased it primarily because I was told that some other 54 Mbps brands did not allow both b and g cards to be accessed at the same time on the same system. I installed the new g card on my 8200 with no problems at all but then when the entire system was up after about an hour I found that when using the g card on either of the laptops the other with a b card would not work. After a great deal of help from tech support we found that there is a conflict between the DirecWay DW6000 and the router. Both are addressed by http://192.168.0.1. We solved this by changing the address code for the router to 10.0.0.1 and BINGO everything was perfect. I highly recommend these products and the NETGEAR tech support system. They are the best money can buy at this time. I also found Amazon's service very good and responsive, and besides, they offered the lowest price (after rebates) I could find on the Web.

I completely love the Drinkwell Platinum.  The cats took to it immediately, and the consistent hydration is wonderful for them.  The fountain is especially wonderful for when I'm away from home for a day or two.

A couple of tips:

1.  Cleaning it by hand is a pain.  If you don't have a dishwasher, you may want to look for an alternative.  If you do have a dishwasher, note that the disassembled pieces are large and somewhat tricky to fit into the dishwasher due to their irregular shapes.  I have to remove the dishwasher's cutlery basket to get all the Drinkwell pieces in, and once they're in, there's not much space left for anything else.

2.  Keep a close eye on the prefilter.  I've noticed that it can cause the water to overflow the bowl if it gets clogged with cat hair.  Check it regularly to keep this from happening.

3.  I have my Drinkwell on a hardwood floor.  To deal with splashes (one of my cats likes to dip her paw into the bowl and lick the water off), I bought a large, plain aluminum sheet pan and put some self-adhesive plastic bumpers on the bottom to keep it from sliding, then set the Drinkwell in the sheet pan on the floor.  This protects the hardwood and makes it easier for me to pick up the Drinkwell to disassemble it for washing - I just pick up the sheet pan.

4.  Don't forget to pull the flow control lever off the pump to clean any cat hair out of the pump.  If you don't do this, the pump gets clogged and doesn't work as well.

I love knowing that the cats always have plenty of fresh water to drink!

I have used a Braun shaver for several years now and have liked it much better than any other electric shaver I have tried. I recently got the new Braun Pulsonic for Xmas. It is absolutely the best shaver ever. It gives me the smoothest/closest shave with zero razor burn. It shaves faster and quieter than even my older Braun. The automatic cleaning and charging is simple. I recommend the Pulsonic for anyone that wants the best shave possible.

Since the Grandparents and GreatGrandparents live far from us, they can still see the kids.... It's way easy to use.  So little and compact!  The family loves getting the clips of the kids on a daily basis!  I couldn't do it with out the flip video cam!!!  It's just too easy!

Batman Begins was a delightful breath of fresh air filling the sails of what one could have only hoped would be the beginning of a new era of Batman movies. Tim Burton's two films Batman and Batman Returns were very entertaining. Joel Schumacher's Batman Forever was fair at best, and Schumacher's Batman and Robin was absolutely atrocious (think the TV series).

The Dark Knight is so head and shoulders above what Burton did that it makes the Schumacher movies look like a bad 60s TV show. The Dark Knight even outdoes Batman Begins, and that's saying a lot!

Just as the title of Batman Begins was the best description of that movie, so is the title The Dark Knight for this one. In Batman Begins we saw exactly why and how Batman became Batman. In The Dark Knight we see a superhero with a seriously darker personality than his alter ego Bruce Wayne. And the Dark Knight must battle with some seriously dark, conflicting moral issues as well as dealing with a seriously dark villain. 

Heath Ledger will get big awards for his portrayal of The Joker...mark my words. And not because he died and to honor him. No. He'll get awards because every aspect of the role was delivered perfectly. Creepy. Genius. Crazy. Brilliant. From his vocal inflictions to that eerie way he kept licking his scars when he talked. Ledger will be sorely missed going forward.

Both Christian Bale and Heath Ledger make you believe that Batman and The Joker are real. The rest of the cast is perfect too. All of the familiar faces are back from Batman Begins with the exception of Katie Holmes (replaced quite un-noticeably by Maggie Gyllenhaal...and I meant that as kind of a back-handed compliment).

The special effects, cool devices and toys are back too...including an updated Tumbler (in keeping with Batman Begins, out are the stupid nicknames Batmobile, Batcycle, Batcave, Bat-etcetera). 

The Dark Knight is suspenseful, scary at times, very emotional at times and most importantly well-acted. The entire cast took their roles very serious and it made the movie that much more believable, real and...well...just awesome. This movie is a classic and I will watch it again and again on Blu Ray.

I have 2 cats and I am very happy with this litter box.  I bought this box to replace an automatic one.  I love that it has all reusable parts and there's no electricity involved.  I had a few extra minutes getting ready for work this morning, and that is all the time it took me to clean the box and dispose of the waste. Plus, I didn't get my hands dirty!  I would very highly recommend this product.

I am nutty for this show. I can't remember being this crazy about a show in years. I've been hooked since the first episode. Then read all the books in 2 weeks. I watch the reruns everynight.

The product works fine but the installation process could use some serious improvement.  Best as I can tell, if you want to change something, you have to start at the beginning.  For instance, I first tried WPA2 following the direction for keys.  However, Windows Vista didn't like the key length.  So, I started over and gave it a new key.

Then I learned that XP doesn't like WPA2.  So, I used WPA -- again having to start over.

Allegedly there's some web interface.  I tried that but ran into problems.  There was an obscure error, that I forget.  (I didn't realize there'd be a "test" (this review) or I'd have taken better notes).

Anyway, once it's installed, the router works fine.

I purchased this drive to replace the smaller drive that I bought with a larger laptop.  It seems that between the size of Windows Vista and being able to save more data on the primary drive, I was pushing the limits of Retrospect.  With only the 300Gb drive, Retrospect would sometimes fail to groom enough from the old backups to make space for a new full backup.  This 500Gb drive solved that problem.  

As mentioned elsewhere, the drive does run hot.  Just in case this might affect the life expectancy of the drive, I try to remember to remove the drive from the PC during the day, and reconnect in the evening before the overnight backup.  And, as already noted, the drive does need to be formatted before first use, but I was expecting that.

This is the best litter box - EVER!  I found that after I roll it onto its top, I give it a couple of firm whacks to loosen anything that has stuck to the sides, roll it back to the left, shake it a bit, empty the drawer, and voile - a fresh, clean litter box!  Quick and easy.  Can clean a box in less than a minute.

I was the only late-20's pregnant woman in the bookstore waiting anxiously for the clock to tick midnight the morning they released the fourth book in the series. I wasn't dressed in black capes or white make-up but I was surely just as excited as those teenie boppers in the store! I bought the first three in europe and had all three read in the next 5 days. The characters in this book are so lovable and believable that you can't help feeling deeply about them and making a real emotional connection to them! The second book was so heartbreaking for me but once I read the whole series I understood the reason Stephanie Meyer had to write it that way. I am left begging for more after the fourth, please Ms. Meyer, dazzle us again!

This review is for the Acer Aspire One, AOA 150-1784, with 160GB hard drive, 6-cell battery, 1.6 Ghz Atom processor with 1GB of RAM, mouse and Windows XP pre-installed.

Pros: Fantastic monitor, plenty of ram, 160GB of storage, great webcam, 3 USB ports, great wifi connectivity.

Cons: The touch pad is not so good.  Fingerprint magnet.

The bottom line is, for $329 this is an unbelievable value.  I wholeheartedly recommend this product.

The Pros:
Although not a substitute for a larger office PC or a full featured (and much larger) laptop, it has a fantastic looking monitor, plenty of RAM for running MS Office applications, surfing the web, and lots of storage for music, pictures and videos.  I am very impressed with the display.  Graphic are very clear.  It also has 3 USB ports, a VGA port, an SD card slot, and a Multi-in-one card reader.  WLAN connectivity is fantastic.  Connectivity is surprisingly strong and fast.  I was up and connected to the internet in a matter of minutes.  The web cam works really well.

The Cons:
First of all, let me say that I have no real complaints!  I am more than pleased!  This netbook is perfect for someone who travels and doesn't want to carry around a laptop the size of an aircraft carrier.  This netbook is less than half the size of my Toshiba laptop and does everything I need a travel computer to do!  It is so small in fact, that my wife can put it in her purse!  That said, there are a few things that take getting used to.  The graphics card is limited and I don't like the position of the buttons on the touch pad, but the mouse that came with it fixed that problem, although I will probably buy a wireless mouse to replace it.  It comes with Windows XP Home and takes a little time to set up.  The small amount of bloatware was easy to remove.  I even got rid of the 60-day trial edition of MS Office Home & Student.  I was going to get rid of Microsoft Works as well and install Open Office but realized that, on the road at least, I won't be doing complex spread sheets, or writing your latest novel.  I probably won't do anything more complicated than what can be handled by Works.  Besides, I bought this thing to do e-mail, surf the web, and store the pictures I take on vacation.

I chose this one because it comes with a 160GB hard drive and a 6-cell battery that Acer claims will last 5.5 hours, and I believe it.  I've been working on it now for over 4.5 hours straight, running multiple applications, and the meter says it has a 35% charge remaining.  I'm finding hard to put this thing down.  It seems to be sturdy, well made and strong enough to last for awhile, or at least until something better comes along.  This laptop has surpassed all of my expectations.  The price and performance put it well above anything else out there.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone with portable internet, or general computing needs.

From the title of this review your probably thinking that I'm refering to the 2nd coming of Battlestar Galactica when in fact I'm refering to the fact that this is the best sci-fi space show since Firefly. Where Firefly failed, BG is succeding in drawing in a loyal and huge fan base. The ratings really couldn't get any better. And when you watch the mini-series that started it all which is included in this set, you to will know why this has become the Sci-Fi channels biggest draw. You'll be hooked on the characters and there own stories as they struggle to survive the fall out of a war they never knew they where in and a war that has left them struggling to find salvation.

Taking it's basis from the original, this show has quickly come into it's own, and has made it's self one of the best dramas on TV. Not just a sci-fi show but a real adult drama dealing with real life issues and dilemas that we still face today. Some people may just see the name and put it off thinking it's just another 'space show' when in fact they'll be missing out on what some are calling the best show on TV. I became a believer shortly after purchasing this set, you will too because once your done you will want to go out and buy the next one, believe me when I say this.

This show is that good. There's a reason why this show is getting it's own spin-off prequel series, there's a reason why Sci-Fi picked it up so quicky, there are reasons why the makers are in talks for a feature length film. This show IS that good.

I just replaced my semi-dysfunctional WRT54G Linksys router (2nd in a row) with this router, and I couldn't be happier.   I've had several problems with the Linksys, and this router solved them all.  

The web interface is easy to use, packed with features (such as auto-populating MAC address for assigning to a static IP on a LAN, support for DMZ, port forwarding, etc). The range is great - I previously needed extra antennae for Linksys to reach my living room, but this router reaches it just fine, with full strenght on my MacBook Pro.

If you need a powerful yet simple to use router - this one is great.

Highly recommended!

PAIN:

The product description is very misleading. Using this is by no means 'painless' nor does it feel like a 'massage' where the rolllers 'glide over the skin'. Don't be gullible, ripping out hair from the roots cannot be such a pleasant and relaxing experience.

The level of pain depends on where you're using this.. I had no problem doing the lower half of my legs/arms; the upper halves hurt a little more; underarms hurt quite a bit depending on how taut my skin was (tauter hurt less); and I will probably never try the bikini area again.

I'm sure it will hurt more/less depending on each person's waxing/shaving history, on the thickness/fineness of the hair, and your level of tolerance for pain. 

RESULTS:

Unless all of your hair grows at the exact same rate, you probably won't have perfectly smooth skin for 'up to 6 weeks' as claimed. However I've found that the porcupine/cactus-like feeling that comes with stubbles growing back after 3 days, is significantly reduced. Also, fair skinned people with dark hair don't have to worry about the leftover roots showing through from under the skin after shaving. It's an added value for people whose hair color is much darker than their skin's.

You may have to do a quick shave or epilate or pluck for maintaining the near perfect hairless skin; straggler hairs are bound to appear for most people.

USAGE:

It is pretty loud for its size and I wouldn't use this at night where there are people sleeping nearby. It's probably almost as loud as my hair dryer.

Sadly there is no depository for the plucked hair so your floor/bathroom can get rather messy. Don't use this on carpeted floors.

I love being able to epilate at my leisure in the comfort of my own bathroom. And if you pay to get waxed regularly, this epilator will pay for itself over a couple of months.

After trying everything else, this tool really works.  My cat loves it, and has made quite a difference in both our lifes.  Best used after a normal grooming (i.e. slicker), and should be used gently.  My cat let's me know when she's had enough for one daily session.  It really goes after the "dead" fur under the top coat.

As others have mentioned, the yoke doesn't feel as solid as a real flight control.  Despite this fact, it is well worth the money.  The elevator(forward and back) motion is smooth and fluid.  The aileron(left and right) motion is a little light to the touch but also very good.  The control levers operation is also very smooth.  There are 2 rocker switches for gear and flaps, and some buttons on the yoke.  Of all of the purchases I have made to enhance flight simulation at home, this device has added the most realism.  NOTE:    If your mounting surface isn't perectly squared on the edge, expect some difficulty in using the included mounting brackets.

This has been a very good router so far (5 weeks). The setup was a breeze, connection times are quick and I have not yet had a dropped connection or needed to reboot. The downside is that the range is less than stellar. I have a relatively small home, and the signal strength drops off fairly quickly as you move away from the router. (I.e. if you have a larger home, you may want to consider a different router.)

I bought this a week ago, and have been very pleased with it's capabilities and operation.  I really like the extra space (I still haven't filled up the 2gigs). The design makes it easy to use, and the screen is easily readable. I haven't figured out how to set up playlists yet, but I haven't tried, either. 

The one feature that I don't like is the auto-shutoff feature.  When I put it on pause, it only waits about thirty seconds before shutting down.  I think this is a good feature in that it helps you save battery power, but at the same time, it does take about 20seconds to boot the thing up, so it can be inconvenient.

It is a really a thing of beauty. Simple looking and elegant. Nice blue light underneath.  These were might first impressions.

I plugged it into my computer, and the space under My Computer only said 9.99 MB!!! I couldn't believe that Lacie would send out a TB hard drive with 1/100,000 the space. I called Lacie support, waited on the phone for a while, and an agent told me I needed to right click My Computer>> Manage. Then there is option to manage disk drives. My computer recognized there was 931 GB unallocated.  So I just needed to delete the only volume there of 10 MB, and then create a new larger volume.

In the end, it works, thanks to the good support from Lacie. It's quiet and doesn't overheat. I think my case was an aberration, but it could happen to more people.

We bought this oven in four months ago, based on Amazon reviews, to replace a different brand that had conked out with no warning, as toaster ovens often do.  This one is a winner.  It toasts quickly and quietly; the beep at the end can be heard a couple of rooms away.  Sometimes a bit of adjustment is needed to assure even toasting -- easy to get the hang of it.  The pull-out crumb tray is a plus, as are the non-stick baking tray, the attractiveness of the unit, and its reasonably trim dimensions.

Other reviewers have mentioned a couple of quirks worth flagging.  "Digital" may be a misnomer, and although you can set baking time of up to 40 minutes, the setting dial doesn't move as the time elapses.  There are 5 baking temperatures only to choose from (they span a wide range).  That said, we're satisfied with the bake function -- no problem with the results.  The convection feature sends the heat from a couple of directions and seems to save time.

The unit looks sturdy and well-built.  At one time we had a Black & Decker that toasted effectively but which we had to toss because the handle got to where it was hanging by a thread and defied any efforts at repair -- got tired of prying it open with a fork prong or a knife.  The Sanyo seems built to last.

I tried a Linksys WRT54G and a Netgear before finally trying this one. The others would not allow my desktop (hardwired to router) to stay online. Had the same problem with this one, but in trouble shooting with a live Linksys rep, I figured out that I needed to treat the system as a LAN, and then everything went fine. It probably was the problem with the previous 2 routers, but no one ever suggested this as a fix, including the tech people from my ISP. Have used this daily for several months now and never have a problem. I'm no geek, so I am disappointed that I can find a solution to a problem that the techies and documentation for these things don't suggest.

The bodygroom works great.  It has a little trouble cutting if the hair is long, but if you trim down with a stronger hair trimmer first, it works fantastic.  If you then keep up with grooming and don't let the hair get too long, you won't have any problems.  I use the trimmer solely without any guard attachment, and don't have to worry about cutting myself.  This works amazing without the guard for trimming the twig and berries.  Also works great on the rump and chest.  I love that you can use it in the shower, so you can wet down the area being shaved and reduce friction and redness.

We bought this litterbox after carefully going over all the reviews and researching different types of boxes.  We have two male cats, one of whom has early stage urinary tract issues that we are trying to manage.  We were nervous about trying the box with him as he has associated litterboxes with pain, and we weren't sure if a new style of box would repel him.  We shouldn't have worried-- both cats took to the litterbox  just fine and actually use it more frequently than they did our previous litterbox.  For our cat with urinary problems, this is an added bonus since cats tend to develop urinary problems partly due to not using the box frequently enough.  They seem to like the privacy the cover provides.  It is easy to clean, and it cuts down tremendously on litter box odor and litter tracking.  Highly recommended product, worth every penny.

I use it for recording my children's music performances.

Plus:
- The video quality is very good. 40x OPTICAL zoom. This was the highest optical zoom I could find in a camera in this price range.
- The sound quality is good in the 12 bit mode, and even better in the 16 bit mode.
- Easy to use.
- Compact.
- Intelligent Lithium battery.

Minus:
- No MiniDV tape included. You will need to buy some.
- NO PASSTHROUGH MODE. This camera cannot accept input from analog sources (like output from an old VHS-C camera or a VCR). If you plan to use this camera to transfer from older analog to digital video, it won't do it.
- Battery life is short, 115 minutes according to book, but I get between 90 and 100 minutes. Buy an NP-FH50 and use the battery that came with the camera as a spare.
- No USB port. You WILL need firewire inputs on your computer to capture the video. And if you purchase from Circuit City, do not expect the sales people to know this.
- No Firewire cable. Factor that in the purchase price. Firewire cables are expensive ($25-$30) IF you buy from a brick and mortar store; expect to pay $8-10 online
- No Remote control. So if you want to put the camera on a tripod, you must manually start and stop the recording.
- No memory slot. MiniDV only.

I've used version 2003 and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I primarily used it for school with different classes and notes for each.  What was great is that is consolidates everything in a way that makes it easy to retrieve your notes. It also makes it easy to generate reports based on the tagging feature.  The tags allow you to highlight and gather key points of information that make writing papers a breeze.  When working with paper, this was not always an easy task to take on.

Several weeks ago, I downloaded the trial version of OneNote 2007.  The improvements are rather subtle, but powerful.  It didn't take anything to get comfortable with the new features.  After a short time with the trial version I just purchased it because it was so much fun. 

Here are some of the beneficial features:

-Like a paper notebook you have sections, but with OneNote 2007 you can have as many sections as you like.

-You can easily link pages to Outlook. I have linked appointments to a series of notes and support files for various projects and meetings. It makes being organized for a meeting a breeze.

-Also, it's a great way to archive emails in a way that allows you to see them and organize them as you wish.  You can empty your in box and at the same time keep a record of important emails.  Well worth your time.

-It is also tablet friendly if you use a tablet PC like I do.  I love it for that use.  There is a fantastic text recognition feature that works EXTREMELY well. If you use a tablet, this is a great feature.

-As was with the earlier version, you can add voice content to your notes. That's right, voice recorded messages can be added to your notes.  Too cool.

Before you buy, you might want to go to the Microsoft site and download the trial version.  You'll be able to assess for yourself.  I think you'll be pleased.  I fond it to be one of the best products for 'electronic file keeping' that I've used.  For the price, it's not a bad deal.

I compared MSI Wind with Acer, Asus, Samsung, Dell and HP, and I felt the MSI was the top netbook for my money. I tried the 8.9" Acer One--the screen was too small. I've had my MSI Wind for 2 1/2 mos. and I'm happy with it. It has the brightest screen even when power cord is unplugged; keyboard spacing is good; battery power at 4+ hours with the option to underclock (Fn F10 unplugged) to extend battery; processor speed is respectable plus the option (Fn F10 plugged in) to overclock up to 24%. I added 1GB Crucial DDR2 that Amazon suggested and it works just fine. I had to remove the sticker underneath, to unscrew the bottom cover, with the note that it would invalidate the warranty. I read in the MSI forums that MSI would honor the warranty even after adding the extra memory.  

My MSI Wind U100-279US "came" with a Synaptics touchpad instead of Sentellic, which I didn't know until I installed the Sentellic driver and (luckily?) it didn't work. So I installed the Synaptics driver and, fortunately, it worked. The scroll up-down, right-left touchpad was a deal maker/breaker for my netbook, and I'm extremely glad my Wind came with Synaptics touchpad. Other drivers I had to update were for the webcam and Ralink wireless from the MSI website. Both worked well. The Ralink draft-N is pretty fast as I'm able to connect at 135 mbps with my DLink N router. Actually, wireless N was one of the features that I favored in the MSI which no other brand had. However, at first, it would disconnect overnight but after I read MSI forums I adjusted the Windows Wireless Power Saving mode to CAM (Continuously Aware Mode) and that fixed it. Wi-fi catcher and wi-fi connection is quite good. I just wonder why MSI didn't install the Synaptics, webcam and Ralink drivers to begin with and I had to install it myself.  But so long as the MSI website had the drivers and the MSI forums provided guidance, overall I'm satisfied with my Wind. I rated it 4 stars because of the extra work required after purchase. My experience with this MSI Wind is positive.

I had all but given up in my quest to find a gaming laptop that could run the latest MMOs (like Warhammer Online) for a price that I could afford until I saw this little powerhouse.  This laptop is extremely high performance, easy to use with an integrated panel for wireless networking, Blue Tooth etc and even a button to overclock (which this computer was designed to do).  However, I have never had to run with overclocking turned on as this PC does it all with ease, even on medium and high performance game settings.  After looking at all these high-end (expensive) laptops that had the high price, but couldn't deliver the performance I was skeptical that this notebook could do all it promised with such a small price tag.  Needless to say I was amazed as it lived up to every expectation I had and usually exceeded them.  Buy this laptop...it is the one!

I'm amazed at how well this simple design works.  I had an inexpensive Chinese motorized trimmer, and it wouldn't trim anything at all, even after minutes of hacking away.  The Platinum XL munches right through those pesky hairs on the first try, and they're trimmed neatly.  

While there's no such thing as a blade that "never dulls", this gizmo gets the whole job done in 20 turns, while the motorized units probably spin around 20 times per second, dulling much faster.  

The Amazon forum on nose hair trimming is an incredible resource.  One member lamented that people just don't talk enough about such things.  I found out who my real friends were very quickly when I started telling everybody what a great job the Platinum XL does on my nose hair.

This is a great little laptop that is nice and light and can hold a charge for most of the day with a good deal of usage. It also has a very reasonable and readable resolution that allows you to work on the preinstalled version of windows xp that this comes with.

The only problems with this laptop are that the HDD they formatted XP on does not have very much space left on it and because of that if you install any applications on that HDD you run the risk of getting disk full messages. So the best thing would have been to put the OS on the larger partition. But oh well, i will be forced to upgrade my SSD to one of the 32GB's or 64Gbs. There is also a good idea to upgrade the ram to 2GB from the preinstalled 1GB. With those upgrades this laptop is similar in specs to 1000+ dollar laptops.

After seeing The Dark Knight, I left the theater, literally shaking because what I had just witnessed was movie making at its very best. This is how movies should be made. There is enough action, twists and turns that your head just spins. The acting alone should make you sit up and take notice because the actors are no longer just players on a stage, but rather they are the embodiment of the characters they have become.

I now finally understand about the three separate movie posters that each show Batman, the Joker and Harvey Dent with half their faces being covered as they hold up something against one side of their face, while the other side has nothing to hide. These are three men with totally separate goals. One is goodness and everything righteous; the other tries to work for good but is caught between two different worlds; the third has no morals or reason for his madness, he just does what he does because he enjoys it. He is like a dog that chases after a car, knowing he will never catch it just because it is fun to do, or so The Joker tries to explain to Harvey his reasons for the chaos and anarchy he causes.

The Dark Knight begins where the last movie has left off. If you haven't seen Batman Begins, no worries, because the director, Chris Nolan, has done a wonderful job of catching the audience up to speed. The first 45 minutes or so are a casual build up, and I admit I was a bit antsy during this time because I was expecting mind numbing action and explosions right away. They come later, and when they do, your heart will be beating a mile a minute.

Gotham's criminals have pretty much been inactive mainly because of Batman. There are still some petty crime and the Mob are in control to extent, but things are pretty ho-hum in the villain department. But then a man with a maniacal laugh and a face painted haphazardly with clown makeup makes his entrance. Gotham will never be the same.

There is a new District Attorney in town and he is Harvey Dent who is a good guy, deep down to his core. Bruce Wayne is not sure about Harvey, in part, because Harvey has stolen away his old love, Rachel Dawes. Harvey is everything Bruce wishes he could be but can't. In order for Bruce to fight crime as Batman, he must do some things that are not very lawful. Bruce has major issues because of his conscience. How far can he go and should go to keep peace and order? Batman is going to have quite the wake up call because The Joker will shake up the order of things in ways you will not see coming.

Whereas Harvey is the face of law and order and is willing to go as far as he can to a point, Batman is given an out because he is a vigilante. Others will turn and look the other way if he has to kill or cause his own chaos to save Gotham. But because Batman has a conscience, unlike The Joker, he will not step over that line even if it means saving the most important people in his life that he cares about. The Joker knows Batman's weaknesses and will do his best to cause total and utter meltdown in Gotham, mainly to get Batman to admit that he has a very dark place inside, that he may have to reach down into, thus becoming The Dark Knight.

The Dark Knight is a very, very dark picture. There is so much death and destruction, and the funny thing is, The Joker is responsible for the set up, but he places the decisions in everyone else's hands, and not his own. He may be the cause, but he is not the effect. Batman and The Joker are very much like the pieces on a chessboard. Because they are each other's nemesis and essentially equal, they are always at a checkmate. Wherever The Joker goes, Batman will follow and visa versa. The odd man out is Harvey and again The Joker uses one of Harvey's weaknesses to get him to do what he wants. The Joker is that little demon on your shoulder that tells you want you want to hear even though it may be so very wrong.

The Dark Knight is not your childhood Batman. Many issues arise where a person's moral being comes into play. Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent are very moral people, but when a man like The Joker comes along, who has no rhyme or reason for the destruction he causes, how can these two men not sink down to his level? That is the main question asked and with the end of The Dark Knight, and future installments of this Batman series, this moral dilemma will be the main focus and a foreshadowing of things to come.

Visually, The Dark Knight is perfect, but the most important reason to go see a movie such as this, even if you are not a fan of superheroes or comic book action, is the acting. Forget about Michael Keaton; Christian Bale has really succeeded in this role where Michael hasn't. I had hoped the direction of what Batman has to become would be a darker and more unstable individual, and Christian has tapped into Batman's psyche wonderfully. Aaron Eckhart almost took over this movie with his portrayal of Harvey Dent. He even outshined Christian in a few scenes.

Last but not least, and I purposely saved the best for last is Heath Ledger. What an incredible way to leave this Earth and on such a high note. I never really appreciated Heath's acting until Brokeback Mountain. I thought he was just another pretty boy actor. I was very much mistaken. If you put all of Heath's scenes together as the Joker, his total on screen running time is about thirty minutes. But those thirty minutes show a true master at work. So many actresses and actors don't have the skill or the inclination to stretch their abilities to the maximum in their work. There are a very select few who vanish as that individual we come to know outside of their professional capacity. They become their character to the point that they disappear in that role. Heath has done so with The Joker. Take the homicidal tendencies of Alex from A Clockwork Orange, with a smidgen of Dr. Hannibal Lector's intuitiveness from Silence of the Lambs, and the face of Gwynplaine from The Man Who Laughs, and you have Ledger's Joker.

I could go on with the praise about Heath Ledger's acting mainly because of the tragedy of his death, but quite honestly, The Dark Knight is a group effort with the three men of, Christian Bale, Aaron Eckhart and Heath Ledger. I have only touched upon a small part of why The Dark Knight is such a wonderful viewing experience. Some may this movie success lies because of the skills of director and his players. Perhaps it is the hardcore fans, or it may possibly be the death of an actor who died so young.

I say this is a fine movie by people who know what they are doing. It is refreshing to know that there are still professionals in the movie industry that want to give the public quality entertainment, and The Dark Knight is such a movie.

Along with Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk, these were the movie highlights of my year. This is a great sequel from Batman Begins where Batman continues his crusade against crime on his own hometown Gotham. Also a great movie to reminisce about Heath Ledger (may his soul rest in peace). He did an awesome job playing the Joker, better than Jack Nicholson. I have not much to say except I totally agree (and highly recommend this movie) with all the reviewers who gave this movie 5 stars! Outstanding!!

It looks good, cooks perfect rice every time, and I use it a lot. It's not very big, so if you feed more than 4 people or so, or like leftovers, you might go for a bigger one.

I was going back and forth on rather to purchase this one or not. I had read the reviews about the gear box being made of plastic and breaking under heavier use, like mixing bread dough. I also read that kitchen aid had fixed the problems with the plastic housing and are making them with a metal box now. However I still was apprehensive to spend so much and maybe get one that still had the plastic. I was going to wait. But my loving husband decided to make the decision for me and bought one for me for Christmas. I LOVE IT! I have made several loaves of bread and cookie dough since Christmas. Hubby even made sure to check the housing before he gave it me, to ensure the gear box problem had been fixed. I am so excited and hope to have years of use from this appliance.

I like the hard drive for a few reasons:

1.  It won't tip over easily.
2.  Looks Great, just like how the picture shows.  Also, the side lights on the hard drive look very stylish, especially when lit up at night.
3.  I had mine on for over 2 days straight and it is only slightly warm if anything.  The fan on the base seems to cool it well.
4.  5 year warranty, many other drives only come with a 1 year warranty.
5.  Installation is 4 steps; and it was easy to do.
6.  Comes with a drive manager program which is easy to use to backup files or whatever.
7.  Great price for 500 GB.
8.  Transfer Rate is fast.
9.  Very Very Quiet.

Disadvantages:

1.  Says 500 GB, but reality you only get 465 GB because the rest of the memory I believe is used for transfering.
2.  Can find lighter hard drives.

Overall:  The hard drive is worth it because it is a great deal for 500 GB from a good company with a 5 year warranty.  I highly recommend it, although you may want to consider this same model but with FireWire for a few more dollars.

I was scared to try this program, because I had read about other people's difficulties, especially with the installation.  And I already know how poor the customer service is at Nuance.  So if you get this program, it appears that you either have to be ready to "go it alone," or you have to have some tech-savvy help available.  I went with (b), and had it installed for me at a local computer company.  All I had to do then was boot it up, take some time with the tutorial, and we were ready to go!  All things considered, the program does amazingly well.  It tends to get tripped up with smaller words that sound alike, but rarely makes a mistake with big words, including professional jargon.  I am discovering that the more time I spend training the program, the better it gets, and even at its worse, it's as good as the dictation service I was using previously (which I consistently had to edit for errrors).  If you're willing to help the program along in the early stages, it's actually a lot of fun.  I'll definitely stick with it.

I've had nothing but good results from the Sansa Fuze.  It "froze" on startup a couple of times in the months since I bought it, but the online help said just hold down the "on" switch and it resets, which it did.  It's very easy to organize the music on my computer, upload it, and play.  It's surprisingly heavy for a small MP3 player, but I guess the idea is to make it feel solid, which it does.  The sound is perfect.  And it looks great.  Haven't played video yet.

It's really nice when you buy a product and it just does what it's supposed to do. This was a Christmas present for my wife and I knew she wouldn't use it if it was too complicated, if it was messy to use or difficult to clean up.

Well, here's the deal: It works just great and the first (and last) waffle that popped out of the little sucker was just perfect. She found that it was easy to guesstimate how much batter to put into it without overflow and it just doesn't have to be cleaned up much because the waffles easily pop loose. It "beeps" when it's ready for batter and it beeps again when your waffle is ready. Couldn't be simpler.

It's small, easy to store and the cord stores neatly on castings in the bottom. It would be a great addition to any kitchen (even in an RV because of it's small size). Buy two if you have a large family!

Just wanted to join in the feedback about this de-shedding tool. It works great! Comes with a plastic protector for the teeth (the teeth are not guaranteed against breaking as stated on the instruction sheet). Just don't overstroke/overcomb your pets with this (you could give them brush burns/sore areas, etc.). Make sure your pets don't have sores and this thing does the job. I have three cats and one of them loves this comb. The other could take it or leave it and the other thinks it's evil. I comb them a bit at a time, twice a day for now, just to reduce the shedding on the microfiber sofa. Please don't think you can entirely strip your pet of any and all undercoat - that isn't possible and that would be kind of painful for the pet! It does help a lot on the shedding around the house. I did try to catch all the fur as I was combing the first time I used it but it really is easier just to comb the cats (no dogs here, sorry) on the rug and vacuum later. The tool definitely has a bit of heft. Yes, it's overpriced, just like most pet products, but this should last several years.

If you are planning on running a server behind this, be advised that the PC running the server has to have a static IP. I thought this was lame as I use DHCP and didnt feel like reconfiguring my TCP/IP settings. ALso, it didnt work too well with my B card, which was a bummer because it said it would. Also, the housing on the router is really lightweight and seems like it would break if I dropped it once.However, this router had good compatibility with my cable modem and was a snap to set up with my wireless NetGear WGR511 card. It had good range (It's on my first floor, and even on third floor had full 54 speed). It supports WPA, which is very good security.

I saw this movie a long time ago on tv. And was hooked. I thought I must have this movie. The next time I found out that it was going to be on tv, I recorded it. Then sometime later, the tape got wrecked and it was un-watchable. For awhile I looked and looked for this movie and could not find it. Then looking at a music store one day, I happened to find it. Even thought it had been quit a while since the last time I had seen the movie. When I watched it, it was like I just saw it yesterday. It made an impression on me from my childhood. I never watched the movie for good acting, special effects or anything like that. I watched it just for the sake of watching it and enjoying it. In my opinion, I think if you go about analyzing movies all the time. You are going to miss out on some great movies. Because their will be somthing about the movies that you won't like. And you won't give them a chance.

I am really impressed with this electic reamer, particularly given the price.  I do master cleanse multiple times during the year, and this has made it so much easier.  I have only used it for lemons.  It does all of the work; there's no need to press hard on the fruit.  I think that because it is lightweight, pressing too hard could hurt the motor.  It's only getting 4 stars due to a minor point -- the stirrer in the top part of the juicer causes seeds to fly out of the machine after I have reamed only 2-3 lemons so I have to remove the seeds from the filter regularly when I'm making a lot of juice.  I would definitely buy it again!

This is a cool hair removal system. My skin is sensitive when pulling out the hairs but it works and I didn't get a lot of red marks and when I do they just vanish in a couple of hours. I love the shaver head that comes with it, I like it more than the epilation head because the shaver head cuts really close without no nicks, it also has a trimer that is right in front of the shaver that works really fast and it glides smooth on your skin. The light helps in dim places so you can light up your skin to see if you got all of the hairs epilated or shaven, it's like an extra.  If you like getting rid of unwanted hairs fast without the hassle and the mess, this is the way to go. I tried creams that make your hair fall out with melting the hair off of your skin that is really harsh on your body and leaves red bumps all of the time and it's a mess to do, also waxing doesn't get you very far when you have to wait for your hair to grow long enough for it to strip off and the wax is messy and sticky. I am telling you that the Silk-epil Xelle epilator is NOT a wast of money at all.

I have been a Braun tooth brush user for 15 years.  This is my 1st Sonicare purchase so it will take some getting used to.  

Pros:  Rechargeable and holds it's charge for several days.
Auto shut off after two minutes.
Comes with a case to neatly store for traveling.
Space saver - comes with a holder once charged you can put away the charger and sit your tooth brush in stand provided.

Con:  Where the tooth brush head seats in the unit it doesn't stay put, it slowly loosens and each time I use it I have to tighten it again.

Over all I am happy with my purchase and I would recommend it. 

It's a good deal for the price.

This review is from: The Wizard of Oz (DVD)

      



This is a true Hollywood classic. Normally seen as a children's film, it is also a splendid joy for adults, as well. Who can forget the catchphrase "there's no place like home" or some of the songs-"Over the Rainbow," "Ding! Dong! The Witch is Dead" and a few others?

In case you just came to Earth because you lived on Mars for your entire life, the story is about a lonely Kansas girl named Dorothy (Judy Garland-her most famous role)who hits her head in the middle of a tornado. She then has a dream that she is in the magical land of Oz, and tries to get to a Wizard to go home. She ends up making friends with a man out of tin, a lion and a scarecrow all who want things from the Wizard too. There is a witch in the way, however, and things get worse when they get to the Wizard and he wants them to kill the witch. 

The movie, made in Hollywood's Golden Year 1939, was one of the first in Technicolor and it is probably the most glorious use of color in a movie I have ever seen. When Dorothy first gets to Oz...it's one of the best moments in movie history. The acting-Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Billie Burke and the biggest assembly of "little people" ever recorded-is great and you have to love some of the "little" characters, the Munchkins especially.

I was searching for a compact camcorder that used standard batteries instead of the usual rechargeable packs and discovered the RCA and the Flip Video which both use AA batteries. I found a demo Flip unit and thought the picture quality looked surprisingly good, but I really had to repeatedly mash the button to start or stop recording. Too tough for the family to use. So I ordered the RCA and an 8-Gig Micro-SD (memory) card which is unbelievably tiny; about the size of your pinky fingernail. With it I could record more than 4 hours in high quality mode or 16 hours in web quality mode. Amazing and very inexpensive! It powers-up instantly and the record button is easy to push. It also shoots still photos easily. It's simple transferring the files to a computer with it's built-in USB connector. The video files are AVI, so being a Mac family we have to convert them to use with iMovie or iDVD, but that's not a big deal using Quicktime Pro. The only other slight drawback is that the zoom is only about 2 to 1 and noticeably degrades the picture quality. But for it's size, cost and ease of use it's an easy trade-off. We'll shoot a lot more video because it's so quick and fun to have along, and use the bigger cameras for more zoom intensive shoots.

Good burr grinders are hard to find at any price, and this one is very nice and nicely priced.  The grinding cone comes right out for cleaning and is nearly impossible to assemble incorrectly.  A little coffee gets stuck in the chute, but just brush it and shake it out over the sink.  Get a bigger cleaning brush (a baster or chip brush work well) and you'll be set.

My Dad found this toy and gave it to our kitties, six-month-old Gracie and six-year-old Zoe for Christmas. We knew that Gracie would play with it and she did...giving it lots of kangaroo kicks and kicking it around like a soccer ball. Then all of a sudden one night, Zoe, who rarely plays with any toys, suddenly picked up the squirrel in her mouth and started crying the most unusual meows.

It has now become a daily and nightly ritual during which Zoe will pick up the squirrel in her mouth, meow while moving him, drop him and then meow some more. It is both adorable and hilarious and I never would have believed that a toy could affect her this way. I cannot recommend this little squirrel enough...it is so unique and has brought out a side of Zoe that is just priceless.

Thanks Dad!

This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)

      



Wall-E should be seen by people of all ages. Don't be quick to judge this as something just for children, for there are plenty of adult overtones amidst the simplicities of emotions and feelings [that a child could relate to]. I'm an adult and I think this is one of the best animations I've ever seen, both visually and emotionally. Labeling it enjoyable wouldn't do it justice.

Wall-E is a fun, lovable robot whose directive (a term you'll find used quite a bit) is  just to compact trash. That's it. Compact trash again and again. But this little guy has a personality and cute mannerisms that will allow you to appreciate his character more than you would expect. It doesn't matter that he can't speak - you'll love him. As expected with Pixar pictures, our protagonist is introduced, then faces a difficult situation, successfully deals with said situation, and a happy ending follows. The plot slightly suffers when Wall-E faces his obligatory difficult situation, but the visuals barely save it. Prepare for an ending of gratification.

Please see this movie.  You may or may not like it.  I believe that if everybody (believing or not) could watch and discuss this film maybe more hearts would open up and a new type of understanding could occur.  Bill may be crude and smug but he is the only person, I know of, in "the media" or in a public role that is honest enough to say he doesn't believe and like all of us, he is judged for it.  This film will make you think. Maybe not in the way Bill was hoping for, but lets get the line of communication open.

Pre-Turbotax, I had to pay a lawyer/accountant $2,000 for a state return and $2,000 for a fed. return for my humble Chapter S. I shudder to think of those days, before TurboTax for Business was around. 

I bought a duo chip Mac for the SOLE purpose of using TurboTax for Business, which is still unsupported in an online or Mac platform. That's really my only complaint. That and the fact that it doesn't provide a way to see your return in PDF without downloading Adobe Acrobat. I am very unskilled on Windows and that intimidates me. I think the application should provide a way to review all the return without going to another application. Thanks for listening.

I got a shopworn 8GB version with 1 GB RAM for $375 or about $125 off normal retail.


Pros:
*Boots in 10 to 15 seconds, or about 1 1/2 minutes quicker than XP
*No bloatware from the factory.  You get applications  with no nag ads for AOL or some credit card you didn't ask for.
*Except for touchpad, well built
*Recognizes printers, cameras, etc and will even download drivers if necessary, all w/o your interference.  Try that with XP (has the driver "find" system ever worked on XP?)
*About 2 pounds
*2 year warranty
*Uses a cell phone style charger instead of the heavy brick
*Voice commands easy to turn on.  My IBM Thinkpad doesn't offer that.  Talk and activate programs.
*Better speakers than 99% of the laptops, which isn't saying much.  Won't outplay your Pioneer stereo, but it will sound better than most MP3 players out there
*Finds network signals I didn't know exist
*Disturbingly quiet.  After years of listening to grinding hard drives and fans, it's somewhat disconcerting to hear nothing (and I do mean nothing!).
*Don't let Linux scare you, it's a generic version of Windows and the included O/S is designed for the techologically limited.

Cons:
*2 1/2 hour battery?  Ever hear of lithium?
*Runs hot, typical Celeron.  Doesn't bog down, though
*Touchpad is useless, fortunately mine came with a mouse
*If the webcam works, it's hiding
*Keypad takes time to get used to.  Helps to have paperclip thin fingers.   Get a wireless keyboard unless you enjoy cramping.
*Nice that it comes with a neoprene carrying bag, but they forget an area for the charger.  Relatively worthless
*Downloading new applications can be a bear if you don't understand Linux.  Fortunately, I do.

Overall?  You really can't lose.  My guess is the HDDs will get larger as time goes on and MS is offering Windows XP as an option in 2008.  As long as Vista doesn't creep in there, it's a good deal for those on the go!

So good so far.... I haven't used this one much yet but I have another WD hard drive that I've been using for a few years now with no complaints. The other drive is the same as this one just a smaller capacity. I bought the 320 to replace my Seagate 320 that crashed after less than a year of ownership.... POS! I've talked to several people who have had the same problem with Seagate hard drives.

Not only does it remove tons of dead fur off of my cats, they seem to enjoy it...purring and rolling over so I can get their belly!  My only regret is that I didn't buy this years ago....  Spend the money, it'll be WELL worth it!

Great camcorder.  Technology has really come along way, especially for those of us that started out with videotape... the price wasn't bad either.  I have only taken about an hour of video.  The camera is user friendly and performs very well.  I look forward to capturing many great moments in the future.  Hopefully the camera will perform well for several years.  I hope that I can make numerous DVD's and actually watch them in many years from now before new technology replaces all of the equipment.  I'm still converting old VHS tapes...

A lot of people who complain about the Bodygroom talked about how it pulls hairs. Well I figured it was just because people hadn't pre-trimmed any longer hairs, but this is not always the case. Before purchasing the Bodygroom, I used to use scissors and/or a razor to take care of hair in various places, so my hair was already relatively short. The Bodygroom did a great, even job with most of it, but in some areas, especially where the hair is thicker (not specifically longer), there was still some pulling. After using it for a couple months, every once in a while I would still get a tug, but I think it is mainly because I wasn't using the shaver on a regular basis.

This razor is extremely easy to operate, easy to clean (not easy to replace the blades if they get messed up, so be careful), and isn't awkward to hold or use. I think the problems that this shaver has would afflict any razor, so I can't fault it; I just wish these companies could come up with a system that didn't have pulling.

I did some comparison between different netbooks before I bought the Eee PC 1000HA. Here are some comments to share:

Pros:  

Eee PC 1000HA 10" screen is much better than Acer Aspire One 9" screen and the Eee PC 900 series due to its larger keyboard size. I bought the Acer Aspire One and liked everything but the small keyboard. Hard to use. I had to return it to the store in a couple of days. I feel comfortable typing with the Eee PC 1000HA keyboard (except the shift key, which will be discussed in the cons below.)

I looked at the MSI Wind 10" in Bestbuy and liked everything, including the looking, feel, keyboard, etc. But, the Wind felt so hot at the bottom of the display computer in the store. I did not know the exact reason for the hight heat in the store, but the Eee PC I used at home generates much less heat -very cool.

The battery is longer than other comparatible netbooks. 

Cons: 

The only thing that I do not like about this Eee PC is the key layout. The right shift key is too small in a bad location. I always type wrongly when I have to use right shift key. I like the MSI Wind keyboard and HP Mini-Note keyboard much better. I hope that Eee PC will improve the keyboard in the future.

Although this Eee PC has the longest batter life among many netbooks, it worths to mention that the Eee PC does not have 7 hours battery life as claimed. If you use Wifi and auto battery save mode, it only lasts 4 to 4.5 hours.  

Overall, it is a good buy with the very low price!

This moderate pace pixar offering pokes fun at big retail chains -modern electronics making things easyer and the orginal Star Trek-with the  five year mission bit.Wall-E looks like a cut down version of #5 The animation well Pixar just gets better with age,the story a good family draw.the short in front also funny.
The short is about a Magican,his two hats (one traditional,the other wizardlike),and his pet rabbit.Who doesn't want too come out of the hat (more too the point through)untile he gets his carrot.The Magican you see promised the carrot but the curtain went up .It appears the old hat trick requires two hats and some unseen magic portal that is built between them.This portal allows for objects pass between the hats..and aids in the mishap performence.

I love coffee but I hate making a full pot just for myself or having to go down the street to get a cup from the local convenience store.  This is perfect for me.  I was going to get the "mini" B30 model but decided to get the B40 model instead.  The machine does make some noise but it isn't that loud.  I think I only made note of the noise because some reviews said that it was loud so I actually paid attention to it.  Otherwise I probably wouldn't have noticed.  The coffee brews very quickly which worried me at first because I thought that the coffee would be weak or not hot enough but it was made to my liking.  The machine is very easy to use and clean up is as simple as flipping the handle and lifting the used K-Cup out.  The footprint is a little large for a smaller kitchen.  I have an eat in kitchen but lack sufficient counter space and outlet availability so the biggest challenge was finding a place for it.  If space is a problem, go with the B30.  If not the features of the B40 as compared to the B30 make it worth the extra money spent.

We have two dogs -  a Bernese Mountain Dog and a Leonberger - both are huge dogs that shed all year round.  The FURminator has worked beautifully.  Not only do the dogs look much better, there is less hair around the house which means less vacuuming and cleaning.  It is easy to use, and the dogs don't mind it at all.  The amount of hair you will see come off of your dogs will be unbelievable to you.  It works exactly as it does in the FURminator video where the woman is brushing a Golden and clumps of hair just basically fall off.  For the price, you will not regret this purchase.

They look good, and they didn't shrink much on first washing.  They also didn't ball up.  They are just a bit wrinkly after washing, and not as soft as one could wish for, but for the price, they are good sheets.

Just more on my experience - I have now washed them many times, and even bought another set - they get much softer with each washing and I think they are a great value. They hold their color pretty well - I did have some light bleaching where I sleep with my face on the sheet when I have benzoil peroxide on my skin, but it would be hard to find colored sheets that could resist that completely.

I was a little leary of this product, after all, I had tried all the topical ointments and nothing worked. But I am thrilled with this product. Although the directions indicated it might takes weeks to see an improvement I noticed a big difference in just a week. My dogs eyes aren't as runny and after I took him to the groomers and had his hair trimmed the brown tear stains are all gone and have not returned! Also, it hasn't affected him eating his food either. My dog is finicky so I was concerned he might notice the taste and not eat it when I added it to his food. But it either has no taste or tastes good cuz he still eats his food without a problem. This product is worth trying!

I approached the purchase with trepidation because of the negative reviews, however, I love this product and hope to ease someone's concern about purchasing.  My one caveat is that it is confusing to set, but just go step by step exactly as the manual says, and you should be fine. Don't lose the manual.  Additionally, my other dislikes are that it is only battery operated (I wish it could also be plugged in), and that it feeds in only 1/4 cup increments.  

I have two cats who are fed three times per day.  They can hear the motor for the feeder turn on, and they scurry to the cat feeder.  I no longer have kittens under my feet tripping me every time I go near their food, and I am not longer considered the source.  I like that they are fed on regular intervals, and as a very busy student, I no longer fear that I will leave my cats starving if I'm studying at the library until 2 A.M.

I initially purchased this product for my obese cat that I just could not convince to lose weight.  The vet said that she always seemed hungry because she really just wanted my attention, and the cat imagined that food was attention.  Within 2 months of using the feeder, my cat lost 2lbs and was much healthier.

As mentioned earlier, I am a bit concerned about the fact that this feeder provides food only in 1/4 increments.  With one cat, 5/8 of a cup may be the ideal amount.  Any more and they are fat, and any less, they are underfed.  Now that I have two cats, I haven't been able to figure out the best way to feed them.  I am sure you can play with the machine and use fix-it skills to make the machine dish out more or less.  However, I didn't really plan on having to do that with a $70.00 machine.  I would say that the next edition should have changeable wheels to dish out the food, allowing more options for serving size.

However, other than that concern, this machine works like clockwork.  I have never had it jam, my cats don't steal food from it, it's been working for eight months, and I am very pleased with the product.

I like it a lot. I don't use the shifting console but wheel and peddles are very smooth and linear. The only thing I don't like is that it centers slightly off center. There may be a way to adjust this but I haven't tried to look yet

Let me start off with a complaint: accessories for this camera are not cheap! 

That being said, the camera is great. It doesn't shoot high-def, but it does take otherwise great pictures and the features on this product are pretty great. 

However, in hindsight and with further research (and a little more money) I would now get the upgraded version with a 60 gig and 50x optical zoom. However, this camera is great for the price I paid and I can assure you the camera has some amazing features.

The 42x optical zoom is enhanced even more by the digital zoom, but I can assure you you can read what someone is doing at least 25 feet away on a computer screen with clarity! My dad took a shot of his license plate at 75 yards and was able to read it easily. 

The 40gig hard drive is also an excellent plus, but keep in mind that memory is getting cheaper and a 16 gig SDHC card on amazon only runs you about 30 dollars at the moment. That just means that expansion is easy and a 60 gig isn't necessary anymore--but an increase in optics isn't as easy to come by (hence the 50x/60 gig recommendation). 

Either way there isn't really anything bad worth saying about this camera. I did get the Lumix FZ-28, though... and if you're into serious photography just go ahead and get that instead of this one. If you're serious about optics with that you can always get an extra lens or two!

It still looks like it's new, brews good coffee, they love the timer on it, and it's a good design with no real flaws that they've experienced.

I purchased this item and received it in record time. It is simple efficient and easy to use. I read the reviews here and had yogurt the next morning. I used organic milk that was "ultra pasturized" (The only "ultra" I could find. (With Ultra no need to temper the milk) Added 1/2 cup of dried milk and a 1/2 cup of plain active yogurt. I microwaved the milk instead of heating on the stove for 3 minutes, Placed it in the machine and 12 hours later had great yogurt. The yogurt was thick and creamy and was not in the least bit sour.I purchased this machine because the price of yogurt is going through the roof. For pennies I was able to make a plain yogurt which I then could make into my husbands favorites.  Coco, Loco and pineapple and you have pina colada, cranberry sauce is great also. I would highly recommend.

I just purchased the Philips Norelco BG2020 from Amazon a few weeks ago, and it was everything I expected - Shaving sensitive areas without the fear of a cut, or snag, whatever.  I kind of wish that it would shave faster - like a face shaver for example. Perhaps if it shaved any faster, it might be a bit more dangerous though...

I must say that "feeling fresh" is what this product helps you feel :-)

Amazon also offers 3 Cruzer flash drives as a package - 16,8,4GB combo deal. But it's no bargin, as the drives are sold by 2 sellers. eTECH charges $1.95 for shipping, but Digital Media Source charges $11.90 for the other two drives (first class, not priority mail). So if you think you're saving money by buying a set of 3 drives, you're wrong.

I really like this camcorder.  The only thing that I could complain about is that it is so small for my large hands.  I'm amazed at how small it is, and the above isn't really a complaint as much as an observation that the location of the buttons are more well suited to a person with smaller hands.

There are other reviewers who've commented on the technical stuff, so I won't go into that here.  I will say, that I'm glad I got this camcorder, and recommend it to others who want a simple to operate excellent quality camcorder.

I saw this when it premiered, and even though I have been married almost 30 years, I recognized so much that is true of marriages of any length.  The movie is funny, inspiring, heartbreaking, and so well done it's impossible to believe that a CHURCH could have produced it  -- although I've seen the other films produced by this church and I would run, not walk, to get to see or buy any of them.  I'm going to pre-order 5 copies: 1 for us, and 4 for each of my children.

I LOVE this epilator. I am a regular waxer and the problem with that is that you have to wait for the hair to be at least 1/4" long before you can wax again. I used this for my lower legs and it works.... I have been able to wear skirts and shorts all through spring and summer. :)  The thing really pulls out the tiniest hairs and is SOOOOOOOO much better than shaving!  Ah! yes, the pain?  Its really a tingly stinging sensation. And after a couple of times of using it  you dont even feel that.  Use the pressure-before-pain techinique, i.e. use the fingers of your free hand to stretch out the skin before you go over it and you will be fine.  Upper thighs are more sensitive so you might want to test before, however I have used it on the inner thighs and very satisfied.  Its great to take out those stray hairs on your toes and the tops of your feet if you are one of those hobbit ladies like me! :) Try it out, really. Using it just once will pay for itself considering waxing costs about $50 per session.  I definitely recommend it.

This review is from: Slumdog Millionaire (DVD)

      



The plot of "Slumdog" has already been blabbed away. I enjoyed it a lot; life's lessons can teach a lot more than most schools.This is a finely crafted film, thanks to the always wonderful Danny Boyle; a whole bunch of wonderful kid-actors make the flash-back moments so hopefully  heartfelt.A wonderful cast. The amazing editing and brilliant photography add to the progression of the plot at large, showing past & present. I was impressed that this simple story, that almost didn't find a distributor, appeared to the public.  This is a feel-good film, but subtitles may keep some Oscar voters away. The Oscars have made lots of mistakes; the absence of Dev Patel as a nominee is just another Oscar travesty.  It's as earnest a performance as I've seen. "Crouching Tiger", Life is Beautiful", "Z", "The Emigrants", and other foreign language films have been darlings at the Oscars, all sub-titled. "Slumdog Millionaire" is a worthy film. Kids should see it to know the importance of "learned knowledge", though the subtitles may not make it as accessible to the general public (and kids). I was moved by this film, and the impeccable artistry for a "small" film. Bravo, Danny Boyle!

I was skeptical about pedometers after owning a few. They tended to give false readings, usually because they logged any kind of body movement as a "step." So, whoopee, I logged lots of steps just while sitting in my desk chair at work and doing all the turns to and from the computer, standing up to reach over for something and then sitting down, etc. But not walking. One pedometer I bought a few years ago, which had a "speaking" function, counted steps when lying in the side pocket in my car door, and would periodically announce that I'd walked another mile as we bumped along a road. Amusing, but not particularly useful.

But I do want to build more weight-bearing activity, including walking, into my daily routine, and I know a good pedometer could be helpful with this. I decided to buy the Omron HJ-112 after seeing the good rating by Consumer Reports and reading all these reviews on amazon.

I am actually delighted, and surprised, that this pedometer functions as described. Readings that are accurate, so far as I can tell, within reasonable limits. It does work while being carried in my jacket pocket as well as clipped to my belt. It resets itself to zero at midnight and is easy to read and use.

I had truly written off the whole pedometer thing as a massive fraud perpetrated on consumers, at least as to any affordable devices. It's wonderful to be proved wrong.

Transferring files with the drive plugged into my MacBook Pro was quite speedy. I achieved read/write speeds of 137/94 Mbps. By comparison, my 2gb Memorex mini travel drive gets an abysmal 81/30 Mbps. It would have been nice for backing up with rsync if the drive supported file permissions, but this shouldn't bother most users.

NerdBoyTV is a BIG fan of this little innovative video camcorder. When my 14-year-old was a baby and toddler, I lugged around a GIGANTIC Hi-8 (remember those) camcorder. I remember videotaping EVERY moment, yawn, and giggle and have about 15 two-hour tapes of her. Then came the three boys and I just lost the energy to pull the big, awkward camcorder out to film anything.

How I wish they had this little gadget back then...

But, I'm making up for lost time quickly. Now, at parties, restaurants, parks, events, or at home, I just click the Flip Video Camcorder on like a digital camera and start recording. The video AND audio are quite impressive considering the size of the unit.

What I like best is that the camera is as easy-to-use as a digital camera...just point and click. You'll find that you're more willing (and ready) to capture everyday events that you'll treasure for a lifetime.

...and isn't that the point of having a camcorder anyway?

PROS: 
* Easy-to-use (most important) with a fairly intuitive user interface
* Small, compact, and quickly accessible
* Software built into the camera; just plug-and-play
* Can easily upload to YouTube.com
* Proof that even a kid can use it; my 6-year-old uses it all the time!
* Inexpensive and now comes is a variety of nifty colors

CONS: 
* Buttons a little awkward for those of us with "stubby" fingers
* USB arm connector is difficult to attach to some computers
* Why even bother with a 30-minute version of this camera? Stick with the 60-minute!

We recently had to replace our toaster because one of the cats had knocked it to the floor when jumping onto the counter. While researching for a new one I came across the Back to Basics TEM500 Egg-and-Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg Poacher. A clever idea but how useful would it be in practice? However, the price was right and there would be no problems returning it to Amazon, so I ordered it. After using it for a month here are my observations.

1. Toasting performance: excellent; it may be the best toaster I have owned.
2. Cooking a poached egg: excellent and very easy to do.
3. Cooking soft/hard boiled eggs: not as good. The shells need to be pierced and sometimes the cooked egg will ooze from the hole. The bottom of the supplied water measuring cup has an egg piercer.
4. A complete toast/poached egg/Canadian bacon sandwich: perfect.
5. Cleanup: very easy.

Overall I am very pleased with the unit and would deinitely recommend it to others.

I purchased this camcorder about 3 days ago and have made 2 dvds and uploaded a couple YouTube videos. I really like it:
- Size - small & light - fits nicely in hand - on-off button requires a second hand to use - the 'start video' button may be pressed accidently
- ease of use - quite easy to use - has an 'easy' mode that you can select or de-select at will.  Not a great selection of user-defined modes for the casual user, but sufficient for my purposes
- video quality - excellent in good light - adequate in dim lighting. I noticed that it shows better on my hi-def TV than on my computer monitor, probably need to adjust the color balance on computer monitor...  The zoom in and out works very smoothly - much nicer than other camcorders I have used in the past 19 years.
- editing - took me a couple hours to figure out editing. I used the bundled software initially - but it is minimal in features, and I have used Pinnacle Studio and Premiere for at least 8 years... I tried Sony MovieStudio and couldn't get it to import.  I tried Ulead 11.5 and still couldn't get it to import. I tried to import and convert using the bundled software, and that worked, but was not easy.  Finally, I found a website that suggested the newest Pinnacle Studio - 11 - upgraded to that and it works like a snap. Easy to import multiple files, rename video clips that you import, editing is easy, output to whatever format you desire.  Burns DVDs with great menu and titles options.
- hardware - battery life limited - I got the extra-strength battery as a backup, 2 16G cards, and am getting the external battery charger.  The plug-in charger takes a long time to charge.
- others - i like being able to review the clips I just shot on the camcorder and delete ones that were mistaken 'start recording' button pushes... I also like being able to import bout 20 minutes of video files in a couple minutes, having them available to edit on computer shortly thereafter.  MUCH faster than copying DV tapes using firewire... also nice having the clips broken down already into individual files for each start-stop in the tape - i think this makes the rendering easier... I also like the instant-on of recording - where it starts recording within a second of me pushing the button.  No need for HD to spin up, or tape to start... just record to flash.

Would LOVE to have this in the shock-proof and water-proof model that the competitor makes, but will just have to be careful

KitchenAid has made a fantastic hand blender. I love its multiple speeds and tough and sturdy feel. I think I'll have it for a very long time. This blender really packs a wallop - I like to make smoothies with ice cubes, and a few seconds of blending is all it takes for a frothy, perfectly pureed drink. Conventional blenders usually leave me with unblended ice chunks, but not this blender! 

The only thing that surprised me about the KitchenAid KHB100BU Hand Blender is that it is huge - it's longer than my entire forearm, from fingertips to elbow. So storing it is not quite as easy as I had anticipated, but it's totally worth it!!!

I purchased the router only for use with my new sony VAIO pcg-v505dx. I was a bit worried initially that I would have difficulty getting the router to talk to the laptop's built-in wireless adapter, but I needn't have worried-despite the fact that I ad never set up a home network before, I was up and running in minutes.  The laptop and router had no problems communicating.From what I've read about home wireless network security, this one seems to have all the essential features:  WPA, the ability to filter by MAC address of the machines on the network,  ability to disable DHCP, etc.  the online configuration is a snap, although there are a lot of options to hunt through, and not all of the security settings related to wireless networking are in one place.  I particularly appreciate the router's logging feature, since I can check it to make sure nobody has hacked into my network and is accessing the net using my router.One of my prime concerns was signal strength-I wanted to be able to go anywhere in my somewhat large apartment and still get decent signal.  I'm very, very pleased in this regard, I can be in the back bedroom and the signal strength seems as strong as it is next to the router. I've been using it for three hours straight and it's dropped the connection once (which might well have been my fault, I was fiddling with the XP network settings at the time).Cisco has a very strong rep in the industry as being a leader in quality networking equipment, and from what I can see, the Linksys line upholds that.  This is a good product.

Bought this slicer to suffice until I found a better replacement for my German model.  I am in no hurry now.  This thing gets the job done.  It's relatively easy to clean (they are all a pain) definitely more so than my last one.  Dollar to value I humbly submit tis the best buy.  I liked the design even better than the higher priced models which I was prepared to pay.  The only reason it got 4 out of 5 stars is that the center lock is flimsy plastic and although mine hasn't broke I can see the future.  My last model did have a better center blade lock about the size of a 50 cent piece with thumb grooves and made of hard plastic.  Probably easy to improvise a replacement but I am being extra cautious with it.

This is a perfect product for a perfect homemade yogurt. I have used this 3 times already since I received this last 2/1/08 & now it's 2/12/08 and about to make another one again today. Each time I used this I never encountered any problem but all the yogurt I made turned out perfectly done all the time. The only thing you need to provide before you start making your yogurt is the thermometer. This product do not come with thermometer but it wasn't a big deal since it can be purchased at Wallmart or on e-bay for a digital one. The thermometer is very important so you can get a right temperature whenever you added the starter yogurt. I highly recommend (Salton yogurt maker) this product to everybody who does like to eat a lot of yogurt and at the same time wants to save more money then this is all the product you need plus comes with a very easy & brief instruction to follow. This product is in a very reasonable price as well compared to another yogurt maker with the same result.

This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) [HD DVD] (HD DVD)

      



I fully expected the Hollywood film industry to screw this film up. That expectation evaporated from the moment I heard Peter Cullen's voice over the Opening Credits. I think the filmakers have done a pretty good job taking the relevant bits of Transformers lore and presenting them to a mainstream audience. Clearly, Michael Bay's aim was to entertain an audience, rather than load the film down with Transformers lore. This is a grown-up version of the cartoon I used to love when I was a kid. Miraculously, the film was respectful of the legacy left by the animated series. And considering just how badly the film could've been handled in the wrong hands, that really is a miracle.

Transformers marks my very first purchase of a Hi-Def release in any format (Blu-Ray or HD-DVD). I also have the DVD Edition, so I was able to compare the two. Even to my untrained eye, the Hi-Def version is incredibly detailed. I could even see the wrinkles on Optimus Prime's face - a detail I missed on the DVD version. The sound in Hi-Def is also incredible - I almost jumped out of my chair during the Qatar Base attack.

The extras are pretty good too - not Lord of the Rings Extended Edition quality but still good. Obviously there's a lot of attention shown to the incredible special effects. But there's also a bit of attention paid to how a Michael Bay set is run - he seems to be a pretty tough taskmaster. The commentary from Michael Bay is also surprisingly honest and unflinching. 

I acknowledge that hardcore Transformers fans will not be happy with this film. Look at it this way - this is a film that introduces mainstream audiences to Transformers. It's the first film to bring almost-Anime-Japanese-style mecha action to American audiences, which counts as a milestone in my book. I don't know just how Michael Bay and co are going to top this spectacular film, but I can't wait to find out!

Yep, I'm a little spoiled having gotten used to the commercial-grade Vitamix blender (four hundred fifty bucks, yikes) I was using at the meditation center where I recently stayed for several months.  

This Oster costs 1/9th of that (fifty bucks at my local Sams), and has only 1/2 horsepower as compared to 2 horsepower---which mainly shows up when I try to make smoothies using frozen bananas cut in half.  It's fine with soft bananas combined with ice cubes, but with the frozen bananas I have to be very gentle and patient with it because I don't wish to burn out the engine.  Have had it for about 3 months now, I'd like it to last at least 2 years as all my other hundred-bucks-and-under blenders have, I make a smoothie for breakfast almost every day so lots of use.

It's a bit of a stretch for Oster to call this blender "Professional Series" but overall I love the look and functionality of this little baby.  The black base is sleek and fingerprint-free, the glass pitcher is nice and thick and easy to clean, the single speed switch is so much easier to use than the multi-speed buttons on KitchenAid and Cuisinart blenders I've used in the past, and the all-metal drive mechanism is a huge improvement over the plastic/rubber parts the otherwise nice K.A. blender had (I forget what the Cuisinart had).  Cleaning is also a snap, though it does take a little getting used to the way in which the rubber washer and the blade fit into the pitcher...seems a little counterintuitive but that's a minor quibble.  

Now if Oster would come out with a full one HP blender based on this design, I'd happily pay twice as much for twice the power!  Oster, are you listening?

I'm a photographer and needed to upgrade from my old 12" Powerbook. The larger screen, better graphics card and overall memory size all combine to make this a great laptop. If you're reading this as someone considering changing from PC to MAC all I can say is DO IT! Once I bought my first Mac I vowed never to return to the impractical, unreliable, dated PC format - all you need is Office for the Mac and everything else is just plain better!

I read all of the reviews of this item (and MANY other routers) and I finally decided to go with the Netgear because I liked what I read overall and no model of any brand seemed to work well for everyone.  So far, I have had zero problems.  I took the slow route in setting it up probably and it took me maybe thirty minutes.  It has worked flawlessly since then.  I would encourage everyone in the market for a new router to read as many reviews as they can find and then make the best choice for their situation.  I am using this with one desktop machine, one laptop and a DSL connection.  For my situation, this is the perfect purchase.  I hope I can still say that in another year or two.

I bought this to backup three computers.  160gb was more than enough for my needs.  Simply plug in the USB and install the software. The software installation process was not very obvious but I got there eventually. 
The software includes a very nice back-up tool.  My first back-up took approx 2 hours. Now I connect the usb every week or so and it automatically checks my computers for changes and adds them to the back-up.  Other Pros: fits in a shirt pocket, it's quiet, uses the usb connector for power.  Cons: none that I can think of!

OK, a scientific analysis of just what happens when you treat your shaver to an automatic cleaning & lubrication is not forthcoming, nor is  it necessary. It's enough to say that if you do it, you will believe (as I do) that each shave with your Braun is like its first (except, perhaps, that it's better than your actual first electric shave because your face & beard have been broken in). The CCR Synchro Shaver System is compatible with my old Braun 8995 and my new 9500. It's a wonderfully clean & convenient way to keep you shaver in peak condition & to, literally, make each shave like the first.

Wow - I read many of the reviews in detail before I decided to shell out the bucks for this expensive toothbrush and finally after a couple weeks of arguing with that voice in my head about how big a waste it would be - I took the big bite and ordered it.  Let me just say, the first couple times wasn't all that enjoyable and like many others, I forgot to place it in my mouth before turning it on.  The plus side of that was my sink, counter, and mirror were cleaner for those first couple weeks than they had been in weeks.  Once I got used to the feeling though, I really started to enjoy the toothbrush.  The biggest drawback is that it has its own timer on when to shutoff - I feel like it needs to go for just a little longer - but not a big deal, I just hit the button again and brush until I feel I'm done - then turn it back off.

Definitely recommend - teeth are actually starting to turn back to a whitish look rather than the coffee stained yellow.

Overall this seems to be a very good router. I set it up with the enclosed CD and everything worked well without a hitch. I plugged in all my network components and the built in switch quickly recognized the devices and assigned IP address via DHCP. 

It has many features including:
*	Access Restrictions which allow you to set up to ten policies which allow you to block services by Web address or by URL, and you can block individual services.
*	Port forwarding capabilities which I have use for Remote Desktop Assistance.
*	Port triggering, DMZ and QoS functions.
*	Firmware upgrades can be performed within the router.
*	Firewall protection.
*	Wireless supports WPA-2 and TKIP/EAS algorithms

There was one item though that I had an issue with, however. When I hooked up my cable modem, the Linksys pulled the WAN information ok. But later, when I switched to phone service with my cable provider and the technician installed their router, the Linksys would not initially pull the WAN information. Even clicking the release and renew buttons didn't work. After about 5 to 10 minutes it pulled the information. A friend of mine also had this problem with the Linksys model WRT54G. In his case, he cannot set the modem to standby; otherwise, he needs to unplug and plug in the router. There seems to be, in some cases, a delay in pulling this information from a cable modem. I'm not sure what's going on here. But once it found the WAN info, everything was fine.

Until I purchased the Furminator, I was brushing my two labrador retrievers everyday during the shedding season, which really took a lot of time.  The furminator pulls out that dead hair, without hurting the dog (however, you must go lightly over the bony prominences; i.e. legs, hips).  If you use the furminator over an area that is not shedding, no hair comes out, so this is proof that it is simply not just cutting any hair away.  I wanted to purchase the larger size for my dogs, but the price is a little high so I stuck with the medium size. If the price were right, the larger size would probably reduce the time spent grooming.  But again, the time necessary with the Furminator during shedding season is only twice per week as opposed to daily.  Well worth the investment!

First I tried the citronella spray collar.  The first day my dog was confused and he did not bark.  By day two, he figured it out and it was no longer a deterent.  By day three, I think he actually liked the spray.
I was initially put off by the "curelty factor" of a shock collar, but something had to be done to curb his barking and calm my angry neighbor.  I have to say, it works just as advertised.  It does not administer a prolonged shock, but instead gives a quick 'sting' followed by a pause that allowes the dog to learn to stop barking.  After 3 days, he only needed the collar when left alone in the yard.  Now, he almost never wears it at all.  This is a very good and very effective training tool, and is in no way some kind of doggie torture device.

This is one of the best de-shedding products currently on the market. I say this as a professional groomer; we use these in our shop. The only reason I give it four stars is because of the weight of it and the handle positioning. Use it for an hour and your wrist will likely be sore. Also, if you brush too long in one spot you risk brush burn (irritation to the skin to the point of redness and possible bleeding if you continue). I'd like to add that used in combination with the furminator shampoo and conditioner the brush time is nearly halved. I'm not kidding, these products are really that good.

The size of this netbook and the ease of getting started (no need to read instructions!) were great. But I had to get used to the keyboard. It's only about an inch narrower than the one on my regular laptop, but the difference is noticeable. The smaller shift keys on both sides were the main culprit behind my typos. Also some of the other keys on the top row are rearranged (like the Delete key). The screen is very sharp and there was no problem reading text without straining my eyes. 

It was a breeze to replace the installed 1GB with 2GB -- remove 2 screws, take off cover, push out the two retaining clips on either side of the 1GB module, take out the 1GB module, put in the 2GB module, press down, replace cover and screws, done! Oh, one more thing. As the computer starts to boot up (and I mean right when it starts to power up) hold down the F2 key to bring up the BIOS. Verify that it sees 2GB of RAM. Then hit F10 to save the configuration. Once booted up, check by right-clicking My Computer, Properties.

The 1000HE comes with StarOffice and Skype pre-installed. StarOffice is pretty good -- I was surprised how easily it read all of my MS Office files. As for Skype, it was version 3.6. The current version is 4.0. Initially I had problems doing a vidcam call until I downloaded 4.0 and installed it (yes, getting connected to the Internet via my home wireless was super easy). Once I did that I found the built-in webcam worked just fine in a video conference call. 

The blue color is very nice, but it's a bit too glossy for my taste. It's a super-magnet for dust and fingerprints. The slip case provided by ASUS is a nice-to-have accessory and fits the computer perfectly. But you'll have to carry the power cord and adapter elsewhere.

Finally, the 1000HE, like all netbooks on the market, does not come with a built-in CD/DVD drive, but I hooked up an external DVD drive and the computer saw it without any problems. So I was able to install other software that way.

My main goals with this netbook was portability and functionality. In particular I wanted something to take on the road to do presentations and maintain on-line communications. So far this little machine has done the job.

Before I bought this, I owned several of the older Kingston Flash Drives with the white top. When I saw this one with the slider bar and no top to worry with, I had to have it. Works great and my data transfers very quickly. The slider is a little stiff, however, the flash drive is still new and hopefully it will loosen up a bit. All in all a well made unit. Highly recommend this one. It beats the SanDisk because there is not USELESS U3 software and this flash drive loads very quickly!

Thank you for reading my review I hope this helps you with your buying decision. I am not an expert with any of the USB Drives. So far I am happy with this unit, but just in case, I bought a second one. 

I just recieved my second 2GB drive the other day. I read the other reviews that talk about failures, so for $5-$10 I bought the second unit to back up the first. It's just a chip, break it open and see, nothing fancy. 

With my second drive I plan on keeping a "back up" of my first drive in case of failure, BACKUP, WHAT A GREAT IDEA. I use mine for storing pictures, documents and videos that I want/need to save in order to unclutter my email inbox.

SPEED - I don't have a "GEEK" way of measuring the data transfer speed but the Kingston units seam to work faster than my other "standard" USB drives that I own. "Selling the old ones soon, :)"

PHYSICAL SIZE - The Kingston USB Drives are smaller than my other USB Drives and the Kingston Data traveler has 2 clips for lanyards if that is important to you. (I always break my lanyard clips, so I have stopped using them) 
  
VALUE - Google them, click the SHOPPING button on the top of the google page and see for yourself. Maybe you'll have my price beat.

I must have bought one of just about every powered, USB 2.0 hub on the shelf at Fry's and returned them, one by one, because I wasn't happy with them for one reason or another. Besides those criteria, I was looking for a hub that has both the power jack and USB upstream jack on the same surface of the housing, because I hated the ones  that are small, but take up a big footprint on your desk because they have plugs sticking out of them on 3 or 4 sides. 

While the CP-H720P does not meet this criteria, it uses that fact as an advantage. First, the housing can be mounted vertically in a weighted stand (provided) to minimize footprint. Then, it has USB downstream ports on both a forward and rearward facing edges, so that plugs for long term connections can attach to the back of the hub and the cables route out of the way, and plugs for temporary connections face forward for easy access. Arranged this way, the power and upstream plugs don't get in the way. But the best feature is the seventh port, on the face of the housing, which is great for frequently accessed flash drives.

On the down side, not so much. The power light is an intense blue LED that lights up my workspace when the lights are off. There are additional less-spectacular green LEDs for each of the downstream ports, but to my dismay, they are not activity indicators but power overload indicators, so they don't normally light up at all.

On the whole, I am very satisfied with this unit. It's a "keeper".

This is the best appliance to have in your kitchen.  Always wanted one but thought it was too cost prohibitive, until I found it on Amazon.  No other Stand Mixer can compare.  It can do everything but read your recipe.  Did not take me long to get used to and now I feel I cannot get along with it.  Everything from Pound Cake to Sausage balls is now made with this mixer.  No more aching neck and hands from trying to stir heavy cookie dough, breads or the sausage balls.  This Stand Mixer makes it all a cinch.  I used it heavily through the holidays.  It saved so much time and stopped the aching muscles that I cooked and baked even more than usual.  No kitchen is complete without one!!!!!  It is also an attractive kitchen addition.  I also ordered the cover for it and of course I use it, but it is also a shame to cover it up.  You will need to find a place to put it and leave it.  It is heavy.  Looks and feels like how things used to be made to last.

Sigh, the last book, it's very bittersweet when you get to page 754, but when i closed the book, i knew that  there could NOT have been a better ending to this brilliant saga, it was truly prefect. Throughout the first three books, Bella was a very different person from who i see her as now, this book shows you this whole other layer to her, not to mention she finally gets a backbone. Also i find myself actually liking Jacob, (i was always pretty sure that would never happen). There are so many twists and emotional roller coasters in this book, you really feel every heartbreak and sacrifice the characters do. It's utterly amazing how Meyers came about writing Twilight in the first place, but i think it's even more amazing how she managed to end it. Bravo Stephenie, you did it!

Eight months after introducing two new kittens into my house, one of my two older cats was still on the warpath -- hissing, spitting, growling, and attacking the now-not-so-newcomers at every opportunity. She was unhappy, and I was miserable. My vet recommended feline facial pheromones, and after reading all the positive reviews on this site, I decided to try them. Six weeks into the experiment, they seem to be working. The change didn't come overnight, as some reviews suggested it would, but the attacks have ceased completely, we hear only the occasional hiss, and it looks like the warring parties may eventually sign a peace treaty. The stuff is expensive, yes -- but what is your sanity (and the happiness of your kitties) worth to you? 

In all fairness, I should note that my older cat is also taking vet-prescribed Prozac, which she started a few days before the Feliway arrived, but I've noticed changes in the other three cats as well that I can only attribute to the Feliway. In particular, the reclusive kitten has become much more sociable and willing to be petted, and that's a welcome change.

Go ahead and give this stuff a try. I'm on my second set of refills and will in all likelihood keep using it.

If you loved Twilight, then you will have a love/hate relationship with this book! Not to give too much away, but Edward is absent through most of the book, and you see Bella in a really dark place. Though the book was a great read, I bawled like a baby through out it. It is still an asset to the Twilight saga, and definitely sets the premise for the continuing books. It is this book that really makes you appreciate the love story, because you cant fully appreciate the good times without experiencing the bad times!

Tricky to rate a Bond movie for all the opinions out there for what a Bond movie should be. Ever since CASINO ROYALE (the DANIEL CRAIG version), I've been interested in the New James Bond as I like to call him. I fully understand the loyalty by fans to all of the previous 007 outings. However since the restructuring of the franchise in 2006, I find the character traits given to Craig's secret agent are way more compelling than the tired old 'who's the best Bond?'. This review is (as all of my reviews are) based solely on my outlook of a biased cinematical viewpoint. That viewpoint is this; all Bonds before Craig are somewhat the same. 
Purists scoff. 
Fans sneer. 
S'okay. 
Say what you will, but I've never, in any previous BOND flick, FELT Bond's motivation until the last 3/4 of CASINO ROYALE. QUANTUM is no different. Only when Craig's 007 says that there was nothing emotional betwixt Vespa and himself to M when this film kicks off, you realise how much there was for HIM with Vespa. He blames himself for her death. Giving Craig's Bond a dimension only merely mentioned in previous BOND outings. They have re-invented this character, people, Q ain't showing up. 
The action in this movie is relentless. The stunts are excellent. In the first half hour there are four sequences worthy of climactic battle in most big screen pics. There is very little story, however the machine that QUANTUM is, it's not needed. I thought the action was well lensed and intense. JASON BORNE is not as cool, nor filmed with the ferocity, as Craig's Bond by a long shot. As far as I'm concerned, Craig IS Bond. All memory has been wiped of what were decent, if cheesy, movies. 
This is different. This is new. And I love it. 
It would be easy to watch CASINO and QUANTUM back to back. They flow right together. The continuation is another plus to Bond's new feel. 
QUANATUM OF SOLACE is a necessary installment of the new Bond. Wrapping up a story line in the series and paving the way for many interesting new adventures, Bond truly finds, at the finale of the film, a quantum of solace.

"Slumdog Millionaire" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: The story of Jamal Malik, an 18 year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai, who is about to experience the biggest day of his life. With the whole nation watching, he is just one question away from winning a staggering 20 million rupees on India's "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?" But when the show breaks for the night, police arrest him on suspicion of cheating; how could a street kid know so much? Desperate to prove his innocence, Jamal tells the story of his life in the slum where he and his brother grew up, of their adventures together on the road, of vicious encounters with local gangs, and of Latika, the girl he loved and lost. Each chapter of his story reveals the key to the answer to one of the game show's questions. Intrigued by Jamal's story, the jaded Police Inspector begins to wonder what a young man with no apparent desire for riches is really doing on this game show? When the new day dawns and Jamal returns to answer the final question, the Inspector and sixty million viewers are about to find out...

The (Oscar-nominated) cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle (who also did the cinematography to Boyle's "28 Days Later..." & "Millions") is excellent! The (Oscar-nominated) film editing by Chris Dickens (who also did the film editing to "Shaun Of The Dead" (2004) & "Hot Fuzz" (2007) is brilliant! The casting by Gail Stevens (who also been doing the casting to Boyle's films since "Trainspotting", except "A Life Less Ordinary") & Loveleen Tandan is excellent! The production design by Mark Digby (who was an supervising art director on "28 Days Later..." & "Millions" is excellent! The set decoration by Michelle Day (who was an art department assistant on "28 Days Later..." & did the set decoration to "Millions", "Sunshine" & "28 Weeks Later" (2007, which Boyle executive produced) is excellent! The costume design by Suttirat Anne Larlarb (who also did the costume design to "Sunshine") is excellent!

This is an brilliant drama that is unlike anything you have seen this year or last year, actually. This is Danny Boyle's best film of his career, thus far. This is one of the best films of last year.

I purchased my Zen about a month ago and have been able to use it for movies and music.  The sound quality, even with plain factory earphones, is awesome and the picture for movies is great considering it's a 2.5" screen.  I was able to put 6 full length movies and about 200 songs on it for a business trip and there was still almost 2GB left.  Amazon definitely has the best price on this product, and the best customer service.  This is a fun little gadget and perfect for summer trips!

I love these diapers! I was a steady Huggies brand buyer until I got a gift certificate to for Seventh Generation diapers. So far I've only used stage 4 on my son but I love them. They are just as good as the diapers I was so attached to. Highly recommend them.

Even after reading several reviews, I was still skeptical that my cats (both of them sink drinkers for 3 years) would switch over.  My husband and I were worried about the amount of water they were getting, since we were not home during the day to give them fresh water and they would *not* drink from their bowl.  One week after purchasing the waterer, both cats were drinking from the fountain like they had their entire lives.  Training was relatively easy as well, we would just pick them up from the sink and take them to the waterer each time they jumped up on the counter.  The unit is very quiet and simple to assemble, also seems easy to clean so far.  Well worth the money, plus it is cheaper on Amazon.com than some other sites I found.

I would first like to thank Amazon.com for giving me the chance to buy this KitchenAid Pro 600 for the price of 79 dollars after rebate. Secondly I would like to thank KitchenAid Customer Service for being just superb. I called them to inquire about whether my stand mixer had a plastic or metal gearbox casing, and the customer service woman told me  that all mixers manufactured after April of 2007 had the metal gearbox case, and mine was manufactured in August of this year (2007). Then I inquired about the flat beater which was received with a deep scratch through the burnished surface. The Customer Service Woman gave me the choice of a white coated beater or another burnished aluminum beater, and she mentioned that she preferred the white beaters cause they are dishwasher safe. Furthermore she explained that Kitchenaid does not offer stainless steel in order to keep cost down. I opted for the white beater which should be here in about 5 to 7 days. 
As far as the mixer itself, I have yet to really use it. But I should be getting some pans soon which will border its use. But I did give it a test run, and I was quite surprised at the lack of noise. I would say for a kitchen appliance, it was rather quiet. Sure its slightly louder than say a hand mixer but not much, and it is much quieter than any blender, I have ever used. Obviously I am not a chef or highly experienced cook, but I do enjoying cooking. In fact the stand mixer will be getting its first use tonight, so I got to go and start making dinner. 

Thanks Again Amazon

I fell in love with this computer -- mine is the Z570N/B -- as soon as I laid eyes on it. Turning it on and having a look only made it more appealing. The LCD quality is outstanding (a definite deal maker for me, because I needed a portable for photo editing); the keyboard is the best I've ever used on a laptop, very comfortable, spacious and not spongy at all; sound quality is better than expected for a portable. I also liked the design, very sleek and classy, with very good materials, and the overall impression of quality build. Other plusses were the HDMI and firewire ports, and the built-in Bluetooth and wireless (almost a given nowadays, but you never know).

So, yes, I took this little machine home with me. I am still impressed with its speed (great processor and lots of RAM) in any operation, and again, the quality of its 13.1" screen. So far it seems like the perfect laptop for my needs. I've yet to test other capabilities, like wireless and DVD burning.

As for Windows Vista Business, well, I knew what I was getting into when I bought this machine. I knew, for instance, that I hated Vista and wanted nothing to do with it. I also knew that I was eligible for the downgrade DVD because it's Vista Business, and that Sony didn't ship it with this product. I'll burn the Restore DVDs just in case... I'm waiting for Sony to send me the XP Pro downgrade DVD, which I've already ordered, and am hoping the company comes through in its promise to deliver. Otherwise, I'll have to download the XP drivers one by one and do a fresh XP install. I don't love this idea, but I love Vista even less. And I'm definitely NOT going to let the OS spoil a fantastic machine for me.

* November 2008 update. Sony shipped the XP downgrade DVDs within two days of my request (you have to fill out an online form at the Sony support site, with a valid USA address) but unfortunately I wasn't here to receive it. Now I am, and have downgraded that despicable Vista to XP SP3. Guess what? It worked with zero hassle, completing the process in less than 2 hours. All you have to do is insert and remove DVDs when requested. I now have this laptop running on XP and everything is working just fine (the Sony DVDs DO include all the drivers). If it was already very fast on Vista, imagine on XP... I use it on Speed mode -- so as to enjoy all the benefits of the NVidia video card -- and wireless, and as I write battery life has been almost 2.5 hours, with a bit more to go.

I am very happy to say that Sony came through promptly and efficiently, and that I now have this laptop just the way I wanted it. Best of all, Windows One Care and most of the Windows and Vaio junk do NOT get loaded on the computer when you downgrade. I am using Norton Antivirus 2009 and Zone Alarm Pro firewall (which I downloaded at a discount by renewing a subscription I already had), so you can count on spending a little extra to make the computer as safe as possible from all the threats out there.

One word of advice: as soon as I got this laptop, I partitioned the hard drive under Vista and placed lots of files in other partitions. My reasoning was that, since the downgrade would only erase the C: drive and everything in it, the files in the other partitions would be safe. However, the downgrade will only be carried out if it can access and erase all the Vista partitions. This meant I had to copy all my files into an external hard drive before doing the downgrade. Once the Vaio was running on XP, I re-partitioned the hard drive and copied all the files back. This was unexpected, but then I figured that Microsoft being what Microsoft is, of course Vista partitions wouldn't work on XP... Just a minor setback, and one that doesn't detract at all from the 5-star experience the Sony Vaio Z570N/B is being for me.

I finally gave up on my ancient set of yogurt jars when I broke too many of them. They weren't the greatest, and they didn't give foolproof results, but they DID give me fresh and inexpensive yogurt. Most of the time. 
I was a little leery of the new Salton system because it didn't use the little cups, but I figured I could just put the finished yogurt in some recycled marg containers. I was right; the one-quart system works smoothly and effortlessly. You have yogurt  in the space of a day with a minimum expenditure of time and energy, and the yogurt is simply superb. 
You heat up a quart of milk to the scalding point, then cool it back down to 110. you add some yogurt starter and put it into the heater for five hours. The system essentially consists of a heater jacket  and a plastic bucket that keeps the working yogurt at the right heat, until you cool it and put it in the fridge. The heater is beautifully designed to be simple and efficient. It is easy to wash and looks like it will last forever. 
The system comes with very complete and totally clear instructions that tell you what NOT to do as well as what TO do. I cannot imagine how anything could be easier than this process! And you gotta love the price. You should definitely buy a spot thermometer for monitoring the running-in temperatures, but you will have everything else you need in your kitchen already.

The coffee itself is good, but the mechanics of loading and preparing can be a challenge.  The carafe must be carefully placed so that the coffee flows directly through its lid.  The tight fit between the basket and the heating pad can cause inattentive brewers to allow the coffee to flow off the lid instead of into the carafe.  This happened on our second pot and caused the clock to malfunction and spurred an exchange.  Also, the reservoir lid cannot be completely opened without moving it from under the cupboard when filling it with water.  A minor inconvenience, but an awkward, extra motion that  further complicates what should be an easy  process.  If the machine will be placed under a cupboard, check the height of the 10-cup model, which might make for a better fit.

I've used electric razors, the 4-bladed Schick Quattro, as well as the really cheap 1-bladed throwaway kind. None work better than these. At the price of about a dollar a blade, they are very so worth it.

This movie was amazing. Take an lonely little robot and send him on an  adventure of a lifetime and you you have Pixar's newest hit WALL-E: the story of a waste management robot who will win you over with his lovable demeanor.

WALL-E's been left on Earth for over 700 years to clean up the mess humanity has left behind. One day he encounters EVE, a sleek robot who returns to Earth as part of a survey mission to see if the planet is ready to recolonize. When EVE abruptly dissapears, its up to WALL-E to go in search of her. As you watch the little guy overcome many obstacles to find his new love interest he will win you over with his persistance. 

This movie was a real treat and should be enjoyed by all ages.

First let me start by saying I was a little skeptical of ice cream makers. The ones we had when we were kids required dry ice and lots of time, neither of which I have.  This is the best though.  The ice cream is so good and really easy.  I've only had this ice cream maker 4 days and I've already made vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream and peach frozen yogurt and each one is delicious.  It makes the perfect amount for a family, not too much so you're sick of it before it's gone or too little.  And it's so easy.  Basically you just pour the ingredients in while it's mixing and in 30 minutes you have ice cream.

Is it me, or is Turbo Tax getting a little more arduous to use.  I guess what I mean is that - when you have trouble, or there is a question about some issue, finding the answer isn't particularly easy.  Maybe it's me - I don't know.  I've used Turbo Tax for about ten years now, and it seems as if they make it a little more difficult every year (considering not much has changed for me in the last 10 years).  I did use the on-line "chat" to answer one question - and that was cool.  And I loved the eFile.  First time I ever used that feature.  Got my refund back in about two weeks.  Otherwise, it's Turbo Tax as ususal.

I've been using my Omron HJ-112 pedometer now for several months.  What is wonderful about this product is that you can just slip it in your pants pocket.

The only downside is I wish it kept track of minutes.  It does not do that for you.  I highly recommend this product.  You will not be disappointed.

My 13 year old arthritic hound loves his Coolaroo bed so much that I bought him a second one for inside the house.  I put his old pillow-type dog bed on top of the indoor Coolaroo, and he sleeps very comfortably.  I assume the sling-type bedding takes some of the pressure off of his sore joints.  This is a pretty big bed, and it's not beautiful to look at, but it makes him happy.  I'm giving 4 stars because the Coolaroo can be hard to put together. (When it's new out of the box the fabric is VERY tight, so you have to sort of twist the pieces together.)

I have many different brands of MP3 players, and I got this one solely for songs that I downloaded off of iTunes (that I couldn't find anywhere else.) It certainly suits that purpose. I am not a runner, but I can certainly see how this size and the clip on the back would be great for that. However, if you don't got to the gym, and you're the "I want to hear YMCA right now!" type of person, you're probably better off with a larger iPod or a different brand of player that has a menu function.

Making pancakes, french toast and bacon is an ease with the Presto 22 inch griddle.  It is the perfect size for a family of four. I would not call it Jumbo.  The heating is even throughout but I do need to set the heat lower than the recipe instructions, for example if the recipe calls for 375 degrees, I use 300 degrees. For pancakes there is no need for using oil since the non-stick is really non-stick.  I have only had the grill about 1 month but so far it's the best grill I have ever owned.  I look forward to making breakfast now since I know it will only take 10 minutes!

I have had this feeder for about 1.5 years now (original version).  Still running on the original batteries.  The clock does tend to drift off on a regular basis, but nothing that throws it off too much.  I feed two cats twice a day.

Pros:
 - Big kitty gets a little better portion control
 - Neither kitty wakes me up at 6AM wanting food
 - We can go on vacation without concern the big kitty will eat 4 days of food in an hour
 - I work late a lot so no worries about the cats not being fed

Cons:
 - Programming not obvious
 - Clock drifts
 - Feeds a bit too much on the lowest setting
 - Big kitty paws at it to drop more food (fixed with a piece of tape)
 - Not easy to clean

I ended up putting a piece of paper in the middle over the paddle wheel to limit the amount of food entering.  I also put another piece of paper and tape on the outlet to stop the big kitty from pawing for food.  This device is without a doubt far from perfect, but worth the investment for sure.  When that motor starts turning the big and little kitty go running for their food.

I purchased two of these.  One for me and my wife and once you get the stride setting dialed in it is very accurate.  It tracks aerobic steps and regular steps plus it logs miles and calories burned.  The software that tracks your progress is well worth the extra price too.  Highly recommended!

I purchased this for my husband for Xmas.  We both have the bigger model at our workplaces.  We love it.  Yes it vibrates the counter a bit when it's refilling the pump...but who cares!  We have a variety of k-cups, coffee, tea, and cocoa. They are all good.  I brew a travel cup of coffee every morning for myself.  Its so nice to be able to pop a kcup in, brew and go!  I highly recommend this product.

I wanted a second computer for quite sometime now. Actually this was brought on by the launch of the macbook air. In the ad it seemed sooooo cool! But since its also pricey, I decided to research first on its pros and cons. In the process of doing that I tumbled across on the specs for the Apple Macbook. If you compare the air to it, performance-wise the Macbook is the way to go. For the air, you have to buy the cd reader peripheral, sure you can access via remote drive but can you do that on a plane? So if you think about it the only thing awesome with the air is its weight. The macbook is not that heavy if you think about it.

So, I finally decided to go with the Macbook. I was hesitant at first because I've been a PC user since I could remember. I thought it will be a HUGE change. Its user friendly, so its easy to adapt. You just have to explore what it can do, and with time machine, you really don't have to worry if you accidentally erase something. Sure, maybe some of the game software available is limited but you don't really buy a laptop primarily to play. 

I would definitely recommend this laptop.

I need a computer to bring from work to home everyday and want to be compact and light weight. I found this Acer Aspire One online which is priced lower than my budget (for once). I figure as long as it can manage to run Word and Excel I am OK. Three weeks ago I received it from Amazon. I am suprise not only I can run the Office; it handles Photoshop, Illustrator too. It turns on and off faster than my old VAIO. 6 cell battery last 6 hours, very well made and finish.  

Cons: noisy fan, bottons on both side of touch pad are hard to press. I end up turn off touch pad and using external mouse all the time.

10 Episodes is just fine! It was a fabulous idea to release half the season in time for Xmas! We don't have/need cable television, so we haven't seen any of these! We will be buying this for all our friends (40 copies!!!) this Christmas to encourage this type of thing. All the trainspotters can wait if they want! We're getting it now! Ha.

This model works as well as or better than an earlier one for which I bought this as a replacement (the older battery would no longer hold a charge). The length control works perfectly well (I don't know why some referred to unexpected changes in that regard. It does not change unless you choose to do so). Some complained about the noise level. No, it won't make you deaf--it will just remind you of the need for recharging.

This was very easy to set up and get operational, and it has not caused me any problems at all.  As mentioned in some other reviews, the blue LED is quite bright, but my daughters thought it was "cool"....we all got used to it quickly.  It wasn't clear from the description, but I was pleased that it came with a nice, long (6-ft) USB cable so I didn't need to buy that separately.

This show just gets better and better. Dexter is sweating bullets thru most of the second season because they have discovered all the bodies he has cut up and dumped in the ocean. The FBI has put together a task force to find the killer (Dexter) and it's a game of cat and mouse for most of shows. Keith Carradine is in most of the shows and although Dexter thinks he suspects him, the FBI agent just likes his opinions. Yes, that is the way it is with Dexter. Just when he thinks he is suspected, he finds the people mostly just respect him and want to know what he thinks. In other words, he always escapes punishment just when you think he is going to get caught. His love life is picking up speed too but then Rita thinks he has been cheating on her and dumps him. He starts an affair then with a sociopath and the tension rides high for the entire season. No matter what he does, we his fans are making excuses for any bad behavior on his part. He kills the serial killers because the courts can't convict them or find them. He doesn't cheat on his girlfriend until after she has broken up with him (he's silly enough to think when she says it's over that it's really over) and that is when he sleeps with the sociopath. Deb, his sister sets him straight. See what I mean...we should be hoping this serial killer gets caught...instead I am making excuses for him at every turn just like his girlfriend and foster sister Deb. Yes, there is something about Dexter that makes you want to turn him into a good guy, but if that happened, what would the show be about! The show has its humorous moments and it's just great! You can watch seasons 1 and 2 from netflix and season 3 from video on demand from amazon or direct tv if you don't want to buy the discs.

I wanted a nice-looking basic, easy to operate microwave and this fills the bill. Price was unbeatable. It is powerful, easy to operate, and has some nice features like the "Popcorn" button, and the "Minute Plus". It looks good too, altho it is not really small or compact. The only downside is the rather tinny sound to the door when you shut it, but everything else is great and I am very happy with this product. I've had SHARP microwaves before and they have always performed extremely well. Highly recommend if you want a basic microwave that looks nice.

I've already mentioned my tenuous link to the Dexter crew in my review of Season One, so I'll just skip to why I love this show so much: because it's fearless.

This season takes many of the established tropes that make Dexter's life (Michael C. Hall) as a vigilante/serial killer plausible and tosses them out the window.  Everything that was a minor annoyance in the first season is amped up to 11. Dexter's dumping ground for corpses, a quaint little spot in the ocean that nobody ever noticed, gets noticed.  Officer Doakes (Erik King), who was openly hostile to Dexter, becomes a very real threat.  Harry's Code, which keeps Dexter on the mostly-straight and somewhat-narrow path, comes into question. LaGuerta (Lauren Velez) stoops to new lows to get her old job back.  And Dexter's sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), who was always annoying to begin with, moves in with him to become even more annoying. 

The show doesn't forget its past.  Debra is traumatized by the fact that she almost married a serial killer; the characters regularly forget the incident and stumble over apologies as they make insensitive remarks. Dexter greatly misses his serial-killer brother, the only person who understood him.  Until he finds a new soul mate: Lila (Jaime Murray).

Lila seems to rub a lot of people the wrong way (or the right way, if you like brunettes).  She's gorgeous in a goth fashion, completely uninhibited, and madly in love with the Dexter she doesn't see. She's also a complete loon.  All these attributes make her a perfect fit for Dexter...except Dexter is very much a family man, a killer who would never harm children, who despite his violent excesses surrounds himself with the trappings of family.  Lila throws in sharp relief what vestiges of Dexter's personality are decent, and as such she's a perfect foil for season 2.

The other breakout character is Doakes.  Once Doakes unearths Dexter's past, the two come to an understanding.  Throughout the season are philosophical arguments that detail each man's past in a game of one-upmanship.  Who is worse: the special ops soldier who murders people he's ordered to kill, or the vigilante who uses free will to determine whom he executes? We don't get a clear answer, only more questions.

There are some entertaining nods to the field of serial killer investigation.  Don Foster (Author Unknown: On the Trail of Anonymous) gets a shout-out...and is soundly, brutally mocked for his language analysis, sorry Don. So does Bob Ressler (Whoever Fights Monsters) in the form of Special Agent Frank Lundy (Keith Carradine). An awkward but believable subplot develops between Lundy and Debra, just further exemplifying that none of Dexter's heroes are one-dimensional, but fully developed and all too humanly flawed. 

We tore through this season on our Netflix list, clearing out our queue to ensure we could watch all the DVDs back to back.  The show is that good.

We had "struggled" with automatic kitty boxes for years. We'd be woken up in middle of the night with motor straining through litter.  I'd have to buy the best litter to have a chance of it working. I'm SOOO glad that those days are gone. 
I'm very pleased with large Omega Paw. It is easy, fast and minimizes odor well. I was concerned that my cats may not use it but my large cat crawled into it before I even got it out of the box!  I've had no problems with the clips or the drawer.  When you turn it over, make sure that the door is pushed in all the way so no litter escapes. Any clumping litter seems to work fine.  World's Best Litter Original is still the best but other cheaper brands work just fine!

This is a great product unless your dog is as determined as mine!  My little Shih-tzu was quite shocked by this when he first had it on. (Quite amusing to watch!)  The first few days it worked great, but then he just decided to bark through it after he realized it was annoying but not harmful! But it was worth a shot over the anti-barking alternatives.

I fell in love with this series, well... last week; which was perfect because I didn't have to wait long for Eclipse. The author has really captured the essence of "teen" angst and love with humor and realism (well, as real as a book about vampires and werewolves can be). This story gives us some much-needed back story without weighing the book down too much and takes the romance level up to PG-13.  She really gives Bella, some important things to think about before deciding on her mortality which I really enjoyed.  Why 4 stars?  Well, I felt that Jacob's character was not true to who he was set up to be in the first and second tomes. I was especially bothered by the "mind games" he played because they are unhealthy and so harmful to any relationship; especially a best-friend/love.  And yet, our heroine is not as angry as she should be and is even drawn in by them.  I felt that this turn of events undermined the whole "soul-mate" Edward issue and made Bella seem shallow and easily swayed.  That said, I am eagerly awaiting the final volume in Bella's saga and am firmly planted in the Edward camp!! I would highly recommend this series to teens and adults alike. It would make a fantastic book group choice as there are a lot of meaty issues that can be found within its many pages.  Have fun reading!

We have two and use them to help our kids sleep in a noisy household. They work great! We tried CD's and electronic noise generators but they all seem be sound loops and not pure white noise. If you listen long enough, you can hear a pattern/rythm. Very annoying. These are mechanical with an internal fan and vents that create the white noise. No sound loop, pattern or rythm to annoy. Two speeds, easy to adjust. We recommend them over any electronic alternative.

As many other consumers have pointed out, there are still fees for e-filing that you will need to pay on top of the cost of the product. But what you're buying here is a piece of software that reduces the amount of time that you would otherwise spend checking and double-checking figures, manually entering your W-4s, etc. It practically takes all the "fun" out of tax preparation! Despite the additional cost of e-filing (and another fee for state e-filing), TurboTax Deluxe Federal and State is well worth its retail price.

And, for what it's worth, I have Mac OS 10.4 and didn't encounter any problems with the software, besides the time-consuming download of updates when I first started the program.

I have done my homework looking for a hand blender and ended up buying CSB-77. It works better then I expected. I didn't think I'd use the attachments since I already have a mini chopper and a full size food processor, but I was wrong. The chopper is great for small jobs like an onion, a garlic clove, herbs or chocolate. The whisk ended up being "a must" - I use it to make whip cream for just the two servings of dessert I often need. I love the fact that all parts are detachable and dishwasher safe, and you can buy extra and/or replacement parts separately (not the case with some other vendors). I am very happy with this purchase, would recommend it to anyone.

I bought the Cuisinart DCC-1200BW coffee maker because Consumer Reports rated it above all others. It makes great coffee and I like the controls being on top rather than on the bottom like my old Krups that just gave up after about 15 years. I like the fact that it has a temp control for the carafe. It also beeps 5 times when the coffee is ready to drink. It will beep 3 times when it does an auto-shut-off. The auto-shut-off feature is programmable for the amount of time between brewing and shut off. It is disabled by default.
Two minuses: There is no outside water view, so if you can't remember if you put water in it, you have to lift the lid and look inside. There's a scale in there, so you can see how much water is in it. Number 2 is the LCD time display - it is a little small and an LED display would be easier to read.
After buying it, I noticed that Charlie Sheen has the same coffee maker in his kitchen on "Two And A Half Men".

John Adams (the book) is an intriguing work about a fascinating man and it was a true pleasure to read. This HBO miniseries, in my opinion, is a superb adaptation of the book. For anyone who is interested in rare quotes from John Adams concerning his thoughts on the interrelationship between religion and public virtue, I would recommend another book that I have recently read entitled God of Our Fathers: Advice and Prayers of Our Nation's Founders  Quotes from his cousin Samuel and from Franklin, Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and other of the Founding Fathers are contained therein as well.

My first purchase was a silver CAXE3701T0.  I've owned it for about 2 months and am using it with a Tivo HD.  About a month ago, I purchased the black CAXM3701T0.  Both units are relatively quiet.  Both boxes feel barely warm to the touch.  Both have an on/off switch.  I have not opened the enclosure, but I've read that others have confirmed the silver model has a Western Digital drive.  The only difference that I have noticed is the black enclosure is 9" long and the silver is only 8" long.  I have not had any issues with either drive reading/writing 24x7 with my Tivo units.

One note for Tivo HD owners.  This unit is "plug and play" for the Tivo HD series 3 with the larger internal hard drive.  But the Tivo HD model without the series 3 in the description (TivoHD) and smaller internal hard drive, it requires opening the Tivo unit, temporarily attaching the internal and external Cavalry drive to a PC, running a quick program to pair the two drives, and then putting everything back together.  You can find the instructions on the tivocommunity dot com forums by searching for "external tivo storage".  From start to finish, it should take most people less than 30 minutes to complete.

This gate was the tallest available at our local Babies R Us store. That's really the best thing going here. Our two chihuahuas are now safely kept away from our living room furniture.

I like that the gate has vertical bars instead of any sort of mesh. Also, I don't see too much of a problem with noise. All in all, this gate works because it seems as though it's the tallest one out there.

Being new to the graphic novel genre, I focused more heavily on the words than the images.  The story is compelling, dark and very well written.  The images enhance the message and help give "life" to the words.  An excellent read whether you are a super hero fan or a fan of top flight literature that happens to be about super heroes.

This review is from: Iron Man [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)

      



Now here's one for the collection.  Robert Downey Jr. shines, and is perfect for the role of Tony Stark.  Robert Downey Jr. has been around for some time, but this movie has catapulted him into superstardom.

I am a big fan of superhero movies, and strongly believe that this one delivered.  I am looking forward to owning it on DVD.  There was really nothing to complain about for me.  It was really tight.  No plot holes, no cheesy moments, no cgi flaws, everything was there and in perfect proportion throughout.  Had they tried to pull off this movie decades ago, it may have fallen short, but modern special effects are at work here, and the designers do quite a fine job with this film.  Notable is the amazing detail on the intricate body armor and electronic systems of the suit.  You really believe that the suit (Stark's invention) is formidable and ultra high tech.  There is plenty of action, and some unbelievably cool moments that will have you hitting the rewind button, or watching the whole movie again soon.  I give it a full five stars.  Enjoy!

Tip on buying the mini dvd's: we purchased the Memorex Mini DVD+RW 10 Pack and they did not work with this camcorder. We know that the sony mini dvd's do work.  We called sony and they said it was something about how the memorex dvds are made is why they do not work.

This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [HD DVD] (HD DVD)

      



The Planet Earth BBC version is obviously spectacular as for the visual effects, camera angles etc.. The dvd is good olde fashioned family entertainment a sorta "Wild Kingdom" on steroids. The dvd can get quite repetitive with the camera angles and after the first dvd you tend to know what to expect. The dvd definitely has its distinct presentation style. I would have given the dvd FIVE stars but I must admit due to the repetitive nature of the technical camera work I found myself getting bored at some points. However, in defense of Planet Earth I am one who gets bored with 95% of the movies I watch (lack of sleep). Overall Planet Earth BBC version is a wonderful family event and is worthy of your dvd collection.

I've just purchased this netbook weeks ago for personal and school work use. I'm very much satisfied and happy about my decision purchasing a 6-cell-batt, pink Aspire One netbook. The finish is elegant and performance is great. Given the speedy boot-up, web browsing and net conferencing, this very lightweight and small size computer gives me the same service as my desktop computer and much more, not to mention the huge hd space and that i can take it with me wherever i go. I got used to the screen and keyboard instantly, even touch-typing is never a problem to me. I just love everything about my beautiful pink and CUTE computer.

I recently set up this wireless card for a relative, and was pleasantly surprised by how quickly and smoothly the entire process went. It was probably the simplest hardware upgrade I've ever done.

Upon receiving the package, I panicked for a moment when I noticed the PC was a slim form-factor Dell. Obviously the card wouldn't fit in that case because the back plate would be too big. Luckily for me, and very thoughtful of MSI, this wireless card has removable back plates and it even includes a slim one just for this case! If you're interested, it also includes an even smaller one, probably for microATX cases, for a total of 3 plates. Very handy.

What followed was me getting my Philips screwdriver, replacing the back plate on the card, opening the computer case, inserting the card and closing everything up. Then I attached the included antenna, hooked everything back up and booted into Vista Home Basic SP1. At this point I have to mention I previously made sure to download the updated drivers from MSI's site and have them ready before I installed the card. Windows promptly asked me for the drivers, I pointed the installer to the right location, and off it went. IIRC, I believe the drivers were WHQL signed (someone correct me if I'm wrong), which is always a reassuring thing that at least these specific drivers should not crash your system.

And that was it. The card provided the computer with full 802.11g speeds and a 100% signal to a Netgear WGR614v6 AP, through several rooms and walls apart. Needless to say, I was browsing the web in no time.

In conclusion, it was a pleasure setting this up, and I haven't had any complaints whatsoever since (2+ months now).

I have nothing bad to say about this product. It has plenty of features and accessories, installation is a breeze, great performer, Vista compatible, and best of all, the price is right. I wasn't a big fan of MSI before, having had so-so experiences with their motherboards, but this has certainly made me reconsider them in all my computer purchases from now on.

Highly recommended.

Ok, this is the first tax software I've tried. Up until now I stuck with books, PDF forms and a BIG bottle of tylenol. I just finished my return and e-filed it, and I have to say this was the easiest round of taxes yet.

The pros - the initial interview questions seemed to hit everything needed to get most of the info done before hitting the returns. While answering questions TaxCut offered tips and explainations for everyting. If the explaination didn't show the help or explaination link helped figure things out. Overall the the process was pretty painless and was finished rather quickly.

The cons - You have to know a little about your returns for the error checking part. There might be something that needs verifying or an error to correct. If your not familiar with your returns the area that needs adjusting could be strange or confusing. The other is the begining interview questions. While they are complete if your not use to tax software the order of questions can be confusing. Best advise just stick with it and all will be well.

I'd recommend this product to others to use, it worked for me.  Granted my return doesn't do a lot of deduction actrobatics (I have wages, mortgage, student loan interest, savings interest and a divident to contend with). If your return is really complicated I'd say take it to someone...besides that complicated and you probably can afford to do so!...LOL

I bought this to install inside of a home control panel in our closet - so we had limited space. This was the switch with the smallest profile I could find and the metal case is great for heat dissipation without a noisy fan. 

The only thing that would have made this thing more perfect was to have a power adapter with a power plug that is angled instead of straight. Having a straight plug effectively makes the switch almost 1 inch deeper.

If you plan to only monitor and track one person I would buy this wrist cuff over the arm cuff.  I have both and found the accuracy the same (wrist at work & arm at home).  The wrist cuff is far easier to use and store, it does however only track a single user.  To automatically track and download two individual users you will need this arm unit.

This is an excellent wireless router. We have it connected to our desktop and it works great with our Nintendo Wii. It also works great with notebooks with wireless adapters. It's password protected so the neighbors can't steal your bandwidth. The only problem with it is that it cuts out sometimes, not often, for no apparent reason, but I found that if I talk on the cordless phone (2.4 GHz) near it or walk around using the phone, it will sometimes cut out so maybe that's the reason. When this happens I just turn it off and back on again and it resets.

I looked at a few laptops online before deciding on this one.  What won me over is the almost full size keyboard and battery life.  I am extremely happy with this netbook.  It is my take everywhere netbook around the house and weekend trips.  After the first weekend, I had no problem parting with my regular sized laptop (15.4" screen) when taking off for the weekend.  I have two teenage kids, and this a great size for taking notes in the car resting on a big text book.  The other laptop would have been too big and difficult to work with in the car.  Its sleep and hibernate function work great and it boots up from these states quickly and without a problem.  I was hesitant on getting blue, hearing about finger prints and wondering if it was too "cheap" looking.  But I'll have to say, I love the blue from the moment I got it.  Yes, you'll see fingerprints - but not enough to even bother me at all.  The only possible negative is the touch pad.  It is hard to navigate using it when browsing the net.  I tend to work in the dark, early morning hours and the scroll bar on the touchpad is almost impossible to find.  However, given all the other positives about this netbook, it doesn't warrant giving this less than a 5 stars.

This pet containment system is great! Bought it January 5th, set it up in an hour or so, read the directions about how to train your dog so it understands the barrier, and how you train him to it over a couple week period. Forget it, my dog understood the barrier after two days. He learned very quickly that once he hears the beeping collar, a couple seconds later comes the small shock, and he knows to turn back towards the house.
My dog was very high energy, and he always wanted to run and chase things, but this barrier has stopped that.  He knows how far he can venture from the house, and will not cross that barrier even if he's tempted by me, or anything else he's tempted by. Now I can let him out by himself anytime he wants to go out, without worry. In fact I trust it so much I've let him out with the collar on, and didn't even turn the barrier on.
After pricing in-ground barriers, you can't beat this unit for the price.

I've given this as a gift after my great experience with it.  These can actually be hard to find at times (local bed & bath stores told me they are a seasonal item for the fall (college dorms) and Christmastime).  I'm glad Amazon is stocking this one.

Air popped popcorn isn't as great as oil-popped, of course, but it is MUCH healthier and therefore worth it.  This pops it out in a breeze (kind of loud, but it only last a little while, and I don't think you can expect anything else).  There are few unpopped kernels (much fewer than with the Salton model I owned earlier).

All popcorn makers I have ever owned have gotten a few stray airborne unpopped kernels on the floor/counter.  I just live with that.

I've never cleaned mine in any way other than wiping out the unpopped kernels after use, so it's a breeze to own in that respect.

I received my Braun 5270 Silk-閜il X'elle Body System Epilator and I must say that it's paid for itself already.  I had been a regular waxer for over 3 years but the cost was really getting out of control.  So, I thought I would take things into my own hands.

I highly recommend this epilator over others.  It was very easy to use right out of the box.  Contrary to other reviews that claim the cord isn't long enough, the 6 feet of cord length is ample for me.  I used my Braun right out of the shower and was done within 10 minutes.  There was no tugging or pulling on my skin.  My hair length was a good 1/4".  I won't lie and tell you it didn't hurt a bit but it wasn't unbearable.  If you pull your skin taught, it's much more comfortable.

This was definitely money well spent!!!!

I have been using TurboTax since the ancent past when it was a DOS program from ChipSoft. Intuit seems to improve the product each year. They stay ahead of the ever changing IRS rules and regulations. TurboTax is a unique product. It sells hundreds of thousands of copies that require constant updating and the product will be obsolete in four months. The product relys on WEB connectivity to quickly respond to tax law changes. No product that deals with the IRS could ever earn five stars but TurboTax gets as close as it can in a very imperfect world.

I purchased this machine due to the software that allows you to offload the data to your computer for tracking and giving my doctor a record of my BP.  The machine seems to be very accurate...if you get the cuff tight enough when putting it on.  The cuff is different than other Omron BP machines I've owned in the past and takes some getting used to.  It is not as easy to put on by yourself as previous machines but with some practice it works fine.  If you have another user to help with putting on the cuff you will get the most accurate BP readings.

Overall, this pedometer isn't all that bad.  It's a bit larger than the ones I've had before.  So, when you clip the device onto your pants (the waist part), it feels a bit bulky and heavy making it sometimes hard to keep in place.  I've had a few times where it has almost fell into the toilet!  The good part is you can place this one in your pocket or purse and it keeps an accurate count (or at least I think so).  Another plus to this pedometer versus others is that the steps automatically clear (and go into memory) after 12am everyday.  That's a nice touch.

I know with all the other reviews for this mixer,  you won't need mine to decide weither or not to buy one for yourself, but, still, I was a little hesitant myself.

First, price aside, knowing now about this mixer, price is no longer an issue, it's worth whatever you pay for it. 

I finally got one, and justified it as, "Well, this is a Christmas present... to myself," but again, this mixer doesn't need justification, it's just absolutely amazing.

I used it for the first time, the other night, to mix my cheeses for lasagna.  This step usually included me with a large bowl, a large spoon, and my arthritis hurting after the first 10 minutes.  Especially when I have to do things like add salt, or basil, garlic or other seasonings, and have to make sure it's completely moxed again, before I can taist it, and continue this step over and over, usually taking about 20 minutes to make sure it's all mixed with the seasonings, and I'm pleased.

Anyway, I put all the cheses and standard seasonings into the mixing bowl, put the head down, and turned it on.  I have to admit, I was a little scared that the bowl wasn't big enough, but trust me, it is.  It's bigger than it seems in the pictures, and even at home, it's bigger than it looks, until you fill it up with stuff, then you realize how much it holds.  Well, back to the mixing, I put the head down, turned it on 3, and within the first 5 seconds, the cheeses were blended, the eeggs were already mixed in, along with the basil, garlic, salt and pepper on top.  This thing did just as much in five seconds, as it normally takes me 5 minutes in a bowl.

I won't bore everyone with more detail, but I will say, that I've been cooking for nearly 20 years now, so I know my way around a kitchen, and my only regret is not buying this mixer sooner.

I'm a perfectionist, especially when i comes to cooking, and this mixer allows me to be a perfectionist, quicker, faster, and actually, better.  

I just can't tell you enough, how much you need this in your kitchen.  If you think that your hand mixer does the same job, or is good enough, then don't bother buying this, because you won't appreciate things like the ability to have both hands free, or you won't notice things like if your cake is silky smooth, or notice things like, if the seasonings are incorporated into every bit of the recipe, instead of just on the food that your hand mixer will reach, and you probably think it's common for some bites to taist better than others, or some bites to be more overpowering than others, and you won't appreciate this.  However, if you truly want to be a better cook, and have your food turn out better, you will buy this.


Well, I hate to make this review even longer, but after using my mother's mixer that she got for Christmas, I figured I'd throw in one more advantage of this mixer... it's ease of use for those with arthritis.  I was noticing on hers, that you had to push down a button with strength, to release the attachments, while this you just push up, and turn.  Another great advantage is, with hers, you had to push in a button on the side, with force, and lift up, while it pinched your finger since it was placed where the hinge is, while this one, you just push back the lever, and lift up.  These small details that they include, truly do set this apart from any other.

This replaces a similar Braun product that I used regularly. I'd have given this all five stars but I miss the wall mount that made the Braun so handy. Rolling up the cord and sticking it in a drawer is no great chore, but after the convenience of pulling it off the wall with just enough cord to stay out of the way of other things on the countertop spoiled me. My regular use of a hand mixer like this makes me really want it ready to grab. I wouldn't mind buying a mount if it were available as an option. Now I'll have to rig something up.

One thing I do like over the Braun is that the mixing part of the device comes off and away from the motor portion for easy washing. 

I'd say "Buy it."

We have the slingbox up and running and it works well. There are three reasons why I did not give this 5 stars:

1) It is not emphasized enough when you are purchasing a slingbox, that you will almost definitely need to buy a slinglink with it. This is especially true if you have DSL for your internet. You would have to have your modem, your cable or satellite receiver, and your phone jack all in the same spot. If you don't have this, then you need a slinglink. So that is going to cost you more money to purchase that.

2) The picture on this thing is pretty good, but when you are watching sports games like I do (I have been watching Cavs games) the picture is not that great. It looks very blurry, but it is still watchable. 

3) The slingbox will not work when I have my safe internet filter installed (K9 Web Protection). I looked on K9's website and they had other customers complaining about the same thing. The web administrator for K9 advised us that there is something simple that slingmedia can do to avoid this from happening, but they just won't do it. If K9 would allow the setttings to work for Sling as they are currently set up, they would have all kinds of things go through unfiltered. So for this I blame slingmedia.

The set up for this unit was pretty easy. I am terrible at mechanical things and electronics and it was not difficult for me. I have it set up on both a laptop with Vista and a home computer with XP and it works fine. 

It is great to be able to change the channel on a remote that looks exactly like DirectTV. The only negative is, channel changing is a bit slow. But the good thing is, you can save all your favorite channels (the ones that I watch) and only scroll through those channels. That way I don't have to even look for something on TV unless I have the channel saved.

Overall this is a good product and I do recommend getting one if you need one.

This review is from: Iron Man [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)

      



Robert Downey, Jr. is terrific as Iron Man. His character, billionaire Tony Stark, builds weapons for the U.S. military. Stark doesn't even realize that it is his own WMD's that are being used for 'evil' until he (spoiler alert) is kidnapped early on by Afghan rebels. Downey is absolutely terrific as Stark. It is the actor's ability to balance humor with drama that actually carries the film all the way through to its' conclusion. The special effects are also dynamite, and the Iron Man suit creation is awesome. The plot has good twists, and there is enough great excitement (in the first hour especially) and light humorous touches that also keep me glued to the screen. Like all movies about good vs. evil, though, there are usually some problems as to how the director defines the 'bad guys'. The action begins in Afghanistan when Stark is kidnapped (no more spoilers, I promise). The men who kidnap Stark are supposedly rebels, and at first they are pretty frightening. But low and behold, when all is said and done, we discover that these 'Arab' rebels are nothing more than more stereotypical villains that we have seen in countless movies before, and they are not very smart, either. You even have the bald, steely-eyed Arab who has murder in his eyes (and lucky for us he speaks pretty good English). As for villains other than the predictable 'Arabic' bad guy, the writers have thrown somebody else into the pot, so that is a relief. Still, I wasn't content with the supporting cast. Terrance Howard, who plays Stark's best friend, does a good job with what he has, which isn't a lot. And the always gorgeous Gwyneth Paltrow, as Pepper Potts (Stark's assistant), is engaging to look at. Her light humor and sex-appeal adds a lot to what could've been a heavy-handed story involving all men and action. Unfortunately she seems to have little to do. Every great superhero film that I know of always takes advantage of the 'love interest' (Lois Lane, Mary Jane Watson, etc.). I hope she will have more to do in the sequel. The same goes for Howard. And Jeff Bridges, wearing a bald head and a beard, is excellent as always, and a perfect foil for Downey's Stark. But it is Downey who really holds the film together. And despite the stereotypes and an action-packed ending that gives me pause, or a sense of deja vu, as if I had seen that same ending in some other summer movie last year, and the lack of things to do for Howard and Paltrow (is there some kind of romantic entanglement between Pepper and Tony Stark?), 'Iron Man' really is a great popcorn film. Downey gives us pretty much a 'one-man show', and he is nearly perfect.

Like many other readers, I have been counting down until the release of Breaking Dawn.  I have always been impressed by Stephenie Meyer's ability to reach me with her books.  Even in New Moon, where I hated seeing Edward gone, it was well written and had me crying.
I think that Breaking Dawn is a fitting end to this saga.  I was pleased by the outcomes and impressed with the way that Meyer handled sexuality.  I wouldn't encourage the elementary school kids I teach to read this yet, but it was an awesome book.  Don't knock it till you've tried it, and happy reading!

As a fan of Baz's "Strictly Ballroom", I was disappointed to read the reviews of this film as I was set to see it due to the cast and subject.  I just rented it "On Demand" and really enjoyed it!  Jackman is really eye candy and most enjoyable and Kidman was ok.  I do agree that the chemistry was a bit lacking between them but I find that with anyone paired with Kidman as she isn't one of my favorite actresses.  I loved the little boy and seeing Jack Thompson again was such a treat.  I never was bored with the film and felt it moved right along and yes, the bad guys were a bit over the top but it was OK.  I feel it is worth an almost 3 hour look and certainly makes me NOT want to see north Australia.  A good film and fun.

Quickbooks for the money is always a good buy !! But, in reality here...There isn't much different or new for the 2009 version, verse the 2007 version. I myself upgrade every two years. Is is a must buy?? Not if you already have the 2007 version. If I had to do it it all over again, I might of waited for the 2010 version to upgrade. Just my opinion though.

David Allen is considered to be one the top five Management consultants in North America according to a Forbes article. I now understand why.The basic concepts in his book are simple enough and are represented by a flow chart, but there are so many other golden nuggets of &quot;best practice&quot; information within this book that you have to study it to get them all.  I've read the book and listened to his second (audio) book &quot;Ready for anything&quot; four times in a row just to reinforce the great points within this book.The result of implimenting his structure of workflow has suprisingly allowed me to act with more freedom and creativity in my job and a reduction in stress. I can even find stuff easily since setting up my folders and buying a label making machine (his recommendation).He's really on to something big with his &quot;next action&quot; thinking approach (chapter 11) and his two-minute rule.One of the best books I've read in the last three years.

I downloaded 1.06 GB in 2 min 27.63 seconds (yes I used a stopwatch so I could post this review to help all of you reading this). There were multiple big files but also a lot of small files. There were a total of 107 files in that download. I was downloading from a network attached drive, which may have slowed it down a little, but I don't really know. 

I tell you these things because I found it very difficult to get "real" numbers when I was trying to decide which hard drive to buy. I cared mostly about write speed because for the most part I will only use it to back up my files. I took a chance with this drive based on opinions from people I talked to, and I am glad I did. It is very portable and very nice looking. I opened a file to test the read speed, and it seemed fine. I don't know how to time the read speed of a drive, sorry.

I did not test the software because I don't plan to use it. I've heard that the software makes it faster, but I can't use it because I am on a public computer.

If you are looking for a hard drive case, I highly recommend this one! Caselogic PHDC-1 Small EVA External Hard Drive Case (Red) I hope this helps you make your decision. Have a great day!

I love Gossip Girl because it's different than all the other teen tv shows. It's about Manhattan's elite and the wild children of socialites, and real estate mogul's, etc. Some of it's farfetched and unrealistic, but even if you don't like the show the fashion is amazing. It deals with some real teenage issues- coke snorting, and date rape, at the extreme. It's not for young viewers, or even young adult viewers really. It's definitely an adult show. However, since these kids are in highschool it seems a little silly they are always sitting around bars drinking, but hey...teen shows are supposed to be a little cheesy, right? It's definitely not the Peach Pit.

This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) [HD DVD] (HD DVD)

      



     I don't usually respond to reviews but I couldn't resist this one.  I was intrigued by another reviewer's discontent on, not only the movie, but also the director Michael Bay.  To the reviewer's credit, I would agree that this movie and just about all of Michael Bay movies are very formulaic eye candy with nothing more than high budgeted special effects and fairly thin plots to carry the audience to 2 hours and beyond.  But what I don't get is how someone, who obviously knew all this, can discredit a movie as well as its director after plopping down money to go see it.
     When my girlfriend and I spent our $20 we knew exactly what we were getting.  So did millions of others.  You know why?  Common sense told us that Michael Bay wasn't trying to make his run for the Oscars with a movie like Transformers.  We knew that there was a high probability that he was coming with the same formula he used in Armageddon, Bad Boys 1 & 2 and Pearl Harbor...and we were okay with that.
     All we wanted was a night of descent entertainment and what we got was a movie that was a blast in every sense of the word.  The well-crafted CGI was phenomenal and will definitely raise the bar for other upcoming movies.  And although the movie didn't carry every conceivable detail of the cartoon series, its premise was close enough to hold a moderately avid fan's attention.  But as I mentioned before, this is Michael Bay's specialty.  And he's getting better with every movie he makes.
     I bought the HD version yesterday, watched it and had just as much fun as I did at the movies.  Not to discredit more Oscar worthy titles, but this type of movie is why I invested a lot of money in a top-notch home theater.  If you can get pass all the biased rhetoric towards Mr. Bay and his movies, then I would definitely recommend this one for a night (and future nights) of great entertainment.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)

      



The Sanyo Xacti VPC-E2 Digital Camcorder and 8 MP Digital Camera is sort of a multi-tool approach to still and video cameras. It does a huge number of things that other more expensive cameras do, and does them fairly well.  The thick instruction manual reflects the versatility and complexity of the Xacti.  There are several good reviews of this camera on Amazon, so I will not repeat the technical details already contained in these reviews.

The Xacti takes one hour of 640x480 movies per gigabyte of SD card. There is no HD mode.  Since 8 GB cards are readily available, you can get 8 hours of movies on one card. The small battery will not last that long, and may not last even 1 hour. A second non-oem battery may be obtained for less than $20. However, for most things one hour of movies is enough unless you are a pro and plan to do considerable editing.  In addition to movies,the Xacti takes 8 MP still images of good quality, and you can take a still while taking movies.  Both movies and stills have access to a 5x optical zoom that seems to be fairly accurate over its entire range.  Focus is good and quick. Movies are good at fairly low light levels, and stills can use the built-in flash where needed. As with most cameras, brighter lighting produces better pictures.  The ISO values increase to compensate for dim light, but the noise level becomes noticeable at ISO levels above 400 for still pictures. Noise levels in movies is not noticeable. I have now used the camera in movie mode in a child's birthday party in very dim indoor light. The results were quite good.

The camera has a very good macro capability that permits good focus down to about 0.5 inches. This feature can be a lot of fun or can be simply useful for recording extreme detail. I have now used this feature to copy old 35 mm color slides by placing them on an inexpesnive light box and photographing them. The Xacti does a good job. 

The fact that the camera is waterproof to a rated 5 feet means that you can safely use this at the beach or poolside where there is a lot of splashing.  Underwater photography seems to be an interesting application, but I have not tried that (it's winter now).

Picture and movie playback are easy using either the included USB cable (non-standard) or by moving the SD card directly to your PC using a card reader (my preferred method). The quality is surprisingly good from such a small camera. Zoomed images were sharply focused. There is some small delay in focusing when tracking objects, but this is not a problem in most situations. The large rotating view screen is a pleasure to use for taking pictures and for playing them back. When taking movies, the sound quality during playback is quite good.

The included case is almost useless. Throw it away and get another small carry case (less than $10).

Overall, I think the user will be pleased with the camera in a wide variety of situations.

I initially decided not to buy this item and discovered after finally buying it, when my son was almost a month old, that it could have really given me some extra sleep.  My son couldn't sleep without having his arms and legs pinned down, and swaddling in receiving blankets was a constant battle to get and keep them tight enough.  Once I finally bought the "swaddle me" it solved the problem.  The only drawback to it is that he grew too long for it around seven weeks and could then easily kick the bottom off negating the benefit.

Good: boot time is VERY fast, touch typeable, light weight, open office, nice pre-installed mail client, not hot to the touch, CHEAP!

Bad: recessed keys forces your thumbs to adjust to hit the space bar, the linux OS is not easily customizable (but easy to use if you don't want change anything), pre-installed media player is bad (but replaceable), pre-installed instant messenger is bad (but replaceable if you don't mind losing the mail client), screen is a bit small and must be viewed at about 20 degrees from below normal for good colors and contrast, bad speakers (or speaker driver). 

Compatability/Notes: RF mouse works by plug and play, Bluetooth dongle and mouse were a pain, works fine with Airport Express (even can print), if the desktop is very customized and the computer experiences a hard crash then its a lot of work to fix everything, friendly forum help http://aspireoneuser.com/forum/

I bought this a month ago as my first USB hub, and overall I am very happy with it.  The device is small and attractive and gets the job done.  However I do have a couple qualms about the design.  First, the provided USB cord connects straight on into the back of the unit, but the power adapter connects at a 90* angle, so they don't lie parallel to each other.  Second, the device does not indicate if it is running on USB power or wall power.  And finally, the indicator lights below each port are always on, so they have no function.  I would have expected them to come on green when something is plugged in, flash with activity, and maybe turn red when there is a malfunction.  Overall though, its small and works, which are my primary concerns.

As of this writing, THE PRINCESS BRIDE has received over 650 reviews from fans (and a few foes) across the Amazon world. This sort of response generally means that the film has touched so many people in so many ways. It is one of those rare films that is cross-generational and cross-cultural. Why? For all those obvious reasons: it is exciting, romantic, very funny, and, above all else, completely not full of itself. As a writer, it's one of those works that I wish I had written. Where else but in a world of fantasy can a child feel comfortable with pirates, giants, swordsmen, (Yiddish) wizards, brute squads, evil princes and counts, albino henchmen, and a sea full of eels? In some one else's hands, this could have been a mess. But through careful casting and Rob Reiner's impeccable direction, THE PRINCESS BRIDE is a like a visual toy chest full of joys.

One of our cats really loves to chase the jingly balls. Unfortunately, she would lose most of them under various bits of furniture within a day. This toy lets both of them bat around a ball all day if they so wish. The scratcher is also a great furniture saver. They used to sharpen their claws on the post and on the wicker. Now they just use the post and the cardboard scratcher. Your cats may vary. The cardboard scratch pad seems to last a decent amount of time. Each side seems to last a little over a month with two cats.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)

      



I have been using Microsoft's Live OneCare System for about a year-and-a-half, and I went to the 2.0 version about three months ago.  I've got to tell you though, I wasn't too happy about using it at first because of two factors:  1) Microsoft seemed to be linking a lot of things to this "Live" concept, and 2) The program seemed like it was making a lot of promises it couldn't keep.  On the first matter, I still have some concerns; on the second matter, it has lived-up to its promises.

After almost a year, Microsoft upgraded my product to 2.0, and then when I added another computer to my LAN, I used one of the three licenses that came with the new version of OneCare to extend my HUB's subscription.  And it did so without a problem.  You will notice on the picture I uploaded from my individual computer (see customer images), that my subscription will renew in three days.  

I don't know about you, but at work I've seen what not keeping-up with your virus protection and firewall protection can do to someone's computer.  Mine hasn't been hit, but other's have and we use Norton's and McAfee at work with each computer set for automatic updates.  At home, since I have a LAN, too, I wanted to make sure I didn't have similar problems, so for the past three years I tested several products, namely Norton's System Works, Norton's 360, e-Trust (Computer Associates), and OneCare.  

Having used Norton's for over 12 years, I have been disappointed that they are doing less with their products, and I really became disenchanted when they didn't offer their firewall protection with System Works.  Then, it seemed I couldn't find System Works, and I had to use 360, which was a mere shadow of System Works.  It grated me that I had to buy one product, then buy their Internet Security, too.  I, also, didn't think they were on top of the virus situation as much as they used to be.  Then, there was an issue about renewals that did not go into effect when they should, and hour long waits for tech support to help correct the problem.  

So, I tried e-Trust, and I didn't have any qualms about it, at first.  At first it sent out e-mails, often times several times a day to update the software virus protection.  Then, it went to an automatic check whenever you booted-up.  Then, came the renewal.  I had it on two machines and was successful only on one when it came to renewing my subscription.  Now, batting 500 is great in the major leagues, but not when it comes to protecting my computer.

OneCare, though, has lived-up to their promises.  At first I had it on one computer, and it performed a massive back-up that took all night (200 GB's... this was with version 1.0).  Subsequent back-ups went quicker for only the new, or changed, files were updated.  Adding 2.0 to other computers produced a back-up on individual computers much faster, 1 to 2  hours, depending on the computer, with amounts in the 100 GB range.  With 2.0, I've been able to have one centralized back-up on an exterior HP Drive.  I, also, have back-ups performed on each computer with various other drives: Seagate's FreeAgent, and Simple-Tech.  

In total, I have four computers set-up on OneCare.  Two are on the hard-wire, and two are on a WiFi connected to the hard-wire, with my laptop's back-up on another computers external drive (I added the laptop the day after writing this review, which gives me the 4th computer on the network.)  One benefit I've seen of using OneCare is that the new computer's version usually recognizes the printers on the network, and it asks me if I want this computer to have access to it.  If it doesn't, and I am not a networking whiz, I have just loaded the drivers for a printer that is on the network, and it then easily finds that printer and finishes out connecting the printer with that computer.  

Once I set my schedule of the tasks for OneCare, I've let it do it's job, and I've had only one issue, and that's not a OneCare problem... On the iMac, I have both Mac OS X and XP Pro running.  With XP Pro, I have OneCare   installed.  When XP Pro updates itself, it cannot download and install all updates, so OneCare gives me a "yellow," or caution warning.  After manually having XP Pro on the iMac finish its download, everything goes "green," which to me is a great place to stop this review.

OneCare has greatly simplified my life.  Version 2.0 is better than 1.0., and you can have from one to three computers covered with one subscription.  Also, when I extended my subscription, it added the year onto my current subscription several months in advance without my having to call tech support to straighten out a problem.  Regarding subscriptions, you have to have a "live.com" ID activating your initial, up to, 3 subscriptions  (for me this was a "hotmail.com" address).  If you have more computers to cover than 3, you will need a second "live.com" ID.  Renewals are around $49.00 for one year's protection for up to three computers.  Unlike some virus programs, like Norton's, you cannot uninstall OneCare and then install a newly-purchased, unused copy of OneCare, unless you install it under a different "live.com" ID.  (BTW, I learned this the hard way, yet the Microsoft folks were quick at straightening it out (866-ONECARE).)

As the say on TV sometimes, I"m a happy camper, and I'd recommend this product to anyone wanting to protect one computer or several on a LAN.  Be sure to check-out the pictures I uploaded to give you a better idea of what type of information you will receive from OneCare because that generally will tell you more than what I did about its capabilities.

This was a great purchase.  I have tried several other cheaper pedometers in the past.  They were very inaccurate and did not last very long.  I have had this product for over a month and my husband was so impressed that he ordered his own.  It works great in a pocket, you don't have to worry with clips etc.  I have also just carried it in my purse-- I do not think it is as accurate that way, but it still gives me a great idea of how much I have walked if I do not have a pocket to put it in.  I highly encourage you to purchase this product if you are thinking about it.

I may buy this some day.  I am sure the picture quality will be much better than the VHS copies I made from the SCI-FI Channel.  It took me 18 months to do it. Two episodes are banned from being telecast:  "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge", and "The Encounter".  I had to buy the DVD for these.  It took 44 VHS tapes to hold the rest.  Having to fast forward the commercials may drive me to buy the complete DVD set sooner than I expect.

After cataloging all 156 episodes from info off the SCI-Fi Channel website, and The Twilight Zone website, I narrowed down my top 10 favorites.  Oddly enough the top three happened to be written not by Rod Serling, but Richard Matheson.  When it comes to interpreting the essence of the fifth dimension that Rod Serling created, Richard Matheson does it better than any other writer.

What a joy it is to work with a five quart heavy duty mixer that makes short work of even the toughest jobs. This is the one that we were looking for to make dough, mix meats, and every other kitchen task we needed to do. It's powerful, easy to use, and simple to clean. It has made the holidays something special by helping to create all manners of holiday goodies.

It does take some counter space to keep it set up and it is very heavy, but that was to be expected. That is a small price to pay for a machine that keeps working for years after lesser mixers have long ago given up the ghost in a cloud of acrid burning smoke. Our first KitchenAid mixer was purchased 20 years ago and this replacement is exactly the same as the old one. I gave the old one to a friend who teaches home ec. She uses it regularly with middle school kids and it just keeps working - day after day.

The HP Mini 1035NR netbook has the same basic features as just about every other netbook that exists on the market today.  The 1.6 GHz Atom and 1024 x 600 display are all standard.  There isn't much to distinguish one netbook from another, but HP really did a fine job in some of the most important areas.

Before I purchased the 1035NR I had an opportunity to check out the offerings from Asus, Acer, Lenovo, MSI, Samsung and Sylvania.  I was down to a choice between the HP 1035 and a Lenovo S10 (which is $50 less and comes with an express card slot).

HP has everyone beat in the most important area -- the keyboard.  There is simply no other netbook on the market that has a real keyboard with good tactile feedback.  As a touch typist, I can't stress the importance of this enough.  Most of the other netbooks fail because they have placed the up arrow key between the "/" and the right shift key, which often results in the insertion point moving up one line when you hit the right shift key.  Those that are an exception, such as the MSI or the Samsung do not have the same tactile feeling.  The Lenovo keyboard is decent, but that up arrow key took it out of contention.

With the 1035NR you get somewhat less then you do with most every other netbook in the same or even lower price range.  The HP comes with a small 60 GB hard drive spinning at 4200 rpm.  Most others have a 160 GB at 5400 rpm.  Some netbooks have more then 2 USB ports but that should be enough for almost anyone.

But this netbook is the best currently on the market.  The slim design is extremely compact, with several nice touches, like the Caps Lock LED.  The construction is solid, feels good when you carry it and is very light.

The glass screen is excellent, very bright and clear, similar to the unibody MacBook, though it is glossy and not so great outdoors.    

The trackpad is very responsive, with a good amount of surface area.  The placement of the buttons on the side, rather then below, is awkward.  I had originally dismissed the HP and Acer models because of this.  However, the keyboard more then makes up for the button placement and it also shaves about an inch of the netbook width.  I can fit the HP in a large coat pocket, which I can't do with most of the others.  The trackpad configuration software can be configured for tap and hold, which is somewhat similar to pressing the mouse and dragging.  It would have been better if the HP had Mac like button-less trackpad with two finger click for right click.

The speakers are pretty impressive for such a small computer.  Streaming a Netflix movie didn't suffer from rendering problems, was crisp and easy to share with another person watching.

The built in webcam works very well when it has enough light and the microphone is adequate.  There is a single "hybrid" headphone/microphone port.

A VGA port is also included that uses a special connector, however the cable needs to be purchased separately.  The SD slot is spring loaded and flush to the body.

I was a bit surprised that there was no printed manual included, or at least a basic printed reference of the various ports, buttons, lights, etc and that one must go to the "Help" section to get this info.

The included battery is a 3-cell unit, which is OK and seems to last about 2 to 2.5 hours depending on what you are doing.  HP does have bigger batteries coming, but they are not yet available for purchase.

In a nod to Apple's packaging designers, the HP box bears some similarities to Apple's packaging.

While I ended up paying a bit of a premium for a machine with a smaller and slower hard drive then the competition, it was worth it for the keyboard, screen, compact and slim design and excellent build quality.

This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) (DVD)

      



Transformers, one of the year's biggest blockbusters , arrives on DVD on Tuesday and here at Mania.com we have you covered with a look at the two-disc special edition. Now working under the assumption that most visitors to the site have already seen the film I'll spend an equal amount of time on the movie itself and the DVD extras.

The basic plot finds both Autobots and Decepticons on Earth, searching for the Allspark, the cube that can essentially bring mechanical objects to life and a source of great power. The Allspark had found its way to Earth and Megatron sought to claim it but crashed his ship in the arctic and was frozen in ice. He was found by explorer Captain Witwicky in the late 1800's and the captains glasses were imprinted with the location of the Allspark. Several Decepticons (Starscream, Barricade, Frenzy, Blackout, Devastator, Bonecrusher, and Scorponok) have come in search of the cube. Blackout attacks a U.S. Military base in Qatar to hack into the military's computer system. Captain Witwicky's descendent Sam has just bought his first car, a rusted out '76 Camaro that turns out to be the Autobot Bumblebee. He summons the Autobots (Optimus Prime, Jazz, Ironhide, and Ratchet) to help protect Sam and find the Allspark before the Decepticons due. Now as I hate playing spoiler, even if you have seen it, that's the plot in a nutshell.

The two performances that standout for me are Shia LaBeouf as Sam and John Tuturro as Govt. agent Simmons. LaBeouf brings a perfect blend of innocence, vulnerability, and humor to his role. He's one of those average kids who is not a member of the "in crowd" but who finds himself at the center of the battle between the Decepticons and Autobots. He's natural and believable. Turturro is just a treat to watch chewing up scenery as the arrogant agent Simmons. He helps add a good does of humor to the film as well. Megan Fox's role as Mikaela Barnes was the one that left me flat. She seemed to be there only as eye candy (which she does very well). It's even mentioned in one of the documentaries that they were looking for the hottest 18 year-old they could find and apparently, talent was a distant second on the list.

A lot of fans were outraged when they saw their first look at the pictures before the film was released. They were upset that the Transformers didn't look like the Transformers they knew from the TV show or the toys. I was not one of those, however. Characters from comic books or animated shows NEVER look the same in feature films. It's a given we have to accept. What looks good in a comic simply doesn't translate well to live action. It's why the X-Men didn't wear their usual costumes in the films. That colorful spandex may look good on paper but in film it looks...garish. The CGI was incredible. I liked the quick, smooth transformations of the robots and their fluidity of movement. 

The robots, especially the Decepticons don't get much in the way of character development. We don't even see Megatron until a good two-thirds of the way through the film and Starscream gets only a couple of lines. I can't fault Director Michael Bay too much, however. Between all the human characters and a dozen or so Transformers, that's a lot of characters to try and develop. The one big problem with the look of the robots was that outside of Optimus and Bumblebee, most of the rest had indiscernible color schemes and it became hard to tell them apart when they were battling each other. And what happened to Starscream? I watched it a few times and still can't figure it out. One moment he's fighting Air Force jets and the then poof gone!

The extras on the two-disc set run a little over two hours total, not including the commentary track with Michael Bay. "Their War" (65 minutes) is an in-dept look at the Transformers themselves with comments from Bay, Steven Spielberg, and cast and crew. You'll see how the Transformers were brought to life. Bay even jokes about the angry comments he got from Transformers fans early on but admits he took the comments to heart and made several changes the fans suggested. Bay explains why Peter Cullen, the longtime voice of Optimus Prime was kept but Frank Welker, the voice of Megatron was not (It does make sense when you see how Bay explains it) He instead used Matrix and Lord of the Rings star Hugo Weaving for the top baddie. You'll get to see how many of the film's stunts and special effects were done, including how they cut the moving bus in half during the freeway battle...and there was NO CGI used! This was an outstanding documentary. I actually watched it before the film and it alleviated many of the apprehensions I had.

"Our World" (48 minutes) takes a look at all of the actors in the film and how they were cast. Josh Duhamel and the rest of the actors playing military roles went through several days of basic training in the desert to prepare for their parts including the firing of weapons and flying jets. Bay got full cooperation with the U.S. military including use of airbases and weapons, not to mention several soldiers in extras roles. They were very CAREFUL to mention that the producers compensated the military for their time and equipment...lest some liberal legislator starts screaming about wasting tax dollars.

"More than meets the Eye" is a short feature (about 10 minutes) on the making of the Desert Battle scene against Scorponok. You'll see this scene develop from storyboard, to computer animatics, to the final film version. One bit of trivia from this feature is that the soldier who is impaled by Scorponok's tail is played by Zack Ward. Ward is best known for his role as bully Scut Farkas in the holiday classic "A Christmas Story".

The extras are very good but a little light considering what a blockbuster this film was. I would expect that in six months time or so we'll be seeing a special Director's Cut with even more bonus material.

I bought this ice cream maker for my dad for Father's Day and then decided to buy one for my husband too.  We have made two different kinds of ice cream since getting it --Cookies and Cream and Strawberry Cheesecake.   Both ice creams turned out great!  When you first make the ice cream, it is a little like soft serve.  The kids enjoyed it this way.  But after keeping the ice cream in the freezer for a few hours, we were able to dip it for ice cream cones.  My only recommendation is that you buy the extra freezer cylinder with it.  The recipe that I had for the Strawberry Cheesecake ice cream made 3 quarts, so we had to wait until the cylinder froze again before making the second batch.

We were a little nervous about the concerns we saw posted before we bought this product, but went ahead and gave it a try. We couldn't be happier.  Our cats have become more enthusiastic drinkers, especially our female cat - who was not fond of drinking water.  She used to have problems "straining" in her litter box, but the extra water she drinks has solved the problem.  We have also been able to cut back on the higher calorie wet-food she was eating (to try to get more moisture in her diet) now that she drinks more.

We thought the filters and the cleaning kit might be a rip-off.  I don't know how much the filters actually "purify" the water, but they certainly help prevent hair and food clogs, and allowed us to go longer between cleanings.  Likewise, we found cleaning to be quite easy with the kit.  The brushes are just the right size and it only took 5-10 minutes.  I can certainly handle that every week or two.

The noise hasn't been a problem either.  We have hardwood floors, so we put the unit on a towel.  If we remove the towel, it makes a slight hum as the motor vibrates against the floor. With the towel, all we hear is the sound of the water running.  (You have to expect that, right).  We got the extra reservoir, so we can go a couple of days without refilling.

With minimal effort on our part, out cats now have something that makes them happier and healthier.

I've had this netbook for about 2 weeks. It's amazing! I've used it everyday, it works perfect for mobile computing. I like the fact that the display is 10" and it comes with the 160 gig hard drive. Complaints are few; I often bump the touch pad while typing, but it can be turned off while using a mouse(the Microsoft Bluetooth laptop mouse works great), the power button is situated oddly, so sometimes your not sure if it really turned on or not. The glossy finish is a finger print magnet. Having a netbook requires getting use to, I suppose the smaller ones may be worse. All things considered it's a good trade off for the portability, storage and the display you get with this netbook. I would buy this laptop again without hesitation.

I started Watchmen having no idea what it was about and I think that is probably the best way to read it: no preconceived notions on what you think it should be.  Just sit back and read it and go along for a spectacular ride with extremely in depth character analysis.  I'd recomend Watchmen to  anyone and everyone.

I do like this little machine.  It works very well.  The swivel finger screw is very convenient so you aren't moving and maneuvering your hands all around your head.  It's sleek looking.  The attachments make it very appealing, although I've only used the tongue scraper and pick attachment so far.  There s a top to the reservoir that holds the extra tips while maintaining the integrity of the reservoir.  Having a choice of so many speeds is very nice.  I thought I wouldn't really use this feature too often, but I find that under certain circumstances I am fine tuning each use! You can add mouthwash, etc. which is a nice feature.    The price was right.   

The cons would be that it's noisy.  I'm not sure one can truly find a "quiet" water pick.  The water reservoir is on the smallish side.  I wish it came in different colors.  

All in all I don't think you'd be disappointed with this choice.  

UPDATE:  Have had this for 1/2 year or so.  The Pause button sticks making use of this machine frustrating.

At the time I put this on my wishlist there were maybe 400 some odd reviews. I am not a sadist. Nor am I a regular wax user. I had tried the 80's coil torture device. After reading the reviews I decided to try this again. The massaging beginners head made this a much more painful experience then it had to be. Halfway through the first time using it-I put on the advanced head and found it to be less painful and quicker. On the second use I could not even feel it. Remember hair grows at different rates. The only reason this did not get a 5 from me. Is that my legs are really sensitive so I got razor bumps which take about a day to go away. THAT I can live with since I did not have to epil for 3 weeks.

Director, Gus Van Sant, screenwriter, Dustin Lance Black and a marvelous cast comprised of Sean Penn, Josh Brolin, James Franco, Emile Hirsch and Diego Luna create for us an unmistakably honest and affecting movie about Harvey Milk.

Milk, who in 1972 was determined to turn his new home in San Francisco into a gay-friendly refuge, fought incredible odds to be elected to public office, and became the first openly gay man voted into public office in California.

Penn clearly captured the essence of Harvey Milk, attitude, mannerisms, emotional makeup and all else.

The script chronicles Milk's journey with a building suspense, and Van Sant stayed away from many melodramatic traps, thus creating a moving and energetic life story of this man.

I PURCHASED THIS  Cuisinart 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker ABOUT 8 YEARS AGO FROM CHEFS INC AND AFTER ALMOST CONTINUAL USAGE( I OWN A SMALL CATERING/EVENTS BUSINESS) AND OVER 8 YEARS IT FINALLY BROKE. SINCE THEN I HAVE TRIED OTHER CHEAPER BRANDS AND THEY ONLY LAST A FEW MONTHS. I LIKE THE GOLD PLATED CONE FILTER, THE WATER FILTER(THAT'S INCLUDED) AND THE 3 STAGE TEMPERATURE SETTING THAT THIS CUISINART COFFEEMAKER OFFERS. I RECENTLY FOUND THIS ONE ON AMAZON AT A GOOD PRICE AND DECIDED TO BUY ANOTHER ONE ...SOMETIMES QUALITY PRODUCTS DO NOT CHANGE OVER TIME, FOR I HOPE TO GET GREAT TASTING COFFEE FOR ANOTHER 8 YEARS WITH THIS  Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker. TAKE MY ADVICE AND SPEND A LITTLE MORE ON THIS PRODUCT AND YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.
***BTW... THE WATER FILTER GIVES COFFEE A BETTER TASTE!

I got PG (with Triplets!) during my first cycle using the CPFM. The monitor was clearly able to pinpoint my exact "peak" time of the month, and it was SO easy to  use. My favorite thing about the monitor is that it takes the "guesswork" out of knowing if you're going to ovulate or not, and no need to worry or stress over not being able to read traditional ovulation tests. This monitor is definitely worth the $ and I recommend it to anyone who is TTC!

We are RVer and for many years used DirecTV.  With my packages it cost us about $95 a month.  With the Sling Box I just hooked it up to the DircTV DVR at home then to my broadband modem and that was it.  We camp where there is WIFI and the service is free.  I still can't believe how well it works.
I need to buy the bridge too since my DircTV DVR and my broadband modem are in different rooms.  Still works like a champ.

Apple does it again with this Nano.  I've had a four gig Nano for about three years that i work out with and have enjoyed using it.  This one is even more amazing. So many features it's hard to begin.  The video and application downloads are fast and very clear.  I've downloaded almost everything on my computer and music library and have barely begun to fill up the storage space!!  So glad i gave it to myself for Christmas!! These units are very durable and dependable.  A great product for the money AND Apple is really good about service and tech support.

I used to own a Zip 100 Parallel. It was useful alright but it was heavy. The drive itself was kinda big and the power adapter was heavy.I was delighted to see the release of the Zip 250 USB Powered drive. Not only is it slim and lightweight it can store a lot of files. Since it's USB it's faster than the Parallel port drive so you could copy large files quickly. Since I travel to other countries, I don't have to bring a power adapter to make it work.Installation is a snap. Install the drivers, plug the unit into your USB port and it's ready to store your files. If you have Windows ME you don't even need to install drivers, just plug the drive in and it automatically starts it.Buy this drive, you won't be disappointed. They usually sell for $189.

This is not a replacement for a high-quality HD camcorder with a nice lens, zoom, and all the fine features.  I have one of those, but I don't take it out often, and when I do I turn into a videographer/camera-man.  So, bought a Zi6.  It is a great product for its size and portability.  It's only a little larger than a PDA.  I can stick it in my pocket and get hd-quality video anytime. Once you come to terms with its limitations (it's weak in low-light conditions, and its zoom is quite basic), it becomes a great companion.  I picked Zi6 over Flip because of its ability to use either rechargeable or AA batteries and because of its expandability via SDHC card.  It's great for unobtrusively capturing family videos and all kinds of life's moments.  In short, pick this video camera for the same reason you'd pick a small point-and-shoot over an SLR.

This device is a clever reworking of the frozen-container, handcranked ice cream makers developed in Japan. The central core is a sealed canister containing refrigerant that can be frozen down to 0 degrees Fahrenheit in your freezer. The old style maker used a paddle and hand crank to pull the shell-frozen cream from the sides of the container, mix in the requisite amount of air and produce a soft form of homemade ice cream. These makers were very popular, but the method left something to be desired. Cuisinart took this freezer container, added a well-designed, angled paddle that stands by itself inside the frozen canister and set the entire unit onto a motor topped with a clear cover. The canister is turned by the motor, the paddle remains in one place via a stop placed on the plastic lid. You pour your ice cream mixture in through the opening in the top and let it spin for about a half and hour. Presto, ice cream. This appliance is well-designed. The open top, meant for pouring in the mixture, also allows you to check the consistency (and, yes, snitch a spoonful for quality control purposes, of course.) The even, continuous turning is a big improvement over the handcranked model, which had you turn only sporadically. The design of the paddle pulls the frozen shell properly from the sides of the canister. I have to say, the Cuisinart works JUST GREAT!! There are a few things to observe for better results: 1. You should probably chill the ice cream mixture prior to freezing it in the machine. The directions and recipes included with the maker do not specifically tell you to do this, but even a cold mixture of refrigerated yogurt and peaches needed, in my opinion, to be pre-chilled.2. You probably will want the extra freezer container, because the unit needs to freeze for at least 6, and best for 24 hours before you can make a batch. The extra unit allows you to make an additional batch immediately, or a second flavor. If you entertain, this is important. 3. The recipes tell you that it is "optional" to ripen the ice cream, that is, to freeze it before serving, for two hours. This really is a must, especially for yogurt and lower fat based recipes. A few mashes with a fork during the ripening can avoid crystal formation.4. Frost-free freezers are not ideal for ice cream storage. The heat cycle that removes the frost does a real number on ice cream. If you don't plan on serving it right away, (hahah not a problem at our house) a deep freeze is best for storage. Here is my own recipe that I used for my test of the ice cream maker:Middletown Peach Festival Frozen Yogurt Ingredients:2 cups low-fat plain yogurt (I use Stoneyfield, but any brand will work.)5 very ripe, mid sized peaches (size of your fist) I got about 2 cups of frothy puree. 1/3 cup raw or organic sugar (can use superfine or granulated)?tsp Fiori di Sicilia flavoring (...You could probably substitute some vanilla and orange extracts, but the Fiori di Sicilia is best.)Method:Peel peaches by spearing them on a long fork and dipping them in a bath of boiling water for about 15-30 seconds. Run them under cool water and pull off the skins. Stone and quarter them.Puree peaches Blend in sugar. Allow to mix, then stand so sugar dissolves completely (about 15 minutes. This is a not-too-sweet recipe, so you may want more. You can use extra fine sugar instead of the raw sugar. Or granulated.)Add 2 cups of yogurt and blend well. Stir in the Fiori di Sicilia flavoring.Chill mixture for 30 minutes (optional but recommended.)Set up ice cream maker with pre-frozen canister--the canister should have been frozen according to directions for at least 6 and best if 24 hours previously. Turn on, pour in mix. Allow machine to turn and freeze for 30 minutes. Transfer frozen yogurt, which will be slushy, to a container (do NOT store the frozen yogurt in the Cuisinart freezer container!!!) and ripen for 2 hours before serving. A few stirs during the ripening improve the texture.

This is a great little modem that takes me all around the interweb zip zip. Just don't order it from Amazon. Their seller, NYC Electronics, shipped it out minus the all important power cord.  When this happens as I discovered, no power on earth can get either Amazon or NYC Electronics to send a missing power cord.        

Eventually, it was not Amazon or NYC Electronics who made it right but  Motorola who very kindly sent a power cord gratis. Bless Motorola. Boo Amazon and NYC Electronics. 

It was a month before I was able to finally power up the modem and put it to use.

I got the X52 to replace a broken X45, it was not defective it was broken by accident.  When I bought this the X45 was hard to find.  I really liked my X45 but with used prices (...)plus shipping and new units  (...)plus shipping the X52 for only a few dollars more made sense.  I like the X52 and think it is slightly better than the X45.  I like the layout of buttons and the adjustable flight stick handle.  The X45 flight stick handle was always a little too small even with the plastic pinky button removed.  That said, I wouldn't upgrade to the X52 if you have a functional X45 because it isn't that much of an upgrade.  The X52, for the price/features, is the best HOTAS you can find.  The lcd screen is, however, really just a gimmick.

This is not a time management system as much as a "stuff" management system.  "Stuff" is defined as anything that is where it isn't supposed to be and/or hasn't been accomplished but you haven't put a plan together to move it forward.

"GTD" presents a very good system to organize many of the practices you already follow into a coherent, usable system.  However, you will likely add a couple of twists to whatever you currently do to identify and accomplish all of your responsibilities:

- Writing everything down
- Addressing "next actions" immediately (!)
- Creating systems to track your "to do's"
- Creating reminders that pop up when you need them  

You may not implement everything in the book, but it is well worth the price and the few hours to read it.  I have been giving this book away to people ever since I finished it.  I just bought 50 to give to friends and clients.

So many reviews........  I bought this coffee maker 2 years ago and have not had any problems with it.  Makes excellent coffee, does not drip, no rusting anywhere, clock works perfect.  I am a coffee drinker that was tired of getting "tinny" after tasting coffee until I bought this Black and Decker.  Cleaning the carafe was a little difficult, water would not completely empty after rinsing, therefore I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I am buying one for my daughter for Christmas.

I was looking for a mini bluetooth dongle that can go with my Acer Aspire One netbook. As candidates, I had this mini dongle against one made by IoGear (over $30 including S/H)

Initially I was a little hesitant of buying this dongle because this dongle is basically 'brand-less' very cheap-looking product. However, for less than $10 (including $4.95 S/H), the price was low enough to convince me to have a go. 

The package contains a mini dongle with an installation CD that includes user manual and installation software. When I plugged this dongle to my Acer Aspire One, Windows XP finds a matching driver and enables it. YOU SHOULD AVOID THIS. Instead, install IVT BlueSoleil software in the installation CD. BlueSoleil software makes device pairing easier and also provides easy access to several Bluetooth-enabled services. I tried three Bluetooth peripherals so far: two BT wireless mice and one BT headset. All three devices worked very well.     

Although I am very pleased with this mini-dongle, the reason why I can not give five star rating is the lack of technical support. Initially my external DVD drive had some problem with reading the included CD-ROM. It could be a real headache if I couldn't get it done by using desktop PC & copying all contents of CD-ROM to a USB thumb drive. I couldn't find any web address or any brand/manufacturer name in the package to search for software/driver downloads.  
 
Overall, it is a big thumb-up for a $10 mini-bluetooth dongle.

This morning was the first time we had ever juiced and the outcome of the experience was much better than I anticipated.  I am so pleased with the choice I made in buying this juicer.  It being an entry level model and that its suppose to be easy to use and clean got my attention along with reviews from others.  Well, it certainly has been all that they claimed.  The motor isn't loud and the machine doesn't vibrate at all. 
The brush that came with it made it easier to clean the filter while holding it under running water.  But it still took a good 5 min to thoroughly clean.  So I think next time I'll lay it in a small bowl of water immediately after the machine shuts down and just drink our juice first.  
The pulp, from what little I know about this sort of thing, was fairly dry. 
This juicer seems to be of good quality, so it gives me hope that it will last for a long time to come.

my daughter is now 6 mo and we've been using the halo sacks since she was about 3 months old.  (prior to that, she needed to be swaddled, so we couldn't safely use the sacks.)  anyway, we LOVE them.  i have 3 fleece ones for cooler nights, and 1 cotton one for summer.  incredibly easy to use, so we're able to slip her inside then zip her up without waking her, which is great because in our town the temperature drops sharply later at night.  we were given a couple of these in size S and they lasted until she was about 25 inches long, at which point she got a bit restless, so then we bought a few in size L.  the shape is such that you probably don't need to buy the XS size - a S will do fine at first, and even an M might work.  HIGHLY recommended!  so comfy for baby!

First off, let me say that I have had this product for over a year, and it has performed flawlessly.  The manual indicates it is designed for indoor use only. With that in mind, and the fact that I don't allow cats into my home, I built a small shelter over the electrical outlet and the fountain, so there is no danger of electrical shock when it rains. Three cats use this fountain, but one cat seems to be addicted to it more than the other two. I bought it because of him, since he would always try to drink from the garden hose whenever he could. With the fountain in place, he does not seek out the garden hose anymore.

The product is very well made, and I like the fact that if anything ever breaks I can buy the individual parts (there are 5 plastic parts plus the pump) separately.  That is a big plus.  Initially, I thought the pump would not last very long, but it has been continually running over a year without any problem at all. If it ever breaks, I will order a new pump (about $15.00) without hesitation.

The fountain needs to be taken apart and cleaned every three weeks or so.  This also involves disassembling the small pump.  The first time I tried it, I was disappointed in the amount of time involved. It probably takes 30-45 minutes to do a thorough job, but it is like any other household chore; it needs to be done, and the cats deserve fresh drinking water.  Also, the reservoir is a little inconvenient for cleaning, so you may need a good bottle brush for that purpose.

The reservoir tank holds enough water for a 4-5 day supply.  Be sure not to let the water level get too low, or the pump will burn out if it is not totally covered by water.  

As I go on vacation occasionally, I have jerryrigged an additional 128 ounce supply of water from a plastic bottle and plastic tubing that gravity feeds into the main tank.  This additional reservoir gives the cats at least a 7-10 day supply of water, perfect for me, and the cats have never run out of water.

Drinkwell also sells charcoal filters that fit inside the fountain.  Since I already use filtered water, I have not replaced the filters as often as I should. 

One other note,  I add a small amount of vinegar to the water.  My cats still drink it, and the water stays cleaner longer than if I just use the unfiltered water without the vinegar.

Can I say more?  Well, this neat little ice cream maker doesn't take up much space on the counter when in use &amp; stores easily -- the base is no wider in diameter than a dinner plate.  The metal container portion of the ice cream maker has hollow walls that are filled with a fluid. After having it in the freezer overnight, when it's thoroughly frozen, you put it on the base, fill it with the ingredients for whatever flavor of ice cream you desire, put the mixing blade in and the top on then flip the switch. About a half hour to an hour later you have fresh delicious ice cream!  It's that simple. You can cover the original container and slip it in the freezer for later, or you can dish it out and wash and refreeze the container -- it is very easy to clean. Also, by the way, it's the best ice cream you'll ever have. Buy this as I did and you won't be sorry.

The Flip is a cool device.  It's small size (a fat deck of cards) makes shooting snap-videos as easy as taking digital stills.  Perfect for a vacation, for getting stealth video clips, and for anyone who wants to make quick, easy, home made films.  The built-in USB connector is a great feature, allowing you to drag .avi files to your desktop.  The simple design is also welcome...not too many features to tempt you.  After all, this is about quick snap-videos,  not perfect film.  I would recommend the 60 minute version.  You'd be surprised how fast 30 minutes goes.  And for the price, it's worth it.  Speaking of price, these things are an amazing value.  Only downside: although the hard plastic construction feels sturdy, the Flips are not the most resilient devices in the world.  I've bought a bunch for a work project and two have broken.  But what can you expect for a$100 device.

Purchased this NAS about 3 weeks ago and it works exactly as advertised with two terabyte drives.  Bit torrent software in the current build is particularly useful. Unit is whisper quite, but has big blue lights that I wish you could dim. Biggest issue may not be Dlink's fault, but Windows Vista's.  My primary computer is a Vista laptop which does not want to log  on to the mapped drives from sleep or remember passwords. My XP machines work like a dream in this respect. Units other limitation, so I've heard, it won't turn on automatically after a power outage. In all it was just what I needed.

I juice vegetables daily which requires a juicer that has power & durability. The Breville Juice Fountain Elite has all of this and more. My most recent juicer before this Breville burnt out in less than 3 months. So far the Breville has proven that it will stand the test of time. The most surprising thing to me was that the juice from the Breville tasted much better to me than the juice I was getting from my other juicer. The juice is much more consistent and flavorful. It reminds me of the juice I get at the local a juice vendor which uses a $2000 juicer. I would recommend the Breville juice fountain elite to everyone.

I'm very happy with my MacBook.  It has a refined look and feel, both the hardware and the software, and its performance and capabilities are excellent.  

Size and weight are perfect.  The glossiness of the screen is a total non-issue in actual use, though the range of viewing angles and color depth leave a little to be desired.  Great track pad.  

From power-on to web browsing: 45 seconds.  From standby to web browsing: almost instantaneous. 

I won't extol the virtues of OS X here, but they are numerous. 

Battery life is pretty good though somewhat less than advertised in real-world use. 

Sound quality from the built-in speakers is amazing for a small computer with invisible speakers.  

Highly recommended.  You can get similar specs and features for less, but you won't get that fine-computing experience you get with the MacBook.  Now I need to get my son one so I can use mine.

I purchased this shaver at the recommendation of a review in Consumer Reports. It arrived in just a couple of days from Amazon.com in perfect condition. I followed the instructions to prepare it for use, and immediately took it on a week's trip.

The shave is remarkably close. While I don't think any electric can match a safety razor for closeness, this one gives my Mach 3 a run for the money. I shaved using my old Norelco rotary shaver after I had used the Remington for about 2 weeks, and I was amazed that the Remington beat the Norelco hands down. Nice and smooth, little 5 o'clock shadow.

In other reviews, there had been comments about how noisy this shaver was. I beg to differ. It does buzz, but it is quieter than my old Norelco and not at all objectionable.

The trimmer is fairly wide (the same width as the foil head) and is a bit awkward to use. It does work well, and has two height settings: the highest for straight trimming, and a lower setting to work in conjunction with the foil/blade section to get longer hairs while doing your regular shaving. I did find the trimmer to be hard to use when trimming my mustache, since it's wider and harder to control.

After the initial charging period (24 hours), the battery lasts over 2 weeks on a charge, and takes only about an hour to fully recharge.

Cleanup is easy--I usually just blow out the stubble daily, then use the brush once a week to get some stubborn whiskers out of the blades. You don't use the brush on the foil--just blow or rinse.

In fact, I believe that most people that have problems with the foil failing could be from two reasons: pressing too hard while shaving, or using the brush to clean the foil. Hey guys, it's a thin membrane! You don't need to press hard with this shaver. I get a great, close shave with just a light, even touch.

The shaver comes with a compact carrying case that includes a flap to separate the brush and cord from the shaver.

The bottom line: This is a great shaver at a really great price. If you're looking for a shaver that will fill the bill and not cost you an arm and a leg, I'd recommend this one.

After a lot of comparison shopping and using various products over the last ten years, I finally decided to purchase the Norelco T980.  I am delighted with my purchase and it exceeded my expectations in every way.

This unit is light, easy to operate, rechargeable and has precision blades that cut evenly.  The extra attachment for fine detail works well and I don't get cut using it.  The vacuum attachment works well even when it's not on Turbo and I personally think it's very quiet.  It's unrealistic to think a mechanical device in this price range won't make any noise at all.  If that's your expectation, you might want to use scissors.  However, this product gets the job done much quicker and the sound is not annoying and unlikely to wake up someone else on the normal setting.

The flexible blade housing pivots smoothly and covered the contours of my face very well with an even cut at several different lengths.  While it's difficult to get close to the nose because of the larger size of this unit, I don't see that as a big deal because with the smaller precision tool you can do this quite easily with a mustache comb if you are not much for completely manual operations.  This little bit of extra work probably took me under 30 seconds.

Overall, the design of this unit is well thought out and it is quite attractive.  The holding space for clippings is pretty big and unless you have a thick beard, you probably won't have to change it until after several uses.  The battery also lasts about 30 minutes on Turbo and you can use the plug-in adapter after that if it runs out.

I don't see any drawbacks at all with this product.  I'm completely delighted with my purchase and the value that I received for my investment.

This review is from: The Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc Special Edition) (DVD)

      



Indeed a repackaging of past "remixes" of special features, this two-disc special edition is quite the treat for those who -like me- grew up watching "The Wizard of Oz" time and again. If you don't own your copy, it is a way to enjoy the movie as well as learn about the details and complications that led to its making. If you already have one of the many 1, 2 or 3-disc versions around, you may honestly not find much new in here.

In any case, being able to enjoy it any day again makes this set a unique treat. Having seeing it dozens of times as a kid in Spanish, I cannot help but think that, as we get closer to its 70th anniversary, "The Wizard of Oz" still retains a universal and timeless quality and freshness that makes it more than a classic: it's a story that transcends space and time and is bound to entertain all generations to come.

These blades were difficult to find at local drug stores and department stores.  Local stores carried similar items but not for the model I required.

Let me start by saying that this is an incredible piece of work, I have never read any comic thats similar. The storyline is orginal, follows the politics throughout the ages of the Watchmen, and the end is what you never expect. The artwork is pretty good as well considering the book was released in 1985. If you liked V for Vendetta (the comic book or film) you will definetly enjoy this piece by author Alan Moore. Finally if you want to just bone up on what Watchmen is before the film comes out in March, you will know everything about the film so don't pick up this book unless you wanna know all the spoilers.

This review is from: Quantum of Solace (DVD)

      



I thought this movie was quite good. If I have any complaints, it's that I'm not a fan of over-edited action scenes (including those in Bourne and Batman Begins), and that the "theme" song that opened the film was pretty awful. 

I'm not surprised by the number of reviews that complain about the villain's motivations, which most reviewers boil down to "he wants to increase the price of water in Bolivia." Um...no. But viewers can't really be blamed for this assessment. The movie doesn't make it easy to piece together what's happening and why. I didn't really understand the full implications of the plot until after leaving the theater and thinking about what I'd seen. 

I realize Bond films aren't meant to be overly cerebral, but this one does demand that viewers pay attention throughout (not really something we're used to when it comes to Bond films). The fast pace doesn't make it any easier. I agree that the action scenes harken back to Bourne (which actually harken back to Peter Hunt's editing of On Her Majesty's Secret Service), but the plot is definitely Bond-ian, with global implications, giant super-secret organizations, etc. Definitely not Bourne material. But like I said, you have to pay attention to what the various characters say and do in order to get it. 

I had an opportunity to speak with a professional movie-reviewer after seeing the film and it was clear that a lot of details were getting past people. In this instance, the reviewer noted that he loved the scene at the bar where Felix Leiter asks Bond what he's drinking and Bond turns to the waiter to ask the same, as if he doesn't even know. My reviewer friend pointed to this as a sign of Bond's total disinterest in sensual pleasures. A sign that he's become such a hollow shell, a straightforward killing machine, that "shaken" or "stirred" doesn't even factor into his thinking anymore. And yet, the ingredients that the bartender lists in his reply to Bond's question are the same as those that Bond used when creating the martini in Casino Royale - the martini that he later named a "Vesper." In this particular scene, he's had six of those particualar drinks. It's clear he knows exactly what he's drinking and that he's obsessed with finding out why Vesper was dragged into the larger plot. 

The other thing to keep in mind when watching Quantum of Solace is this: Casino Royale was a very small incident related to the plot of QOS. Similarly, QOS is a small part of something making up a much larger conspiracy. My fear is that we're not likely to get the ending of this three part tale due to so many complaints about QOS. 

SPOILER ALERT - Don't read any further if you haven't seen QOS yet 

As to the plot being nothing more than Greene's desire to charge poor Bolivians more money for water, many seem to be missing the point. Greene doesn't care about the water. What he wants is a way to control a puppet government. He arranges for the Bolivian general to be put in charge in exchange for ownership of a parcel of land. He gets the land and we discover that it enables him to control the water supply. He then tells the general that the general will do what Greene wants or the Bolivian people won't be getting the water they need. Greene doesn't just control the water - Quantum now controls an entire third-world country. Greene also notes that similar plots are unfolding around the globe. Quantum is toppling governments and gaining control over them. We are seeing one small part of a larger puzzle. One might think that control of a third-world country wouldn't be much of a threat until you really think about what's going on in the world today. Where do the real threats come from? What countries now make it a common practice to harbor terrorists? To support the drug trade? To kidnap Western tourists? The list goes on and on. For one criminal organization to have control over four, eight, a dozen, two-dozen or more third-world countries is downright terrifying. 

So what we're getting in QOS is a glipse of this larger plot. A single example of what's happening around the globe. I was rather hoping that a third film in the series would lay bare Quantum's ultimate plan and reveal them to be a Spectre-class villain for a 21st-century Bond. I don't think it's going to happen though. Even though QOS made a ton of money, I expect the negative response from so many will scare the producers into taking the series in a less challenging, more conventional direction. 

Another interesting thing is how the villain dies. I find it wonderfully ironic that he dies from not having any of the very thing he just obtained massive amounts of a few minutes earlier. 

END SPOILERS 

In any case, I found the film to be quite interesting. It really peaked my interest in seeing the third part of the story, by the end of which our much-loved Bond would have been completely forged into the super spy we all know and love. 

I definitely recommend the movie for a second viewing to catch the details that may have been missed the first time around. It's a different take on Bond, but one that I think works quite well - as good, if not better, than most of the other Bond films.

This review is from: Let The Right One In (DVD)

      



"Let the Right One In" is among the most striking vampire films I've seen. It is less a horror film than a drama with a horrific premise that jumps out at the audience every once in while. The film was directed by Tomas Alfredson from a screenplay written by John Ajvide Lindqvist, author of the novel on which it is based. In a working class suburb of Stockholm in the early 1980s, a frail, bookish 12-year-old named Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is terrorized by bullies at his school, while a murderer who drains his victims' blood stalks the community. Oskar is miserable, without friends or any obvious self-esteem. One evening, he is approached by Eli (Lina Leandersson), a 12-year-old girl who recently moved into his building. Eli is as socially isolated as Oskar is, but she could be a dangerous friend to have.

The violence that lies beneath the nearly silent, snow-covered exterior is the scary part. It's cold. The population seems affable but disaffected. The efforts of Eli's keeper (Per Ragnar) to procure blood for her are so mundane and matter-of-fact that their violence is all the more startling. Yet I almost pitied him his difficulties. Oskar's mounting anger threatens to explode. Eli is a haunting girl with dark hair and big, blue eyes, possessed of a calm resignation and no aversion to killing. The film achieves its creepiness through a measured pace, quiet setting, and a refusal to spell anything out for us. We're never certain what's going to happen or even what we want to happen. We come to understand Eli's predicament slowly. In the end, I wasn't sure what I thought of her, but Eli made a strong impression. In Swedish with optional subtitles.

The DVD (Magnolia 2009): Bonus features include 4 deleted scenes, a Photo Gallery of 20 production stills, a Theatrical Poster Gallery of 5 posters, and a "Behind the Scenes" (7 1/2 min) featurette in which director Tomas Alfredson talks about the movie, casting, and characters.

This epilator is definitely a keeper.  I'm a girl and I have facial hair, especially in the chin area. I used depilatory creams or waxes before I decided to try an epilator.  Other epilators gave me razor bumps and had trouble removing some of my facial hair.  This one works like a charm and doesn't irritate my skin.  I will continue to use my razor for my underarm area but I definitely give this product two thumbs up for facial hair removal.

I don't think this or the mat dvd is over-rated at all! It is definitely a hard work out, it is a little difficult to follow but once you do it a few times, its very manageable. Its the same with learning anything new, &#34;some people&#34; just don't have the patience and when they don't learn something right away they give up! Once you get the basics of the dances, and do it frequently you do begin to see great results! But you do have to work at it! As long as you are consistent, you will feel the burn in all the necessary places. All in all, I am going to give this DVD 5 stars because, it works out every part of your body, and if you keep with it you are going to be very pleased with the effort you put into it. And I DO NOT have any dance background, just a dedication to keep myself happy and healthy! Hope this helps.

I've used a number of different slicers.  I used to just slice meats but this slices breads, tomato, onions, peppers, celery -- you want it sliced?  It slices.   

It comes apart easily, goes back together easily and the only way to improve it would be to have it be self cleaning. (yes, I'm kidding)

I can't say enough about this machine!  I researched LOTS of bread machines before purchasing this about a year ago and am so very satisfied.  My children cannot have sugar or refined flour so I make whole wheat sugar free loaves and anyone who bakes bread knows how dense and tough it can be to work with that kind of dough!  I make an average of 4 loaves a week and this machine handles it no problem and produces even loaves every time.  I have also made regular white bread and some other breads like raisin, etc and have always had fabulous results.  I also find it is very forgiving if you don't measure the ingredients exactly!  The recipe book it comes with has great basic recipes that are easy to build on or modify if needed.

Fans of the Twilight Series will love this final installment of the addictive saga.  Breaking Dawn differs from the first three books in that it is split into three sections, introducing Jacob as a narrator for the middle section and consequently creating a refreshing change of pace.  Bella familiarly narrates the opening section, and of course, provides the voice for the remainder of the saga.  

Although wonderfully well-written, many readers will find Breaking Dawn to be a bittersweet read.  While bringing the Twilight progression full-circle, it is also the inevitable end of a series that readers cannot help but immerse themselves in wholeheartedly.  The words "The End" printed on the last page are ridiculously disappointing, despite being preceded by a traditional "happily ever after" style finish.  So while this book is highly recommended, keep in mind that most will feel an overwhelming emptiness upon completion that can only be satisfied with more, more, and more of Bella & Edward's story.

An afterthought: Stephenie Meyer, if vampires live forever, surely you can create more stories about their lives!  You've got all eternity to choose from!  Please?!

Bought the medium sized Furminator to try to keep ahead of the mats that form on my furriest kitty. The instructions clearly say not to use this tool to get rid of mats once they are there - in fact, it says to take your kitty to the vet to remove mats first. That said, I did use the Furminator on a couple of areas that didn't have mats and it worked like a charm to remove lots and lots of the undercoat. 

The caution I would put forth is that using the tool isn't all that comfortable for the pet. When I noted that kitty seemed to be flinching, I ran the Furminator through my own hair to see how it felt. There is a certain amount of hair pulling even if you don't have an undercoat to remove, so I would not try to subject my pet to prolonged grooming sessions. Easy does it.  

Another caution I would offer after reading another person's review of this tool is this. The reviewer said she had used the Furminator on a kitten and was amazed at the amount of hair she got off a little kitten. I don't think you should use this tool on a kitten precisely because it is removing the undercoat which a kitten needs to keep warm. Same goes in the winter for any pet (cat or dog) that is an inside/outside pet. Sending a Furminated pet outside would be similar to sending your child outside with only a t-shirt on when they need a sweater or coat! 

Tool gets a 4 star because it is extremely well made and works as advertised. Only one star off because of the cautions.

This is a great little router.  I am using it on my home system to connect iphone, iMac and PC.  All installed up flawlessly.  The newest firmware update from Oct 2008 allows PC users to plug USB devices (printers or drives) directly into the router.   Mac users are out of luck at present.

I'm also using this device with my Verizon FIOS system.  I'm cheating a bit on the setup, but its been working great.  I connected the Verizon Wireless Actiontec Router to one of the DIR-655 ports.  The default IP addresses for the D-Link router are different from the Actiontec, so there has been (so far) no conflict between the two devices.  I then switched off the wireless settings on the Actiontec.  Works great and I am getting VERY fast connections using both the 802.11g and 802.11n settings.  I have NOT used this for gaming, so can't speak to those performance issues.

Unlike another review posted here, I find the router to be running cool.  Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this device.

I am not one to usually make comments, although I shop on Amazon several times a week. But this time is an exception. I saw this brush on the Hot Sellers list, read the reviews, and figured that if it didn't work as advertised, Amazon would take it back. To test this brush, I did my regular routine of brushing our two cats. And as usual, got tons of hair. I just knew that the FURminator would have very little effect on them. WOW, was I ever wrong. This thing is incredible. Not just good, incredible. It does't take the top coat hair, it goes down to the "fluff" hair, the hair that gets nappy and dirty. It pulls out this hair, distribution beneficial oils to the outer layer. Even after using my regular brushes, this thing doubled the amount of hair.

Throw away your other brushes. This thing is absolutely amazing. It may be expensive, and maybe even a bit over priced. But they have developed a product that is superior to anything on the market, as far as I am concerned.

And if you haven't signed up for Amazon Prime, you have no idea what kind of convenience you are missing out on.

I bought this toothbrush as an upgrade for an Elite Sonicare I happily owned for a year. And I must say, this product has everything I missed from the last one: it's perfect. My main concerns with the previous toothbrush was it worse than average Ni-Cd battery, it's non-universal charger, and the rigidity of its 2-minute timer.

The Flexcare improves in all these aspects:
- Great Li-Ion battery: can recharge the toothbrush anytime without worrying about breaking the battery.
- Universal travel charger: great to take anywhere. (especially for anyone like me living in a 220V country)
- Plenty of brushing programs: I specially love the GoCare for when I'm in real hurry. I used to do a "manual" go care counting on my mind with the previous brush.

The cheaper brush replacements and the UV sanitizer are welcome additions. With this product I really don't miss a thing, it's the perfect tooth cleaning solution next to a professional inside your mouth. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

I needed a joystick, nothing fancy just something simple.  I bought one that was a little too simple for about $16.  I needed ANOTHER one.  I found this Logitech Attack 3  one, for also $16.  The caliber of the LA3 in quality and use is amazing.  This joystick is fantastic.  The stick itself is spring loaded but feels like it's gliding.  The buttons and trigger are all on hair touches making for easy presses.  And the throttle is a gliding scroll button that's very smooth and never leaves where you put it.  One hand works the stick while the other works the bottom buttons and throttle.  If you need a joy stick for some simple flying and dog fighting, (i.e. Star Wars Galaxies: Jump to Lightspeed) then the Logitech Attack 3 is perfect for you.  Low price that delivers way more than it should.  If you're a "sim" kind of guy then no, don't get this because it's not a sim stick, it's a joy stick, and it will bring you joy.

I only had the wheel for about 2 weeks.  It was great.  Easy to use and easy to install.  Since I am a pc user the pedals were not suited for me.  I am used to the MOMO racing wheel.  The wheels in question is designed for individuals that sit on the floor or on a designed chair for using the pedals.  Sitting in a chair, I couldn;t get use to the pedals.  If they would redesign the wheels for the chair operator, then I would love to have.  It has always been a dream of mine to have such a great wheel.

This router is probably one of the best i've used. The only reason it would get less than 5 stars is if you didn't know the difference between a cable modem and a router (that's how easy setup is.) I bought this mainly for gaming (Xbox 360) and it has worked flawlessly even with WPA protection up (no lag i mean whatsoever!) Also if paired up with VTA-VR phone adpater you can have a VoiP phone connection. I highly reccomend this router to anybody for everything they could possibly need. (except for streaming HD movies which only $250+ routers could only think of doing)

Finally, the one true organizational system that focuses on outcome (productivity) instead of process. It actually clears your mind.  

Throughout the years, I have received formal and recurring employer sponsored training in both Daytimer and Franklin Covey organizational and time management system.  These were primarily paper based approaches. While clearly capable and expansive (if not expensive) systems (when properly trained), they engage you in processes that can be overwhelming.  Simply assembling the planner systems can be a chore that seems to never end (folders, sections, paper based contacts, project management tabs, task tabs, delegated tabs, A-Z filing system, calendar, goals tabs, priorities tabs, personal vs. business tabs, the list goes on). I often found myself more engaged in assembling and reassembling the system more than anything else.  By my conservative calculations, I must have spent at least $3,000 on various paper based systems over the last 5 years; not including software integration attempts (all failed).

The GTD system breaks through the aforementioned paradigms and views everything in your life as "stuff" without regard to whether it is personal or business.  Essentially you have one intake point for everything.  From there, you decide where to place your "stuff" until it is actionable.  I will not bother getting into all the details in this review as there are many websites dedicated to the GTD philosphy that can do a much better job.

Suffice it to say that the GTD system is analagous to an ever changing task list.  I use toodledo.com to manage my task list using the folder system in David's book.  Toodledo.com integrates with my Iphone so that I always have my task list with me everywhere I go.  It is important to note that appointments and meetings are treated as tasks and placed in the Agenda folder.  

The book is an easy read and there is an incredible amount of supplementary material on the web.  Just Google GTD.

Hello I am very please with this router so far. I upgraded from the wired Linksys router. 

And for only about $70 you can not get a better deal on a router.
This router is made by Cisco and for those of you who do not know this is the brand networking that all of the major companies use. So basically Cisco makes Linksys products for the standard home user but with the same quality as Cisco products.

This is SIMPLE to setup! All you have to do is connect everything then your computers should be sharing an internet connection. The hard part is to get the home networking, sharing, etc to work.

Here is how I did this (in XP):
1) First try using the Home Network Wizard which usually does not work for most users.
2) Go to your Network Connections and then right click on the Local Arean Connection and choose properties.
3) Make sure all of the boxes are checked and installed under "This connection uses the following items".
4) Highlight Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and then click on properties.
5) Now at the bottom click on the Advanced button.
6) Now at the top click on the top tab named "WINS".
7) Under Netbios setting make sure to choose "Enable NetBIOS over  TCP/IP.
8) Then click on OK and on OK again, etc.

Now you will be able to access files from other computers in your network and print from other printers, etc.

The area coverage on this router is excellent! All throughout my house I have full speed. I can access my network on my whole property which is over 5 acres large. If you need to go any faster or farther I recommend you try the Linksys Wireless G Router with Speedbooster or the new Linksys Wireless A router.

I hope my little directions helped you in setting your home network up. Once again I recommend you buy this over any other router. I have had Netgears, D-Links, Belkins, and many more and none have been near as good as this Linksys. The only thing that I have to complain about is I still have not been able to get the encryption to work.

I couldn't stand the hair all over my floor anymore.  I was told that I should shave my lab/shepherd mix, but then all I would have was short hair all over the floor.  I borrowed a friends shedender and although I didn't like how you held it, it worked well.  On the search for a wider tooth product, I discovered the Furminator.  I found the best price for it on Amazon and thought I would give it a try.  My daughter thought I was crazy on how excited I got when it arrived in the mail. I couldn't wait to try it out on our dog and was not disappointed.  It worked so much better than the shedender and was easy to handle.  Although my dog didn't care for his tail to be brushed, he actually seemed to enjoy it.  My husband said it looked like I had sheared a sheep by the time I was done.  I let a friend borrow it for her dog and cat and she is hooked and plans on buying one soon.  Thank you Furminator for helping me keep my floors cleaner and thank you Amazon for the great price and ease of ordering.

I reviewed this item once and carefully described how well it worked on my wife's annoying tabby (Bobo!).  For some reason, the review--and it was extremely helpful--was pulled.  I suspect, some sensitive vegetable eater complained.  Well, I described how the settings work on this fine product and how it tamed my wife's otherwise incorrigle cat (a cat, like all cats I might add, from Hades).  Ok then.  I try again:  This is a great product and it WILL WORK ON CATS.  Sincerely, HHD.

I bought this a year ago after wasting my money on several other coffee makers, and I have loved this unit since day one.  Easy to use, easy to clean, and above all, makes great coffee, lattes, mochas, tea, etc.  I use this with freshly ground coffee (Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks) using the reusable filter and it makes a great hot cup every single time.  If I could change a few things with this unit, they would be: 1) more aggressive styling; 2) more/larger cup sizes; and 3) better quality (perhaps stainless steel) reusable filter.

I've been using Seventh Generation diapers for two years straight (for a boy and a girl) and they are by far my favorite diaper. They are absorbent (never leaking, even overnight on my well-hydrated two year old) and the tabs never come unstuck. I love their simplicity (no silly characters!) and their durability. The sizes actually fit kids of the weights they claim on the package, unlike other natural diapers I've tried. Even after we moved abroad, I still pay to ship Seventh Generation diapers half way around the planet because they are just that good.

Setting up this router is very easy - it worked fine right out of the box. I especially like the feature which allows one to completely disable the wireless network if it is not needed. One thing that I *don't* like is that one cannot reserve a static address for a device that you want to stay at the same address all the time, such as a printer. My obsolete old Netgear "b" only wireless router would let me do that.

As nice as this router is I can't believe that they would overlook that feature. Otherwise I'm very happy with it.

I have been flying flight simulators since F15 Strike Eagle (If anyone can remember that one) right up to MS flight simulator 2004 using only the keyboard and mouse. 

I always wanted to learn to fly for real, so in July of 2004 I started taking flight lesions. I was able to realize my dream in January of 2005 when I passed my check ride and received my private pilot single engine land class rating.  Almost all of my flight simulator skills transferred to the real Cessna 172 and saved me money! If anyone tells you any different...well shame on them. If I had it to do over again, well I probably wouldn't change a thing. I was able to find a great price for this yoke and all of my personal flight goals were achieved. If you want to shorten the learning curve and remove some of the inherent flight simulator barriers. Then this is the yoke for you. I (and my four year old little girl) have been using this product for a couple of months now without any problems with mounting, setup or operation. Of course she is having a little trouble with her landings but that's a feel thing right.

My husband saw this toaster/egg cooker in a magazine and requested it for a Christmas present.  I never imagined it would work so good.  You can have a soft-cooked poached egg or a firmer one and the toast and egg finish cooking at the same time, and it doesn't take very long at all, plus it warms the Canadian bacon as well.  Plus you can hard boil four eggs in this little "super" machine" also.  I recommend it highly.

I was VERY skeptical to try this because I am a VERY picky eater.  I was surprised and pleased that it's great.  It tastes sort of like frozen orange juice concentrate.  I mean, I don't want to just go eat it for a snack, but I definitely don't dread having to take it.  It's also a smaller amount than I expected.  If you put it on a teaspoon, it only takes up about half the spoon.  Most of the fish oil supplements in this price range do not offer this much of the good stuff, so it's a real value.  I would HIGHLY recommend getting this.  Also, they have a deal where you get a free box with four proofs of purchase, so that makes it an even better value.

This review is from: The Princess Bride - Dread Pirate Edition (DVD)

      



By now, we've all seen the anti-piracy messages before movies in the theater and on DVD. Heck, I even saw an anti-piracy message before "Fantastic Four," which was rather optimistic of them when you stop to think about it.

(Of course, if you're watching a pirated copy of a film, odds are the pirate edited out the anti-piracy message...so you have to question the efficacy of the presentation.)

Many of these messages feature testimonials from film-crew-members bemoaning the fact that you're taking money out of their pockets, and film stars saying the same thing...even though the star of a film typically makes at least 2,000% more than the gaffer does.

But the true message is that you're hurting box-office ticket sales by bootlegging films, and therefore hurting the studios' bottom-lines. And Lord knows, we can't let the corporate stockholders take any sort of financial pounding. That might mean they have to pass on buying their teenage children each a Lexus.

As an aside, one MIGHT be inclined to argue that producing fare like "Date Movie" is much more damaging to a studio, whether I paid to see it or not (sadly, I did).

Obviously, the anti-piracy campaign is just for publicity; the studios' REAL response to piracy seems to be encouraging us to buy films on DVD more than once, in what has become known as "the double-dip." Even though tons of people gladly fell for it, "Lord of the Rings" is a perfect example of this. Go to Half-Price Books and see how many of copies of the first DVD releases are on the shelf because cloak-wearing dupes rushed out and bought the Extended Editions.

In some cases, we've even seen the dreaded "triple-dip." "Princess Bride" is coming out on DVD yet AGAIN, after an initial "bare-bones" version, followed by a second "Special Edition." Remember this, though: the hero in "Princess Bride" is a pirate.

From my complaints, one might be led to ask: "cousinpaco, are you DEFENDING piracy, thereby supporting theft of intellectual property?"

My answer would be: "do you seriously consider "the Pacifier" to be intellectual?"

No, I'm only kidding, Mr. Diesel. My REAL answer is "of course not." As any local exotic-dancing establishment can attest, I'm a loyal payer for my entertainment (when I'm not borrowing stuff from the library, that is). My DVD shelf is clogged with fair-and-legal copies of home video selections, from "8-1/2" to "the Transformers: Season One."

But when I PLUNK DOWN TWENTY-PLUS DOLLARS FOR A DVD, AND HAVE TO SIT THROUGH TEN MINUTES OF CRAP BEFORE I EVEN GET TO THE MOVIE, I seriously consider putting on an eyepatch and downloading illegal copies of the new "Big Momma's House" just out of spite. Enduring countless previews for junk that I don't want to see if the first place is bad enough (if you like "Spider-Man 2," you're sure to love "Hitch"!), but when an anti-piracy message pops up on a disc I just paid for, my rage explodes like the volcano on the cover of "Dianetics."

And don't get me started on endless animated menus that show scenes from the movie.

Having been hooked up via a Netgear hub for the past two years, I wondered if I could gain any networking improvements by installing a switch. I was concerned by some articles relating to their 'configuration' however. Well, as one reviewer has already said, &quot;it took longer to take it out of the box than to install it!&quot;. Hooked up the four workgroup PCs and VOILA........everything just came back up as though nothing had been altered, EXCEPT for the new SPEEEEEED!Don't hesitate on buying this little beauty!

Now I don't leave home without it.

Training to walk a 3-Day (60 mile) it has become my new body attachment. 7 day history, ease of use.  Set up instructions were easy. I love the clip & tether. 

The Omron product is amazing.  Now, I'm going to buy one with Stopwatch action.  NOTE: This particular model is NOT a heart rate monitor as "tagged".

Great.  5+ stars!

I got this for my son who is a junior in high school and I wanted him to be able to have not only an MP3 player, but a device can hold contacts for colleges and universities, baseball coaches, and football coaches for recruiting purposes.  The wifi allows him to check his messages frequently throughout the day and respond immediately when needed. He is able to put his schedule in Outlook and sync it to keep himself organized.  He already had a new phone so this was a great device without spending the extra money for an iphone.

We have had the Drinkwell Fountain for over 5 years.  We looked everywhere for the replacement filters and had a really hard time finding them.  Thank you Amazon for carrying these.  They really do a good job of keeping the water from getting slimy and cutting down on the frequency of cleaning the fountain.

I own a Creative Labs 30g mp3 player and love it - especially for the price. My teen daughter has wanted an ipod. It was a hard change for me but I broke down and got the 4th gen Nano 8g for her for Christmas. I must say that it does have some extremely cool features! The shuffle shake feature is fun, the slimline size is unbelievable and the sharp album cover flow is way cool. Doesn't sound any better than my Creative, but it's bells and whistles blow mine out of the water. My daugter loves it, she's happy and I'm saisfied! Amazon at the time beat everyone elses price by 10 to 15 dollars, plus free shipping!

I have a 1 year old Shih Tzu that had horrible matting and tear stains on white fur around his eyes.  Within 7 days of starting the Angel eyes it was all gone.  He is on just a small maintenance amount daily now and the stains have never come back.  I suggest mixing the powder into some wet canned food and serving a little each day after their dry kibble (unless they are on wet food full time).  He seems to think the couple of tablespoons of the wet food are his "treat" after he eats his dry kibble so it works out well.  Angel eyes is great!

I waited a while before writing my review, just to make sure my first opinion on the product was correct.  Let me say, this is a great product!  It works like it says, leaving you with smooth legs and arms.
I have fine hair on my legs, that is pretty light in color, so I don't shave normally more than once or twice a week.  My arms are even lighter, so it's mostly the smooth feeling that I am looking for, not ridding my body of sasquatch hair:)  All joking aside, I was absolutly terrified to touch my arms when I got this.  I really thought it'd hurt.  For me, it doesn't hurt on my arms at all, very very slightly on the back of my thighs, but it's not painful.  I will say that my underarms do hurt, and since I can't seem to get the skin taut enough, I have had my husband do it.  It doesn't do a great job on the underarms, but it could be my technique.  
I used the "beginner" head on it for a while, then just changed it to the advance because I felt comfortable doing it.  It does get more hairs this way.  Also, I use the high speed, not the slower one.  Again, it gets more hairs.  And, regardless of what others have said, I DO like the light, especially since my hair is fine and light.  If your hair is on the dark and coarse side, it may seem a worthless feature, I don't know.  I have not used the clipper feature yet, seeing as I do not need it.  It is easy to clean, which is always good in this type of product.  
Two things that I would change.  I would make it cordless, or give it a swivel cord.  And the "advance" head seems almost too loose and wants to come off.  Other than that, I highly recommend it.

What an amazing series!  Every episode was superb!  The plot was develped well BEFORE the series began.  Great character development for all the actors.  So sad it was off after only one season.  Star (Alex O'Loughlin) was perfect for the part.  CBS believes the draw was for the actor, but the stories themselves were wonderful.

This review is from: Watchmen (Hardcover)

      



** This review contains minor spoilers. **

In Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons's "Watchmen," there is a character called the Comedian who resembles the Joker from "The Dark Knight" in his gleeful contempt for humanity. And he was one of the good guys.

Somewhere in the multiverse, in a realm where superheroes exist, the Keene Act of 1977 outlawed "masked vigilantes," with the exception of those who worked for the United States government. Edward Blake, a.k.a. The Comedian, continued under federal contract, committing atrocities in the Vietnam War, until one day in 1985 he was thrown out his New York City apartment window. One of his few remaining admirers, a jaded rogue known only as Rorschach (once described by Moore as a study in a real-world Batman - the end result is, unfortunately, "a nutcase") becomes convinced that someone is targeting costumed adventurers and sets out to warn his ex-comrades. Things get even shadier after the Comedian's funeral (attended by such notables as the Dan Drieberg, once the Nite Owl II; Doctor Manhattan; Laurie Juspeczyk the second Silk Spectre; and Adrian Veidt, previously called Ozymandias) when godlike superhuman Doctor Manhattan is publicly accused of giving a several of his former associates cancer and subsequently exiles himself to Mars. Once hailed as America's ultimate weapon ("The superman exists and he's American!"), his departure emboldens the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan and plunge the nuclear powers into political instability.

As World War III lurks on the horizon, an ominous conspiracy becomes increasingly apparent, as Veidt is attacked in his office building, Rorschach is framed for murder, and rumors arise of a mysterious island where scientists and avant-garde artists labor together on . . . something. "Watchmen" is best described as a multilayered superhero mystery written as postmodernist metafiction - that is, "writing about writing," or making the artificiality of the art apparent to the reader. As one retired hero (Hollis Mason, the original Nite Owl) recalls in his memoir: "For me, it all started in 1938, the year when they invented the super-hero. I was too old for comic books when the first issue of ACTION COMICS came out, or at least too old to read them in public . . . There was a lot of stuff in that first issue. There were detective yarns and stories about magicians whose names I can't remember, but from the moment I set eyes on it I had eyes only for the Superman story." Pastiche is also evident in the snippets of magazine interviews, newspaper articles, and book excerpts that precede each chapter and frame the costumed adventurers of this alternate 1980s in their greater social context. Mason's nostalgic recollections of Superman's cheery can-do moral absolutism later become a moment of sadness, almost, as the contrast to the chaos of the present is increasingly apparent. A dark supernatural pirate story called "The Black Freighter" that recurs throughout "Watchmen" as a comic in a comic reflects the current mood far more accurately. Its crazed protagonist kills his wife in her bed in a deluded attempt to save her from murderous buccaneers, not unlike the "Watchmen" villain, who "saves" the world by slaughtering half of New York City.

Not surprisingly, "Watchmen" is, above all, an attempt to deconstruct the superhero myth. But overall, it is humanity that drives "Watchmen": humanity at its best and at its worst. I read Boccaccio's "The Decameron" and found myself amused at how little our nature has changed since the fourteenth century (our capacity for crude humor certainly seems thoroughly undiminished). But today (and in the 1980s) there is a new paradox: that of technology, which has given us superhuman powers to both move the earth and to destroy it. "All our knowledge brings us nearer to our ignorance," as T.S. Eliot once said. Exemplifying this is Doctor Manhattan, accidental post-human entity created, as many superheroes such as Spiderman have been, by chance exposure to something out of a laboratory. Now add that the emerging postmodernist worldview - which is inherently nebulous, unstable, and even nihilistic - and what is the result? That, I believe, is what "Watchmen" really explores.

In short: "Watchmen" a visually striking, superbly-written graphic novel, but definitely not breezy reading. Moore and Gibbons may have built their story on a genre that has historically centered on good triumphing over evil, but their updated vision has none of Superman's rose-tinted valiance. Because the real world is rarely so pretty.

It's great. It's a great size, it's portable, it's attractive, and it has more capacity than I could ever really need. That's all I knew about it when I bought it, which was perhaps a bit rash; normally I do a little more homework beforehand. So, upon plugging it in, I was surprised by the fact that it came bundled with all sorts of useless and irritating software.
Ultimately, I recommend it. Because it IS a great size, portable, and attractive. But the I also recommend immediately reformatting it if you're the type that just wants the basic drag-and-drop function.

I'm going to be moving soon. One device, Tivo Series 1 DVR, is far enough away from my network router to need either a really long Ethernet cable, or a wireless connection. Got the Linksys after reading some reviews. Was a bit wary because the software is Windows only and I have an iMac. But everything worked out for the best.

After pulling the Router out and connecting it, I hooked a Linksys WET11 Bridge onto the Tivo. Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm. The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g. However since this Router is backward compatible, that doesn't pose a problem at all.

Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity.

Trans Formers is a fun action packed movie for adults and teens.  There is a great deal of violent scenes that may not be appropriate for younger audiences.  In one scene, the mother asks her son if his room was locked because he was masturbating.  This scene may bring up ideas or discussion prematurely.

This brush is AMAZING!!!  I tried several different spays/gels, because my boyfriend is allergic to cats.  Hands down, this works!!!  Removes a ton of fur!!!  (And - even though I'm not allergic - I enjoy it because it causes the cat to shed a lot less.)  After using this brush - combined with a HEPA air filter - my boyfriend's allergic reactions at my place were significantly reduced.  That picture tothe right of this screen (of the black cat with the mound of fur in front of it) is NOT an exaggeration... this brush really does eliminate that much fur.

Only downside is that the cat hates this brush (but she doesn't like any brush).

My 8 week old doesn't sleep as good if she's not swaddled and this is an easy swaddler. The velcro is pretty strong. I was using another swaddler by a different manufacturer but she grew out of it. I like that this one is nice and big with room to grow.  If you are having problems getting your infant to sleep I recommend you read "The Happiest Baby on the Block". Swaddling is one of the ways the author recommends you do to get your little one to calm down. It works for us!

Installation was easy, but had to call Linksys help line to get it connected to the dsl, which was frustrating. Stayed on the phone for good 4 hours and tried everything written on their script manual.  Finally, I tried different things since I learned the basics from the call and got connected. Don't know how or why, but since then the product works fine without any problems. Now, I have to work on setting up the Firewall and security...not looking forward to calling overseas again.

This is and always will be I'm sure my favorite movie of all time! I have so many childhood memories with this film and everytime I watch it, it gives me a sense of my childhood once again! I have seen this movie I know more than 100 times and it still is not enough! More magical than ever with the DVD version, this DVD is a MUST-HAVE! Even if you do not purchase DVDS regularly this still should be in your collection. To Wizard of Oz lovers everywhere this DVD gives you so much more than any VHS ever has! FANTASTIC DVD extras! The deleted scenes are great considering back when the film was made what was not used was usually thrown out.The interviews, the Angela Lansbury special, theatrical trailers (very entertaining), and everything else on the DVD make it a true must have for any Oz fan!The film is still as precious as ever and the DVD features are a must!If you are an Oz fan and you do not own this, you should!Journey through an unforgettable world with Dorothy, the Scarecrow, Tin-Man, Cowardly Lion, and Toto too!

It's hard to imagine spending this much on an iron, but I have used flat irons from Target and you will pay more for this but it heats up to a higher level and more evenly than other less expensive ones.  If you have very curly hair, this may be the only one that will work for you.  Without humidity, your hair will stay straight until you wash it. If you live in a humid area, there isn't an iron out there that will hold your style.  To protect your hair from the high heat, you need to use a pomade or a flat iron spray.  You really do get what you pay for!!

i have this gate installed in my kitchen doorway. my twins lean their combined 50+lbs of weight against this gate, shaking the bars and yelling to get my attention, and it holds firm.  the latch is complex enough to befuddle 2yos, but simple enough for any adult to handle.  the gate is tall enough so they don't even attempt to climb over the gate and very VERY easy to install.  best of all, it comes with the extensions that every doorway seems to require.  LOVE IT!!!

My daughter was really tuff to stop sucking her middle fingers.  I tried begging, bribing, and multiple other over-the-counter items.  I even tried a product sold only by the pharmacy that had cayenne pepper.  That was a real treat....  The first time I put it on, she hated it..  "Cool" I thought until she brought me the bottle an hour later and wanted more put on her fingers "please."

HEHEHE...  

When I bought this, I was reluctant because of the price (which is really not that bad, but if it did not work, I would have been mad).  Well, in 48 hours, she was done sucking her fingers.  I have not put the product on her fingers since, and she is so proud of herself.  It worked PERFECTLY!!!  Even after all of the failed attempts.  It was quick, perfect, and magnificently effective. 

Would highly recommend, even if you feel like you have exhausted all avenues (like I felt I did).

I got my HG20 camcorder on Thanksgiving sale with free battery pack (BP 827). I'm really impressed with the performance so far. Video and audio quality is top notch, both outdoor and indoor (with normal lighting). I connected it with my Samsung 4061 HDTV, the video quality is simply exceptional. The focus is crystal, and zoom is great. The hard drive is really quiet, unlike my previous Panasonic camcorder SDR-H18. I haven't tried SDHC recording yet. The photos taken with this camcorder are really good too. The menus are user friendy, you don't need to dig thru' the manual a lot. The battery life is average, but I wouldn't worry much since I got BP-827 for free. 

The only downside is that you have to charge your battery with the camcorder since no seperate battery charger is included in the package. 

The supplied software is for basic editing. It's similar to the one supplied with Panasonic SDR-H18, but this s/w takes AVCHD format only. I have used the Panasonic software for basic editing (cut unwanted scenes, add transition between scenes, add title, music etc), so it's not that bad and the menu's are almost the same. But my Turion 64 laptop is too old/slow to edit the AVCHD format, so I'm collecting the videos for future editing with faster computer.

You can read the professional reviews on cnet.com and camcorderinfo.com which gives you indepth analysis.

I compared Sony HDR-SR11 before buying, but HG20 beat SR11 with price, quality and performance and is worth every penny.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)

      



Straight out of the box, we were impressed--the box was very heavy duty (very similar to an ipod box if you've seen those). The camera itself was extremely tiny and lightweight--definitely something to throw in a pocket or a purse.

Hubby grabbed the camera while I got out the instructions--but they were almost unnecessary. Simply press the power button and hit record and you are off and running! Yes, the camera comes with a charge! (We guess between a half and 3/4 charge!) 

We did a few test movies of our dog and the zoom feature worked well. The playback was easy to figure out, and we quickly hooked it up to our TV to test playback there. WOW, we were both impressed! The video was amazingly clear! The only thing we didn't like is that there is no image stabilization--hence only 4 stars (although if we could, we'd give it 4.5 stars). 

Once you hook the camera up to the computer (via flip out USB) it prompts you to load the software. We were worried it might not work in Vista, but it worked flawlessly. There are very cool movie modes that can be used to alter your video--for example it will change your video to a "nostalgic" old-timey look (complete with frayed film edges, sepia tone, and period theme music). Of course, you can leave the video as-is as well!

This is definitely a keeper! This is the perfect camera to carry with you if you want to catch some quick action--like pets or kids--or family events since it can capture up to one hour. It is also a great camera for non-geek or non-technical people...everything is pretty much self explanatory and takes just a few clicks. You will not be sorry you purchased this camera!

I did a ton of research on High definition camcorders and settled on the Canon Vixia HG20 HDD.  The camera is easy to use, the pictures look great, and the hard drive has tons of space - even at the highest quality setting.  I have a Mac, and the video clips imported very easily using iMovie and the photos imported right into iPhoto.  I didn't even bother to install the software that came with the camcorder.
My only disappointment is that the camera does not come with a battery charger - so you either have to buy one on your own, or you have to plug the camera in to charge it.
Aside from that...I could not be happier with this purchase!!

I love this stuff.  My 9y/o cat broke his leg when he was a kitten and has a fused knee. This causes him stress and pain, esp when it gets cold. I put him on cosaquin a little over a month ago ans he is doing great. He now jumps up into the window seals and chases our other cat all over the place. All I do it sprinkle it on a little bit of soft food (he likes the flaky stuff, not the mushy stuff) and stir it in.  I'm going to keep him on this for life now.

This tool is absolutely the best I have ever used. My dog loves to be combed with it and has been infinitely more comfortable in this hot area of Georgia in the summer. My dog is a mixed breed of Golden Retriever and Basset Hound. His coat is primarily that of the Retriever with all that fluffy lighter hair on his hind legs and tail. Additionally, the removal of loose dander has really reduced that "doggy smell" that can be prevalent when vacuuming the house. This product is expensive and worth every penny. Get one immediately if you don't have one.

I was looking for Camcorder Which is easy to operate even for my parents. As they are not that much into computer, I decided to go for dvd camcorder. 

I seen the same range Canon and Sony camcorders. Problem with Canon Camcorder is it comes with many switches, which can turn into complex operations. I also believe that Optical image stabilizer is better than Electronic Image stabilizer.

This camcorder is coming with 42X optical zoom!! which is quite higher...It also comes with Advance O.I.S....When I seen the operation mode..

Trust me, it is very simple to use...even a kid can operate it. I made my mind and I just bought it. I went to India and show it to my parents. We bought Sony mini DVD-RW discs.  

When I seen the result of camera in 34 inch tv, I was so surprised with the video quality and sound quality....It was really good. I am pure technical guy and If I am looking for DVD camcorder option, I should say, this camera deserve its place. I strongly recommend this product. Thanks.

Classic movie. You may want to rent it first to be sure you like it, since it's one of those movies where some people love it and some people consider it poor quality and not funny whatsoever. I would definitely recommend it if you've ever been to Africa, especially if you've lived there for a longer period of time. I think it is pretty funny. It was filmed quite a while ago so the quality isn't fantastic. It does a good job of portraying the miscommunication and conflicts between men and women, humans and nature, as well as modernized humans and their interaction with the bushmen. If you've never seen it, grab a coke, sit back and enjoy!

Great filter for my cool mist humidifier!  I'm a smoker, and it snag's alot of the yuck from smoke out of the air - can see it in the yellowing of the filter fairly quickly.   I probably go through more filters than most during the winter season while the house is closed up, but seeing that yellowing sure makes the price low considering the talk about second hand smoke these days.   I have a cat, and can't help but think of how it's also filtering out allergens from it too.  The filter holds water nicely making the humidifier very efficient.  Could go on, but you get the idea.  Well worth the money.

This is a great product, I should have bought the 16 gig one nevertheless. The only problem with it is when you use it for readyboast. Once your format it (3.99 gb by the way) it is impossible to stop it. Everytime you plug the stick into your computer it immediately starts readyboast. Since it uses 4 gigs for readyboast I really only have a 4 gig thumbdrive. So what I will do is delete readyboast whenever I have to transfer files that are larger than 4 gigs. But you can only do this when you plug the stick into another computer, on the one that it is formatted for it will tell you that readyboast is in use so you cannot stop it or delete it.

I've had Drinkwell fountains for years and loved them, as did our cats.  Time for another one, and upgraded to the Platinum model.  It is bigger, with a better design in putting it back together after cleaning; however, it is really big.  You have to have a very large sink, or clean it in the bathtub.  It is very difficult to hold in one hand while wiping all the crevices with the other hand.  Putting a filled reservoir back on the fountain requires more graceful moves than I have, so water goes everywhere.  I liked the older model much better.

My experience with pedometers have been sketchy in the past.  Ones I have used prior would register drastically different step counts.  I was watching a program on television with the "You on a Diet" doctors, and noticed that the subjects were using this particular pedometer.  I thought that if they use it, perhaps it is accurate.  They were right.  

I counted my steps taken and compared it with the pedometer.  The count was on par with the Omron.  It registers both aerobic and walking steps and if you calculate your stride, it will tell you how far you've walked.  It's a great item and serves me well in my goal of walking 10,000 steps a day.

I recently was in the market for a new USB hub. After a lot of research I purchased this product. It is one of the best electronic devices that I have ever purchased. It has a sturdy construction and with the ability to stand up right, it saves a lot of desk space, and with the jump drive port on the front its the ultimate USB hub. I would buy it again any day.

I hate this new version! For years I've been able feel smug and superior by criticizing just how bloated and clumsy to use Office became in the late 1990s. For me, it was a textbook case in how not to make a user interface, particularly the many steps it took to change a style. "Heck," I'd tell people, "even InDesign with its incredible 26 palettes and dozens of pull-down menus is easier to use." 

Now I can gloat no more. By all accounts, Microsoft has cleaned up the interface wonderfully, with PC Magazine reporting, "Once you get past the few minutes needed to navigate the new Ribbon interface, you'll wonder why Microsoft waited so long to get so many things right." 

Now my only gripe is that I have to wait until fall for the Mac version.

This ipod is also a clip, so you can clip it onto your shirt, pants, or anything like that. It holds a few hundred songs, has good volume, comes in nice colors, and is great, and compact/small. But a few issues are: 

1) Its so small, that it can be easily stepped on, or easily ruined; water is also bad on it, even if its just a tiny bit of water that gets on it, it effects the quality.

2) These only live for about 1 year, while other ipods, last at least 2 or 3.

3) It doesn't have much music space, around 360, while the others have 2000.

4) You also don't get to have the screen, so no videos, podcasts, or games; this isn't an issue, but its a downfall.

5) It can get lost easily.


Even though your not paying too much for this, its still not worth the cost. I suggest getting an iPod Nano 8GB, its more money, but completely worth it. This is a good gift for a young child, but it will not last long, and it has a lot of weak spots that are easily met.

I hope this review helps some, :)

My wife and I have been spending a pretty penny at the local coffee shop, so I began looking for inexpensive home alternatives. Most of the coffee snobs claim you have to purchase a $200+ machine and $150+ grinder to have a decent cup of espresso. I turned instead to the frugal Italians. They did invent the stuff, afterall. My Bialetti Moka Express coffee pot came this afternoon. I was a little concerned that a $20 pot might not meet the high standards of the gourmet beverages wifey and I have become accustomed to. I was wrong. The brew made by this ingenious little pot is a little weaker than "pumped" espresso and lacks the foamy cap (crema) that all the snobs rave about, but mixed with some hot, frothed milk and a bit of chocolate syrup I couldn't tell the difference between Bialetti and Seattle's Best.

This rich brew comes from a tiny little aluminum contraption with no moving parts, no electronic gizmos, no pump handle and virtually no wait time or clean-up. You just fill, brew and pour. It's that simple. Its base only covers half of the stovetop's smallest eye and I expect it will be easy to store due to its diminuitive size. I've already had three cups of homemade mocha today, and I've only had the pot since noon! *jitter jitter* The point is this: If you're a coffee lover who is bored with Folgers from a Mr. Coffee drip machine or is spending way too much at Starbucks, the Moka pot is an inexpensive and easy-to-use alternative with excellent results.

I love this product and litter system.  Originally purchased the system on QVC but buy my cartridges on Amazon because it's cheaper (plus free shipping if you've signed up and this stuff is heavy).  I have one cat - a Cornish Rex - who is very, very fussy where she goes.  With regular litter boxes, she'd leave a mess if not scooped every day by backing up to hang over the box.  Yulk.  This system is perfect for her and me.  I don't scoop and it lasts the entire month.  Around the 20th day, I take a scooper and remix the litter pellets in the main area (not under the lid).  Then, you have the fresh smell until day 31.  Whoever invented this system was a genius.

I read in Bicycling magazing that riders who ingest protien within the first 15 minutes of completing a ride, have faster muscle recovery rates and are in better shape for the next day.

Last year I was always sore the next day after a long ride.  After reading this article, I box some Clif Builder Bars due to their high protien content (20g).  I have since been religiously eating them after each ride.  I have yet to have sore muscles yet this year.

In one of the local stores there is a Chocolate Mint flavor.  It is yummy.

Without doubt, this is the best electronic razer currently on the market.

In the past, I have had three problems with electronic shaver systems:
1. Cleaning 
2. Failing to shave close enough/missing hair 
3. Pinching

As far as cleaning, this product is top notch. It requires next to no maintenance except exchanging a cleaning pack (which will run you less than $5.00 a month). I shave every day and run my model on ECO clean and my pack last right at two months.  

They have definitely improved on how close the razor shaves to your skin and how much hair the razor misses. I hair on my neck grows in random directions and is not consistent. Out of my whole neck, there are probably 4-5 hairs that grow in such a way that prevent this shaver from being able to shave them... but this is easily taken care of with 1-cleanup-swipe from a Mach 3. Overall, I'd say there is room for improvement, but under no circumstances should that prevent you from purchasing this awesome shaver.

As far as pinching, this shaver has yet to pinch me, pull my hair or cut my in anyway. 

Overall, I'd say this joker is top notch. Hopefully soon, a private company will be smart enough to come out and sell the special alcohol that goes in the refill stations, so you can recycle them and spend a lot less on maintenance.

We've had a Starbucks Barista Aroma Grande for a few years and it makes great coffee but is too tall to fit on my counter tops at our new home.  We bought this to replace that one, and picked it primarily based on looks/size, features and price.  I love it.  The controls look a little confusing at first (the vintage design is really cute though), however, it turns out to be very easy to use and program.  I love the adjustable hot plate temperature feature. Also, the carafe doesn't drip when you pour coffee, and most importantly, the coffee tastes great.  Auto shut-off and programmable start time is a must for me and this has it.  It also has a 12-cup capacity which is important for an addict like me.  I highly recommend it!

We finally stopped swaddling and transitioned our baby to a regular sleep sack. He kept waking up with very cold hands. I ordered this because it was the only sleepsack I could find with long sleeves, and we've had two glorious nights where he's slept through the night without a peep. Now, I can't say that the sleepsack with arms will work for every baby, but it's very cuddly and warm, and that seems to work for him. The zipper starts at the bottom of the sack and zips up from there, but there is a little flap to keep zipper hidden at the top. It seems well constructed, hopefully it will stand up to washing while staying just as soft. I just wish it came it a bigger size, or in vibrant colors. For the price though, it certainly seems to be more than worth it. Our sleeveless sleepsack has now been retired!

Not only does this hold all of my music, but it also provides notepad, todo list, internet connection, address book, calendar, weather forecasts, radio streaming, dictionary, medical database, CIA factbook, maps, buying guides, eBook reader with several books, calculator, budgeting, and a variety of games for those times I'm waiting in line or for a meeting.  Granted, some of these apps are add-ons, but they are inexpensive.

This all fits in my pocket.  It allows me mobility without carrying a laptop around.

The interface is easy and customizable.  The iTunes desktop link is slick - provides backup, customizable synching, and even does a factory setting restore with one click.

I bought two of the free agent 1 TB drives and I had a problem with one of them un-mounting for no reason. I called Seagate and they are in the process of replacing that drive. The drives are the fastest I have ever used and you can play back video in realtime. They are beautiful, small and nice looking. They do not have a switch to turn on or off which is unusual to me but I didn't have any trouble with them mounting and they are very responsive when I am using them. I think they are a great buy and am looking forward to long time use of the drives. They are backed by a five year warranty from Seagate.

I got my pink 8 GB a few weeks ago and I absolutely adore it.  I also have a 160GB Ipod which does wonders, but because of the bulk and size of the 160GB I can't put it into my pockets, and when I put it into my purse and absent mindlessly set my purse down my ears buds get yanked out of my ears in a painful way.  So I've tried to combat the problem by carrying it in my hand, or using a case with a clip, still uncomfortable and the cases were blocky and unappealing.  Unfortunately while waiting for the bus I would get many looks of "I'm going to steal your Ipod." Never fun.

So I decided to pick up this little gem, fits in my pocket, the battery life is wonderful at about 24 hours, the screen is surprisingly clear and bright.  It's so slim it can fit anywhere.  The features are great, being able to shake your Ipod and have it switch to another song is a quirky fun idea.  You have to give it a good shake.

For those who are worried about the cover art kicking in, or while running or jogging it switches to a different track..you really shouldn't worry!  I'm trusting that fellow Ipod users know to switch it into hold mode whenever it is in your pocket, (or wherever else) due to the click wheel being able to turn the vol up and down and your battery draining in case a surface, like the inside of your pockets rubs up against it and makes the backlight be on constantly.  I use to put any of my older ipods straight into hold mode as soon as I was done picking a song.

It's the same with this little player, put it on hold mode and cover flow will not be turned on when your player rests sideways, as well as the shake and switch feature will not comply, so you can run, jog and do whatever without having to worry.

This is a solid player, portable, with all the great vibrant colours, you can pick your favourite.

It does feel quite fragile however for being so thin, but there are many great case choices online to combat this.  Clear plastic cases that don't add so much bulk or block the colour/style of the player will do the trick!

This camcorder is a simple way for you to share videos with friends and family, make and share mini-movies, capture special moments, or film your next masterpiece for YouTube or Amazon.com.

Pros:
1.	The "cool" factor is off the scale.  Every time I showed it to somebody, they said "COOL!!!"

2.	It uses two AA batteries that are easy to install.  There's a latch at the bottom of the camera - one side has a picture of a closed lock, and the other has a picture of an open lock.  It doesn't get simpler than that, does it?  Push towards the open lock and slide off the panel on the front of the camera from just under the lens.  After you put in the batteries, slide the panel back into place and push the latch back to the locked position.  You're now ready to start filming.

3.	There are very few buttons required to operate the camera.  Turning it so that the side with the big red button is facing you, the on/off switch is on the right side of the camera.  After powering up, the screen will light up with the Flip logo and then it will indicate that it's ready. At this stage you'll be looking at whatever's in front of you, with a time check at the bottom telling you how much video time you have left.  

4.	Filming is easy - just press the red button to start, and press it again to stop.  The camera will save your creation, tell you how long it is and how much time you have left.  You can zoom in and out by pressing the + and - signs on top of and below the red button. The microphone will pick up and record whatever's going on at the time.

5.	Playback is a one button operation.  

6.	Deleting your mistakes is a one button operation.

7.	You can scroll through your videos by using the arrow keys to the left and right of the red button.

8.	Getting it on your computer is the easiest part.  With the red button facing you, pull down on the latch on the left side, and - surprise!!!  Out pops a USB arm which you then connect to your computer.  Once you're linked up, the Flip Video software will show you the way home.  (It takes a while to pop up)  Choose the option to view your videos, and agree to the terms and conditions, and then the "Muvee Video Mixing Software" begins loading.  This is a one time installation.  From there you can easily play, name, edit and share your videos.

9.	You can also capture still shots from your videos, but you can't use these when making your movies with the software provided.

10.	There is an option for making a movie, where you can arrange your edited videos, choose from a selection of six movie styles and music, or even add your own music.  Choose your style, click on the "Make Mix" button, and the computer does the rest.  If you're happy with the results, you can save the file.

11.	The camera comes with a wrist strap, a velvet drawstring case, and also the necessary cables to connect it to your television for a bigger view.  There's also a place to connect a tripod.

12.	There is a "Help" feature included with the software.

Cons:
1.	Being a simple "point and shoot" camera, the resolution isn't fantastic, but quite good enough for action shots.  Forget detail close-ups such as words and logos - zooming in and out will just get you various degrees of blurry.

2.	You'll need to be careful with background noise, as the microphone will pick up the sound of your fan or your stomach growling.

3.	The video editing capability is limited to the length of the video you want to save, and the order you want to save it.  There are no options for titles, fade ins or outs or any bells and whistles.  If you're filming yourself giving a speech, you'll pretty much have to get it right in one complete take.

4.	As with all videos, if your hands shake, you'll need to get a tripod, or you may make a lot of people seasick. 

5. If you have big fingers, you may have some problems with the red button. Once your finger covers the area around the button, you'll have trouble starting and stopping the video.  If you can't get it to work, you may have to use just a fingernail, because if you press anywhere other than dead center of the red button it won't start or stop.


Overall, this is a very good camcorder if used for the purpose for which it is intended.  It isn't going to make you the next Stanley Kubrick, but it's a good start.

I was skeptical to buy this at first, since some of these reviews said it was overrated.  The high rating and a recommendation from a close friend won me over though, and I'm glad I purchased this brush.

The brush looks like it doesn't do much, but it really does.  I removed about 3 pillows worth of fur from my Husky the first time I used this.  His coat looked more rich and healthy afterward and he stopped overheating as much, which is important since I recently moved to Orlando.

This product is definitely better than all other brushes, and the price can't be beat for the value of the product.  Make sure you use it outside!

I've been putting this powder on my bichon frise's food for a few months now, skipping a few days here and there, and really only a little bit of powder (since it's so expensive), and it's made a HUGE difference in his appearance!  I am very, very pleased with this product, it really does work and his face is now almost completely white.  No more ugly brown stains all over his beard!  I think he's not tearing as much, or at least it's just not noticeable anymore.  Others have noticed the change too.  Don't hesitate to try this, it's worth it.

Great product and I would recommend this hub to anyone that is in need of increasing their conectivity with 7 2.0 ports easily accessible.

The product is a Cuisinart and if you go directly to their website you can order all you want of these filters (www.....com).  In fact, the manual that came with my coffee maker, list all of the assessories (which includes the water filters), the company's telephone number, website, etc.  How much simpler could it be??

Humans left the uninhabitable earth 700 years ago to live in luxury aboard huge space ships.  Left alone on the planet was Wall-E, a little robot who endlessly collects trash, compacts it, and stacks the cubes in sky-high stacks.  He finds some interesting things in his job, but every night as he watches the romantic songs from his video of "Hello, Dolly!" he wishes he could find someone to love. 

I wasn't prepared for how moving this wonderful movie would be. The early scenes showing Wall-E painfully alone and longing for love are absolutely heartbreaking.  Happily, love does come in the form of a robot named Eve.  Much of the movie is without dialogue and when it does come, it's very short and very sweet: 

"Eva?"
"Wall-E?"
"Eva!!"
"Wall-E!!!"

There's lots of fun and high-speed action aboard a huge spaceship and some guilty insights into the future of mankind (fat, lazy slobs catered to by robots).  With humor, romance, thrills, and above all, a loveable trash-compactor named Wall-E, this is a movie all ages can enjoy.  (Bring your tissues!)

I bought this coffeemaker because it is rated #1 by Consumer Reports. I am a very satisfied with the taste of the coffee it brews. However, I do have a few minor complaints. First, the coffee isn't as hot as I'm used to. It's not that I expect the coffee to burn my tongue, I just want it to be a little hotter. Second, the timer only goes for 2 hours, so after 2 hours it automatically shuts off and I'm left with cold coffee. Third. it doesn't signal you when the coffee is finished brewing. Maybe I'm spoiled by my old Braun coffeemaker which had a 4 hour timer and beeped 4 times when the coffee was finished brewing. Lastly, the water doesn't always all brew out of the reservoir, so when I open the cover to remove the grounds, some water spills on my countertop. Overall, because of the great pot of coffee it brews, plus the great price I paid, I do recommend this coffeemaker.UPDATE...After approximately 3 months of use, the coffeemaker became EXTREMELY LOUD and made popping noises. Black and Decker sent me a replacement coffeemaker for free, BUT it wasn't this model. I'm guessing that there's a recall in the future for this coffeemaker, so I can no longer recommend you buy it. The replacement I received, model # BCM1410B brews good coffee, but it's cord is too short (I needed an extension cord), and it's display is not lit well.

We got this item as a wedding gift and we have loved it!  For one just as a toaster it works great you just push the button for toast and pull the latch down to start it up.  If you're like me and you like Sausage Egg Mcmuffins from McDonalds what is better than being able to make your own from home.  You put the English muffin in its slot than put water in the bottom of the egg part followed by the egg pan and than you put the rack for the sausage put the plastic cover on push the button for the complete thing pull the lever down and let it do the rest.  I love how it knows exactly when to start toasting the English muffin so it is all done at the same time.  You can also just cook an egg in this if you don't want toast.  All and all a great contraction.  I gave it 4 stars though as the area where you put the water rusts over very quickly.

The strainer basket with the blades cleans easily and quickly if you put some dishwashing soap on it and the brush then scrub each section of the wire mesh rinsing it under running water as you go around the basket. The large feeding tube and powerful motor makes it easy to put 2 - 3 carrots in at the same time. As far as noise, I've found that it's no louder than my blender. I make carrot, apple and celery juice then put the juice in the blender where I add 1 tsp barley grass powder, a few dashes of cinnamon and cayenne pepper, some bee pollen, 2 scoops of protein powder, 1 small tomato and a few strawberries. After blending a few seconds, you have a super delicious and healthy drink. What you can do with this juicer combined with a blender is only limited by your imagination.

This was a present from a friend and I love it based on its functionality and available space.  There is synchronization software which I have yet to play with to see how it works but when used as a conventional flash drive you can fit a little bit of everything.  As a writer and photographer I tend to carry a lot of word documents and photos around with me since I am always doing something with them.  This allows me to finish the work I am involved in without running low on space.  Given I also work as a technician, I was able to keep full downloads of some application freeware I often need access to.

Its a sleek design and glows royal blue when its active.  Like most Flash USB's you need to do the proper ejecting method so u dont lose your files and it comes with a lanyard cord and pocket clip.  A worthy purchase for the technophile or someone who just needs space.

We wanted a top quality mixer ,but had little counter space.We also wanted  plenty of power for cookie dough and sometimes bread dough this does it all, power ,comfort and low noise .Wished we had it  years ago. Oh, the dough hooks are a must if your bake your own bread. The beaters just about clean themselves,great product!

This works much better than Frontline or Frontline Plus, when there is a serious flea and or tick outbreak in the area we remain unaffected. While using Frontline PLus we did have good control on fleas but the ticks were immune to it. Ticks lose the fight with Advantix, it kills them so fast that even if I do see one on the dogs it is already dead! Using for two years now...

I own 3 Lacie drives and will certainly buy more.
Nice looking, and these are the perfect shape to stack and store.  No harware problems yet.
I would mention however, that the Lacie drives I've purchased all had to be formated before I could use them (I'm usuing Windows xp).  The factory format did not allow large files over 2 gig.  No biggie.

Theres not much to say about this product, it does what it claims. It is a cheap 512 mb usb flash drive that works just a well as any other more expensive model. It is a far better for jobs that were once reserved for floppy drives. Much faster, and about 350 times the memory. I personally use mine for my digital media technology, advanced drafting, and A+ certification classes at my high school and it is great for all of them. Large photoshopped pictures, audio, video, autocad files, all of them transfer nearly instantly onto the compact cruzer micro.

This is an excellent show with great actors. The plot is so different and while watching in on Showtime it had me on the edge of my seat. I love the show and couldn't wait for the second season which was also excellent. I am now waiting for the third season to begin. I love Michael C. Hall and the other characters are also very good. Dexter's character was so different from the one Michael played on Six Feet Under. He is very, very good. Everyone I know that has watched the show loves it too. I will be purchasing all the seasons as they become available and hope it is on for a long time.

It is a bit tricky to download videos to computer.  Seems to take awhile and is also, I've heard, very fragile.  However, we are enjoying using it and love the portability and size.  The skins and soft pouch accessories do not fit this camera.  We had to use an existing camera case of our own to protect it from bumps if it is accidently dropped.  Still experimenting with it.  So far it is a good value and we hope it lasts a long time.  Fun to use.

I  like this computer very much. It is small enough to go into my purse. It was  easy to set up, gets the interent and is fairly fast.  The long battery( 5 hours vs teh 3 hour  one in the   120gb version)  last adequately. It has no dvd/cd drive so it is  not as easy to install new software. I would not recommend this as your only computer, but as a computer to   take  on the road   it is great.  the screeen is  easy to see and the computer  so far works  great.  I am very pleased with it.

I have that annoying hair that is definately not straight, but just has enough of a wave to be frizzy instead of curly. This straightener works so well; I used to use a hot tools one until my stylist used this one on me @ an appointment...I bought one that day! It's super easy and works great as long as you section out your hair into smaller pieces. It also works as a great curling iron; you just start at the root of your hair and clamp down, then, while holding the iron closed, just twist the straightener as you pull it through your hair to the tips...it makes a really tight spiral curl that you can leave tight or pick out...all of my friends come to my house to get ready before we go out, JUST to use my iron haha...It is definately worth the investment and it makes your hair really silky!

I hadn't tried Outlook before, so unlike other reviewers, I can't compare this to previous versions. The program is a little slow, but I've come to expect that from Microsoft products. Microsoft does plenty of things well; being fast is not one of them. Still, for a small business, the Outlook program is great. The interface is easy to use and the program is quite intuitive. Oh, and I had Word 2007 previously installed in my computer, so I had no problem using things like spell check.

The KitchenAid 9-speed hand mixer, is a great choice to make. It makes baking much easier, and cleaner. I love it's slow to start speeds, so it keeps the dough and mixes in the bowl and reduces the splatter, and it's no loud like many mixers, and it offers a speed slection(digital), which is nice, and most importantly is that it is fast. A must have in everyones kitchens this year.

I was hoping they would be good as a healthy snack and they are but best of all THEY TASTE GREAT. It is like biting into a nice fresh tasting granny smith apple. Sweet and  tart at the same time. Chewy enough to give you a nice bite but not tough at all. More like a soft licorice.
   I just love that they are not overly sweet. That has always been my problem with these fruit snacks. And just to put the icing on this cake, they are all organic and only 70 calories so they fit nicely into my healthy diet. I slip one into my purse for a nice snack and I also get in one fruit serving for the day.
      Good JOB Clif Bar and Com. LOVE THEM

These Chuckit Ultra balls are a great toy and have lasted so far 5 months without looking anything but new. Our puppy used to play with and chew on tennis balls until we found out the glue in tennis balls is bad for his health, not to mention, we always had chunks of green fuzz all over the house to vacuum up. No need to worry with these balls!  The rubbery surface holds up to our 8-month old's sharp teeth, and provides endless fun as he chases them around the yard. The bright orange color is easily discernible even outside in the grass, and we can easily find it again and again. I highly recommend these balls.

I've had my Sammy for three months now.   I upgraded to 2gb ram, and have XP Home and Windows 7 dual booted. It runs Windows 7 really, really nicely.  In fact, I get better battery

There's so much to like about this little netbook.  It's fast and agile (I'm running Photoshop CS on it with no problems).  I read books on it, shop, download and enjoy music and movies, and do my banking.  It's really convenient if I'm reading a book and need some insight or watching a movie and want to know what I've seen that actor in before. 

I had a little trouble with the Synaptic touchpad's scrolling feature, so I disabled it.

It's pretty near perfect for what I want in a convenient little computer.

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that the speakers leave a little to be desired.  Surely they could've placed them to project forward instead of down, and they could've  used a little better hardware for the price.

I got this for my wife's computer.  It was running on an old 802.11b card and needed to upgrade to the g.  I installed it.  The antenna sits on top of her CPU.  I'm not sure if the external extended antenna is better or just that this is a 'g' card, but her wireless has a much better connection.  I purchased this for the price, and it has been worth it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars vs. 5 is because the setup is slightly different than the ones I've used in the past (D-link and Netgear).  The other 2 companies have a bit clearer setup instructions.

As far as negative reinforcement is concerned, this product is extremely effective.  I HAD a 17-month-old thumbsucker who was so attached to her thumb that her top teeth were starting to buck.  I had already tried several other tactics with no positive results.  My brother recommended Mavala Stop, so I tried it.  

The first night was rough on my daughter (and on us), but she very quickly stopped the thumbsucking.  The next day, however, she discovered her OTHER (non-treated) thumb, so I applied more Mavala.  In hindsight, I probably should have just painted both thumbs from the start.

Anyway, after reading another reviewer's comments, I had only put a tiny bit on the tip of my daughter's thumbnails.  I found it didn't last long that way, so just ended up painting the entire thumbnail on both hands.  Since then, I've been thrilled to see that the habit is completely gone.  This product is perfect for ending thumbsucking.  I couldn't be happier with the results.

This story will not need to be re-done due to this most excellent and moral depiction of relationships from our history and the young men (and woman) who founded our country in relationship to God. What Roots did for Black Americans when I was a child, this does for all Americans in relationship to all of our past struggles and sins and it can easily become the foundation for any american movie collection. Thomas Jefferson was a treat to see up close and personal and when John & Abigail reunite with their children as adults after so many years of seperation, even Jesus wept. The musical score is also superb in that it seduces us to either join or die ... well done Tom and we thank you.

Coffee made with Keurig & K-cups is the best I've ever tasted - anywhere!  

Unlike "pod" machines (like the Senseo&trade; by Philips) this coffee does not taste unbalanced or rushed nor does it have that annoying foam on top -- even though the brewing time is similarly fast.  

Many models will come with an k-cup assortment of coffees and teas, giving you the opportunity to find your favorites before ordering a whole box. (Green Mountain coffees are especially good!)

Keep in mind that you can also use regular tea bags, hot cocoa, or any other instant hot beverage just by omitting the k-cup and sending hot water into your mug.

You won't regret spending a little more to get the very best!

This edition of Quicken has several features that are exclusive to Mac users. Quicken lets the user keep a comprehensive record of their finances. You can have access to all your assets and liabilities right at your fingertips.  I first used Quicken 5 in 1994 and have progressed up to this current version. I have always found the software to be accurate and useful. With each new version it has become more user friendly. I have always found the UserGuide to be well written, easy to understand and simple to navigate in by using the index. I have been doing personal financial records since 1949 it certainly has become easier with tools such as Quicken 2007 for Mac.
	Quicken continues to make your year end report to IRS much easier. If you are vigilant when setting up your accounts and entering your transactions as to payee and category the following reports are a breeze. Managing your bank accounts and credit cards. The QuickFill(tm) feature remembers each transaction and/or category you enter, so you only have to type recurring transactions once.  Reconcile your Quicken accounts to make sure they agree with the bank/credit card statements. Transfer money between Quicken accounts. Quicken records the transfer in both  accounts  and updates your balances automatically. Schedule any transaction---from car payment that you pay every month, to an insurance premium that you pay twice a year, to a Permanent Fund direct deposit. When the bill/deposit rolls around, Quicken either reminds you about it or simply enter it for you automatically---whichever you prefer. 
	A new Payroll feature is added in Quicken 2007 allowing you to enter and track the information contained in your family's paychecks in a simple to use, intuitive interface. Armed with this additional information, you will better track account balances and investments contributions. It can also empower you to make smarter decisions and open enrollment choices. What a great management tool.
	With the click of the mouse on QuickReport  in the Quicken toolbar, you can create a report of any account or category that you specify in the date range you specify---utility costs, groceries, medical expenses, etc.   A word on the tool bar. The user can configure the tool bar to meet their requirements. Again Quicken has made this an effortless procedure. 
	All of the above functions are also available in similar fashions for tracking investments----401k, stocks, bonds and savings. Click on Reports in the tool bar to create a Net Worth Statement , Capital Gain/Loss Statement, cash flow report, income state and others. Several of these can be created in form of a graph also. Again any questions can usually be found and answered by using the UserGuide  Come income tax time, the required information can be imported into Turbo Tax to prepare your tax return. 
	Quicken has the ability to down load and input your investment statements, bank statements and credit card statements over the internet from the financial institutions to your accounts. I, however have not been unsuccessful downloading this information I get a message `cannot create file' when I attempt a download. I suspect that my G3 iMac may be the reason. To old. However, I am comfortable continuing imputing my information manually.  Putting that aside, the Investment software is excellent in displaying the information on all of my accounts.  In the Portfolio in the Investments section it will display the quote/price, cost basis, cost basis/share, gain/loss, market value and other. Although I was unable to download, I did check to see just how many financial institutions that we do business with were supported for Quicken downloads.  I found 10 out of 15 were. Quicken stated that they are adding more institutions every day. The claimed  850 financial institutions have added connectivity to Quicken in the past year alone.
	Quicken will also enter transactions from your PDA. I do not use a PDA, so had no occasions to experiment with this feature, or the a trial version of Pocket Quicken. [...].
	One great addition was the Mac OS X Dashboard widget. You do not have to open your Quicken program in order to record a transaction. Just enter it on the Quicken widget. You can enter as many different transactions as you wish. Then, when you do open you Quicken program, there they are. Neat! I was unable to enter a split transaction in the widget, which would be nice. This is only a minor inconvenience, though.
	Some of the other features are the ability to back up data to online .Mac account.  Add due date to your iCal calendar. the advantages never end. 
	I highly recommend this software for personal record keeping. Quicken continues to improve their software and make it Mac friendly. This edition for 2007 is much appreciated.
	Quicken is flexible enough to let you track as many as 255 accounts in one file.
It also will allow the user to have more than one file. I  maintain some additional personal files for information that I want to keep separate from the others. You can copy selected transactions as well as information such as categories, classes, budget amounts and securities to your new file.
	There are other features that I did not mention in this review.

I just got this in the mail and it's exactly what I expected -- light, fast, easy to use, except the keyboard and mouse, which will take some getting used to. The only annoying surprise: It actually comes with a sleeve, which was the only thing not listed under the "in the box" section. I suspect this is because Amazon sells its own sleeves for $20 plus shipping, and it came immediately. Now I have to figure out how to return it even though I already threw out the box.

For about 7 years I owned Linksys(now Cisco) wifi routers, including the excellent WRT54G. (I also had one D-link that was not very good at that time). In early 2008 I decided to upgrade to an N-router, but this last Linksys was a bummer, dropping the connection to the internet frequently and with a very poor actual range(WRT150N). So last february(2009) I went to pursue a new wifi router.

I researched a lot of opinions on the internet(websites, amazon,etc.), I was decided not to go with Linksys since their quality is declining, and on the end I decided to give D-link a try again with a D-LINK DIR-825 !

I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER WITH IT !!!!!

It has both 802.11g and 802.11n networks, dual band , at the same time but in two different radios frequencies(and two SSIDs), so you can have dedicated highspeed wireless network for video, etc and a 802.11g fast network for other stuff.

It is full gigabit with 4 ports(I am now using 3 and plan to use the fourth( 1 for a desktop, 1 for a notebook docking station, 1 for a 1 TB NAS and plan to use 1 for a PS3 which is now connected over wifi).

The print server is very neat and actually is a USB over the network, that allow you to access the USB device(whatever it is) through a client on multiple computers, so they recognize it as a USB device, not a network printer. This increases a lot the chance of working well with strange printers.

I also use a wifi skype phone regularly so my fianc閑 talk to her parents, and we can say that the internet connection does not drop anymore(at least one tenth of what happened with the Linksys).

You really should give this speed demon a try...On the smallnetbuilder tests it trounced the competition in throughput and I can say I experienced the speed bost myself:[...] 

And it is not thaaaaat expensive, I got mine for about USD 130. That for the perfect wifi router I always wanted. You can see a full review on the smallnetbuilder website here: [...]

so if in doubt, GET IT NOW !!!!

Best Regards
Bruno

PS:(I am not affilliated or anything to samllnetbuilder site, it was just the most detailed review I found when searching for routers back in february). I also DO NOT work for D-link or linksys. I am just using this product for over a month and I am completely satisfied.

I used electrics in the past - mostly Norelco style - used them since I didn't know any better... that's what I started shaving with.  A decade later and I had to use a real razor on vacation... man what a difference - the electrics couldn't hold a flame...... until now. 

I can't explain how well and how painless this shaver really is.  Quick - saves me time.  Painless - no after burn, no pulling hairs, gets the thickest patches of hair (my chin) without any ache (something my old electrics would tear me up so I'd have to go real slow to get it all)... Clean - self cleaning makes it like new everytime - just look at it after it's done - it's brand spanking new!  Sure the heads probably wear, but I've had it for over a month now and the thing is just like new.  I've read that the heads are supposed to be changed out every 18 months... what a savings in razors alone!!

Someone else on here said it made shaving fun - it really has.  I used to shave every other day since it took so long and I hated all the mess and hassle... now I want to shave twice a day :)  Sometimes I have... it really is great and comes with a nice travel container too.  Charge lasts a long time even on my thick stubbly face. 

I'm overly impressed with what this thing does to the basics of shaving... Can't recommend it enough!!

After using the Fresh Flow Cat Fountain for a few months, my cats have adjusted to it well and it seems to be working perfectly. My vet recommended a fountain for one of my cats due to a slight kidney problem and this really seemed to do the trick to get her to drink more water from her bowl instead of from the sink faucets. The entire fountain comes apart easily for cleaning with soap and water (about once a week will keep it running smoothly without clogs) and the adjustable pump works great.

For older Superman fans, the story line of Smallville (the seventh season)may look quite shocking, but as a hard core fan of the traditional Superman saga I found it fascinating, modern, intelligent.  What this series really does is explain, in a more scientific 21st century manner, the Superman legend. Older fans (50+)must understand that younger Superman followers required more Why?, How come?, and "please explain..." Our time was a little less demanding in those terms. The series is getting better with each season.  Every fan must give it a chance: it's well constructed, excellent story line and an above average special effects.  I enthusiastically recommended it.

This is the best pedometer I've ever used.  Unlike finicky pedometers, which have to be worn at just the right spot around your waist, this one seems to work anywhere.

This is my 4th 5lb tub of ON Whey. I have tried Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry and Double Chocolate. Double Chocolate is by far the best tasting of the four. Not that the others were bad by any means, they are all great tasting. The Double Chocolate is just far more superior. It satisfies the sweet tooth while suppling you with great protein and BCAA's.

Right before purchasing this product I had a BSoD in Vista, and the fact that I didn't have a backup hard drive scared me.  I was able to get everything back, but now I can look up to the shelf above my computer and see the trusty blue light of the sexy WD 750GB unit.  Occasionally it will blink as it does its thing...but otherwise it just sits there looking amazing.  It turns off with the computer, and Vista backs up my stuff every month right when i tell it to.  The only complaint I have with this drive, it was shipped with FAT16 i think, which didn't allow for DVD .iso's (cause they were to big).  I quickly reformatted to NTFS and no problems to speak of...
Get this drive- it looks nice, it's silent, and is a quality piece of tech.

One thing I really, truly like about Watchmen, that sets it apart from other works of superhero fiction, is the way it treats its heroes. They, on the most part, are fully aware of how silly dressing up in a theatrical costume and running around fighting crime is, and the more sane amongst them treat the enterprise as very tongue-in-cheek. With the exception of one hero they have no powers, and thus distinguishing between one hero or heroine and the next becomes highly character-driven rather than "oh he's the guy with the claws" or "oh he has the eye lasers".

Speaking of characters, the characters here are extremely well-written. Two examples:
 - Rorschach is a vigilante detective with a sordid past and a rapidly deteriorating psyche. By the opening of the story he considers his Rorschach persona to take presidence over his alter ego, and refers to his mask as his "face".
 - Doctor Manhattan, the only superhero with any real powers, is rapidly and dramatically losing his feelings of being human to the point of self-imposed exile from Earth. Described as a walking H-bomb, his withdrawal from Earth violently upsets the balance of power between the US and Russia, and threatens to start World War Three.

My only real beef with this novel, and the reason it only got 4/5 stars, is the ending. Though brilliantly orchestrated, it has a critical flaw in relation to real-world events, and you should stop reading now if you don't like spoilers.

The "villain", if he can even be called that, aims to stop WWIII by staging a massive attack on New York city that wipes out half the population, and makes it seem as if other attacks are imminent and that the world needs to ally against this new, perceived, and potentially permanent threat - and it works. My problem with this is that something to this effect actually happened, what with 9/11 and all, and the world sympathy only lasted for a period of a month or so, and then everyone went back to hating who they hated before. It's not really the fault of the authors that they mis-judged humanity's capacity for caring about each other, but it does kind of lessen the impact of the novel in this day and time.

This is a great pedometer.  I showed it to coworker and everyone wanted one!!!  My only complaint is that is the clip to attach to waist does not alway work, I would suggest using safety clip as well.  Some of the great features are the 7 day memory and the ability to see how many aerobic steps you have taken.  This sells for almost $40 at a local store and I was able to purchase on Amazon for less that $20 so great price as well.

This book in the Twighlight series is even better than the last. These books have that kind of "can't put it down" quality.

The best feature of this keyboard is not the lights, which are useful, its the feel. When I set it up, I immediately appreciated the feel of typing on a real keyboard as opposed to my laptop. When it gets dark out sometimes I'll flip on the lights just for the fun of it, but the keyboard has some keys that don't show well. That being said, the adjustable dimmer is a nice touch.
From what I can tell, if you don't mind contacting Saitek, you can easily have new keys sent so it shouldn't be a major deterrent unless you are too lazy to call up Saitek (like I currently am).
My suggestions to the developers would be to add a dimmer switch for volume instead of buttons, maybe add some programmable keys somewhere, and at risk of demanding too much- make it wireless/ bluetooth. I understand the power implications would require the keyboard to be charged more often, have batteries replaced often, or be able to dock... but it would be a nice option.

Our babies sleep through the night so MUCH better with the "noise machine".  My parents had one while I was growing up, and used it for about 20+ yrs... and so I bought one and then two more for the babies room and my son's room.  We have neighbors who work odd hours so they let their dogs out who bark continuously!!!  But, even through the day, the baby uses it for naps to block out unwanted noise from the other kids, lawn mowers, etc.  It is a GODSEND!!!!  Like I said, I own 3 of them.  Ohhhh, and the less expensive 1 setting model is just as good as the more expensive one.  No need to spend more, it works equally as well.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

It is really a good product for its price. There is no CD / DVD player and the keyboard could be a little larger (maybe with a lateral expansion or something similar). Otherwise, the notebook is practically ready to use, it has a great performance (and good disk space) and it is pretty easy to carry on. I could recommend it for those who are interested in downloading photos from a photo camera and sending them during a vacation trip, for example, just like I did!

I love this coffee pot. I bought it a month I looked at many before I decided to purchase this Cuisinart. It was pricey, but in the long-run it is worth the cost. I have made pot after pot of flavorful coffee. Clear with no sediments or oils like one can pick up through brewing in other pots. There has been no machine leakage or mess, no distortion of the machine lid from excessive steam escaping from the water heating unit. No burnt fingers for myself or my kids reaching across the counter to get a glass or bowl because the pot is a self contained unit and the pot fits inside its own cabinet and again there is no excess steam. Did I say it made great coffee. It makes great coffee! I definitely recommend the Cuisinart DCC1200 Brew Central.

In the warm summer months, when the temperature drops only a few degrees at night, we need something to go over our son's pajamas to keep him comfortable but not too hot. The Halo cotton sleep sack is the perfect solution. It is light-weight, breathable, and never bunches up around his face. It zips up from the bottom in case we need to do a quick diaper change and don't want to totally undress him. Sleep sacks are recommended instead of blankets to prevent SIDS, so it gives us peace of mind too. Be sure to order the right size for your baby - the sizes go by weight. They might look huge at first but your baby will grow into them (and out) faster than you think!

A great buy! Jam-packed with accessible information, beautifully packaged. Nice color photos. User-friendly layout. Small enough that I can throw it in a purse or carry-on. Doesn't waffle around, so to speak, but compares brand names,various grocery and restaurant menu items, etc. Example: think Oscar Mayer turkey bacon is more healthful than "regular" bacon? A 2-slice serving of each totals 70 calories with 6 grams of fat. However, the turkey bacon has 380 mg of sodium, while the America's Favorite Bacon tallies 290 mg of sodium.

"The only way love can last a lifetime is if it is unconditional." ~ pg. 46

I haven't seen the movie so I can't compare this book to the one read in the movie. I can however compare this book to numerous books I've read about marriage and I'm here to say that this is one of the best books you could ever read. Instead of dealing with superficial remedies this book goes for the heart of the matter and addresses spiritual growth within a marriage. 

Each "devotional" begins with a Bible verse and ends with a "dare." You can read the book two ways. You could read it all in one night, making notes about what you would like to try or simply read one dare a day. I chose to do the former and wrote down 21 ideas I would really try or have been trying. Since I read a lot of marriage books I was already trying out some of the ideas in this one. Some of the suggestions included: 

Buy something that says "I was thinking of you." 
Give a back massage - Massage Bar by LUSH
Say: "I choose to love you." 
Forgive
Be patient - not angry

While this can at times be a more serious book there is also some humor like "welcome to fallen humanity." Sometimes you just have to look at your marriage in a more humorous way, after all we are only human trying to reach for the divine. 

The advice in this book will not only make your marriage better it will also transform you from the inside out. You will literally become a more loveable person, therefore being more attractive to your mate. I loved the ideas in this book and wrote out my favorite dares on one sheet of paper so I could remember to follow the advice on a continual basis. If you are looking for more books on this subject, I can recommend:

I have two Cardigan Welsh Corgis, each which has a double coat.  The undercoat can be very thick and difficult to remove, so the dogs shed like crazy.  The large furminator has greatly improved the shedding so I'm not having to sweep or vacuum up "tumbleweeds" of hair every day.  They are also much more comfortable, I believe, in the summer heat and look great!  It's the best tool I've found for removing huge amounts of hair and is very sturdy, so it should last longer than many tools I've bought in pet stores.  I'm very happy with it and am glad my vet recommended it.

For me, choosing a product becomes difficult when you have hands on experience with both the commercial and household versions of a product. I look to reviews to see if the product will fit my well defined needs.
 
I bought this slicer to be able to make whole muscle jerky and other thinly sliced meat dishes. I generally work with raw meats and as such, the unit does the slicing and then comes apart for a thorough cleaning with relative ease.

With raw meat, getting the last little piece sliced with out slicing into the tips of the plastic holder was tricky. If the mold used to make this piece was beefed up a little (no pun intended) it would not flex when pressure was applied. This is the reason I give it a 4 instead of 5.

I really like this scale. It is very stury first of all. It is a little complicated to set up but once you read the directions, it makes sense. If you are the kind of person that simply wants to stand on a scale to see your weight, I wouldn't buy this one. My husband is that type and he prefers to use our other scale. But I love all the options of the Omron. It is very accurate and tells your weight, body fat % and BMI. Plus it tells you if you are in the underweight, healthy, overweight, or obese range. When you are the latter, it's not fun to see, but I wasn't surprised by the news. One thing I do like is you can by-pass all these options and just take your weight quickly (though it won't record it this way), but I like that option. For people who are trying to lose weight or really track their progress, I highly recommend this scale. I got the deal on the Omron pedometer ($10 off) when I bought them together. I'm trying to get in my 10,000 step per day. Up to 6000 so far. Hopefully, I'll get there.

First off the new design on the diaper is cool. Not to say the old one was bad but its nice to see change. Pampers still work #1 as always. I mean 9 months and not a single explosion evar! FTW! 

The Amazon Subscribe 'N Save makes it so much easier to deal with baby supplies like Pampers. Instead of having to drive around to find good deals or worry about "stock" at your favourite Tegrat store you just get your Diapers on schedule when you need them and the prices are extremely competitive.

Lastly having to lug around a huge box of diapers, fit them into the car, drive them home, and finally bring them in. That alone is a HUGE bonus to me. As they say time is money. I'd rather be spending my time with my baby at home rather than shopping.

Just to further complicate things, I have just bought this, in the 2.0 cover, clearly saying 2.0, identical in every way, except that it includes all the second series.

Would have been 5 stars, except for the fubar way this series was released, and the lack of decent extras (deleted scenes and nothing else).

While I'm mentioning deleted scenes, do watch them - i often don't bother but in this case they fill in a LOT of background, especially on Adama/Tigh.  The sheer volume of these especially for certain episodes makes me wonder if these were expected to be double eps and this was cut back?  Would also explain why the whole series is only 20 eps rather than the more usual 24-26.

Absolutely love this machine!  First off- it's very economical.  If you use amazon's subcription service for the K-Cups, you end up paying between 34 - 40 cents per cup of coffee.  I got this because I work in a very small office and it was such a pain making coffee each day.  There was always a squabble over who had to make the coffee, how strong, what flavor, emptying the pot, refilling the pot, when to start making the coffee, cleaning up the grounds, and washing things after.  With th Keurig machine, there's no fuss and no muss!  Your office stays clean, everyone has a fresh cup of coffee that's brewed the way they want it, and there's no need to head to starbucks and spend $3.00 each day!  Highly recommend it if your in a house or office with more than 3 people who drink coffee or tea.  It's even great for hot cocoa using the ghiradelli packs!

I made several batches of great tasting yogurt using this machine and each one turned out fine.  Each batch was made using an envelope of starter though which could get expensive.  I tried making a batch with some yogurt set aside from the previous batch but it didn't turn out, I think I waited too long and the culture died.  The thing is, you have to use up the starter yogurt within five days and I don't really want to eat a quart of yogurt every five days.  Unfortunately I can not buy plain yogurt containing cultures where I live so in order to have some plain yogurt I have to make it myself and use the freeze dried starter.  Anyway, the yogurt machine does exactly what it is supposed to do - I used only dry powdered milk and filtered water (plus culture) and had great results.  And even though the "timer" on top is rather simplistic, I find it very helpful to set it to tell  me when I began the batch.  Also I like that I can put the inner container with its own lid into the 'fridge.

This lively little book of truisms has a rather profound and serious kick to it that many will miss (as Oprah and Gail seem to have done) because they, as usual will see it as just another grand celebration of black motherhood and black womanhood. The book is funny but hidden in its subtext is a rather serious critique of the looseness and sexual promiscuity of black womanhood. Obviously only through comedy and only by a comedian could such a subtle but much needed critique be pulled off.

And in this regard, it is difficult not to notice too that in the black race, there is a serious bias towards praising black motherhood and denigrating black fatherhood. As we notice incessantly at TV sports celebrations, all of the high priced athletes are constantly "high-fiving" and busy thanking and praising God, apple pie and motherhood, and at the same time (and in stark relief), giving the "middle finger" to their usually "missing" fathers. No opportunities are missed to tear down and denigrate black men, black manhood and fatherhood at the same time that black motherhood is heaped with lavish and often undeserved praise. It has become just short of another meaningless mantra for the black race.

Both of these tendencies undoubtedly have deep historical roots that inexorably go back to Slavery. Historically American society has given and continues to give everyone, especially black women, wide permission to engage in this ultimately destructive race-base and gender-based reward and punishment social process. That is in part why no one gets alarmed at a 70%-plus illegitimacy rate in major U.S. inner cities among black women, while they howl about a million black men being incarcerated in American prisons. So long as both causes are comfortably attributed to "loose irresponsible" black men, no further investigation or study is needed: end of the story; end of the investigation of the social meltdown in the black community.

However, perhaps unwittingly, this very funny book pulls the wool from a carefully kept secret in the "Hood" that gets to the heart of the matter: It is wool that only a seasoned comedian like Harvey could have uncovered: that all of the real power in the black community, especially in the inner city, lies in the hands of black women. And that that power -- as the slave masters knew and as was reported in the infamous Willie Lynch memo -- lies in the Black women's ability to make up their own rules, and more importantly, to carry out the rules made up by others - in particular, in her ability to carry out the master's rules about social conduct, etiquette for children, and especially about sexual standards and behavior in the black community.  This is of course a theory about the historic roots of "black women power" in the black community. And while it may seem "dated" and even a bit "apocryphal," it still has an incontrovertible and deep and abiding resonance in the black community even today.

What Harvey tells us in the subtext of this very funny but at the same time very serious book of advice to women, is that black women, by being allowed to set the standards of social and sexual conduct in the black community, not only have all of the power in male/female relationships, but that after having all of this power, they somehow, continue to make colossally stupid mistakes in misusing it. Their main problem it seems is that they live in an echo chamber in which they are constantly only talking and listening to themselves. It seems that because they only listen to themselves, they have not learned the most elementary lessons needed to negotiate relationship terms with men, black men in particular.  As a result, they are continually finding themselves left bewildered, lonely and otherwise "holding the bag. " This process sadly can be generalized to all women.

Harvey's advice to them is simple, straightforward; almost automatic: "get outside of your own echo chambers and start thinking like a man and acting like a woman." Then he tells them how men think: They are fishermen and trappers: some women are keepers; others are to be thrown back. Men always have a plan. Find out early on what that plan is. If the plan is to "just kick, it," then, find a way to move on. How to act like a woman? Raise your standards and keep them high, men will eventually come around and will, over time, learn to respect and appreciate you more for it. What is left unsaid in the subtext is that, once these standards (which are completely controlled by black women) are raised, all of the social problems caused by promiscuity in the black community will then quickly abate. In relief, and deep in the subtext, the book is suggesting that most of the social problems in the black community are problems of sexual promiscuity by black women.

But in addition to this larger much deeper bottom line "take away" message, Harvey also makes clear in the same subtext that there are both "buyers" and sellers" in the relationship market place. Women too often emerge from their echo chambers as readymade "sellers," only looking for a "qualified buyer" to complete their personal marketing transaction. The last thing they want, are likely to recognize, or, are willing to settle for, is a black man who is himself also a "seller," in search of a "buyer" for has his own relationship marketing plan. 

Thus, this negotiation between two "sellers" is dead on arrival, destined to go nowhere, but because women tend to listen to, and believe in, only themselves, invariably they do not recognize that their male suitor is, like them, also a "seller," and thus the negotiation reduces to one in which the male suitor, realizing that he can "score a little booty" by willingly scraping his own plan, "pretends" to be the "mythical buyer" his female date is so desperately seeking.  The man's rationale is simple but lethal: Since she doesn't even recognize that I exist, that is, that I too have a plan, then she obviously is not a "keeper," so I might as well go for a "score," that is, get the "booty." Period.

I've had this laptop for about 3 months and I love it.  It's generally fast, has good features, is light and slick looking. It's not too heavy to carry around and comes with an extended battery.  

The keyboard also has an especially cool feel. Really! I know that sounds silly, but it makes all the difference. I'm so spoiled by the feel of my laptop keyboard that I don't like typing on standard keyboards anymore.

I'd like to take off half a star because I think the touch-pad mouse gets too hot on occasion, and the battery lost some of it's battery life. (It's still got 4 1/2 hours, though.)

It's definitely worth buying!

Excellent Kitty Fountain!  There are some cats in this world that are water cats (I just found out it's a certain breed) and my cat is one of them. Always jumping on the counter to try to get water out of the facet, I wanted that stopped.  So I bought this and no more counter jumping!  She loves the sound and the water and it makes her drink more as well.

For those people with Renal or Diabetes Kitties, this is a must have (as long as they already enjoy water sounds). However you can make it sound softer with water levels.  Keep the hair out of the bowl and clean it every few days (would you drink out of a cup after a few days of water in it, rushing or not?).

Just recieved this today so I cannot comment on the key wear issue, but the keyboard is very solid compared to any other I have used. The backlighting is strong enough for me; (I am typing now with the monitor as the only light in the room). I do not use this keyboard for gaming, so I cannot comment on that, but for ordinary typing, and surfing, it is perfect....AND FUN TOO! I have read that the late-production keyboards have been upgraded to prevent key wear...let's see; but even if they do wear, the company will gladly replace any worn keys for free...for me, at least, the look and feel of this keyboard is so nice that I don't care about replacing keys if I have too. Sofar as keystrokes, it has a perfect balance of travel and spring..."quiet keys" are nice too. GO 4 IT!

I used to scoff at froth! I never understood the whole flavored, whipped coffee frenzy. Then a friend made me a cup of coffee that changed my opinion.  I found I just didn't enjoy my plain old cup of coffee anymore, so I purchased the Aerolatte.  In the beginning, I thought I would only froth on weekends, as a little treat. But this gadget is so easy to use, I have wonderful frothy coffee every morning; it feels like such a luxury. It did take me  few tries to get the froth just right. I experimented with the volume of milk I was using, how hot I got the milk, and how long I "frothed."  I went from wimpy foam to a froth that glistens atop my coffee mug. Practice made perfect. Now I am going back to buy more for gifts!

This review is from: The Princess Bride (Special Edition) (DVD)

      



This movie holds a very special place in my heart. Rob Reiner does a brilliant job of directing a very talented cast in this incredibly witty comedy/romance/adventure/fantasy. Starring Cary Elwes as Westley, Robin Wright as Buttercup, and a slough of other wonderful actors and actresses, The Princess Bride contains a quotable line per minute, if not more! (Trust me, there are thousands of people who know EVERY line!)

This is the story of the incredible depths that a man will go in order to rescue the one he loves. Westley, thought dead, comes out of nowhere to rescue Buttercup from her kidnappers (played brilliantly by Shawn Wallace, Mandy Patinkin, and Andre the Giant!) but also from the evil prince (Chris Sarandon) who intends to use her in his attempt to start a war with a bordering country. He uses a combination of agility, swordplay, strength, savvy, and courage to overcome even the seemingly impossible.

And of course, who can resist the cleverness of the interjection scenes between a sick boy (Fred Savage) and his grandfather (Peter Falk) who is narrating the story to him!

Chock full of brilliant actors, wonderful one-liners, wonderful action, heart-swelling romance, and gut-splitting comedy, The Princess Bride is fun for the whole family, and is a timeless classic that will be enjoyed by viewers for generations to come.

I bought the camera as a gift for someone. I am an International buyer so I was amazed that Amazon shipped the package in less than a week. 

The person I bought it for is in love with the camera. They love the size, the fact that it's HD and that it's also their personal favourite brand, Sony. I haven't used the camera very much but from what I do know, the picture quality seems very good in the day. The size is very convenient, it is almost the size of a digital camera; therefore, it is less hectic to carry around. 

The only problem I think I would have with the camera is that the light is not very useful, as it does not help much in a dark area. Shooting video with the light on in a dark place does no justice, as the picture still comes out dark and not very visible.

Other than that, I think that would be my only objective.

The camera is a very nice camera and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to easily capture life's memorable moments.

In my opinion the camera is:

Convenient; 
Stylish;
Functional; and
User friendly.

I really liked the construction and solid feel of this hub. The inclusion of the mounting bracket and screws was a welcome addition rather then having the hub loose and shifting all over a desk. 

The only major dislike I had and that cost this product a 5-star review was the unnecessary and completely annoying addition of a super-bright blue LED. I'm not sure why companies insist on using these instead of a simple low brightness red LED, but this thing lights up my entire office at night and immediately needed to be covered by black electrical tape.

Sonicare toothbrushes are great.  And buying replacement heads from Amazon keeps the price down a little, plus convenience.  My hygenist gets frustrated when she cleans my teeth because they are already so clean.  And she comments on the health of my gums.  Plus the brush action won't wear away sensitive teeth at the receding gum line (if you have that problem.)  My teeth have been around for a long time.

I bought a sonicare for my son.  After years of bad reports about his poor brushing habits, he now gets good reports.  

I wouldn't want to go back to a regular toothbrush.  And being able to buy replacement heads at Amazon makes the whole business easier.

I have been in the market for a new headset for what seems like forever, and finally committed to buying these, since I specifically wanted a "gaming-grade" headset. I went for the USB version because I have dedicated headphones I use for music (I'm a bit of an audiophile) and I didn't want to constantly reach behind my computer to switch the input/output ports. Since my desktop has front-loading USB, I can easily just plug it in and I'm ready to go.

I play World of Warcraft and very recently, Left 4 Dead and use voice chat over 90% of the game in both games. My previous solution was separate headphones/microphone. I could never fully wear my headphones and talk at the same time though, because I could never hear myself talk--which resulted in me basically yelling without even knowing it. 

When I first picked these headphones up, the first thing I noticed was how light (and unfortunately, cheap) they felt. I can definitely see myself breaking these if I were to just throw them in a bag for example. I would not recommend these for people who do a lot of mobile gaming.

The pro to them being light is that you can wear them for long periods of time and not be bothered. The felt surrounding the ear is incredibly soft. My ears don't heat up or feel bothered by wearing these for a while. 

I plugged in the headphones and they were instantly ready to go, using Windows Vista x64. The sound quality (I have a Creative X-Fi card) is actually pretty good. It's obviously nothing like my professional headphones, but it's great in games and very crisp. I can finally chat with my teammates and hear all the action, without sacrificing one or the other like I had to before. 

Note: If you find you're having odd sound troubles, make sure you visit Creative's website, because there is a firmware upgrade for this headphones that supposedly fix issues some people are having. I personally did not have any problem, but I've read a lot of reviews complaining about the product not working at all.

So overall, if you're in the market for a headset designed for gamers without compromising sound quality, I'd recommend these for sure. The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is the light plastic feel of it...I am very careful in handling it, because I'm afraid it might break!

First the heating is the best, from warm to over 400+ it heats not only quickly but more important safely! Take a close look on 'more pictures' see the 3 stage system the element is welded to the bottom of the pot the temp guide slides in and the electric cord is breakaway using hook and magnet, no way has the pot fallen or slid off the table with the 2 clutzes that live with me.  We started a family Fondue friday and have tried it ALL. Chocolate, Mex cheese, broth boil, and fry. Candles only do chocolate and cheese, sterno if not careful burns the chocolate and only hot enough to fry for 30 min. maybe.  Think out side the description and put soup in it for the buffet table, or baked beans.  The cord is short but a heavy duty extension solved that and the safty features resolves worry. Best for 3 to 6 adults. Our favorite is doing a sweet &amp; sour combo of shrimp, scallops, pork, chicken, beef, everybody got to dip and fry their favorites while picking out their steamed veggies sauces and type of rice.

You can pay $40 and get a tinny sheet metal toaster box that is built just the way they've been building them for the last 30 years (but not built as well) or you can spend a bit more and buy this jewel of an appliance. 

It's put our toaster completely out of business, and it's taken a lot of the load off our regular oven when it comes time for dinner.  Not only that, but a lot of that stuff you want to cook fast in a microwave also gets cooked up fast in this thing (not quite as fast) but not soggy either.  

A really powerful combination is to defrost in your microwave and then cook in this thing.  Perfect corndogs!  And without powering up the power hungry 5000 watt kitchen oven. 

This is the first genuinly perfect toaster solution I've ever had in my life.  Perfect waffles, hot sandwiches, fish sticks, chicken nuggets, french fries, etc.

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)

      



What a movie! This is ever so much the sterling sequel that "Batman Begins" deserved on every conceivable level.

I won't bother delving into the plot, as so many before me have already adequately managed. What I will do, however, is warn you all away from that vile waste of money we've all come to know as the "2-Disc Special Edition." The "special" features on that release are skimpy, to say nothing of underwhelming and, unless you get off on downloading digital copies of films to your laptop or I-Pod, the second disc enabling you to do that will more or less serve as nothing more suitable than a coaster for your beer mug. I steered clear of that well ahead in advance and am now quite content with my single-disc copy of the film. For all that it, too, may lack in the behind-the-scenes department, it still boasts a pristine picture and the sound quality, depending on your personal home theater capability, is second to none. You shouldn't be disappointed.  

Now, having said all this, there have been quite the number of, shall we say, "interesting" negative reviews for "The Dark Knight" popping up within recent weeks here. Some people, these days, just plain and simply do not go to movies like this for the same reasons they did when they were younger. I've been noticing that attitude develop more and more with varying types of film over the years. Movies that are made to entertain and bedazzle their audience with fantastical situations and over-the-top excitement are, instead, unmercifully picked apart and deconstructed by viewers who require that each and every aspect of their entertainment be grounded in unshakeable reality. Put another way, they either cannot or absolutely refuse to separate reality from make-believe. That, I have always maintained, takes so much away from the movie experience. Take, for instance, the word "quality." Many seem to feel that is something sorely missing from a greater majority of today's motion pictures. Well, to that, I'd like to quote an old and clearly forgotten adage: Quality is in the eye of the beholder.

Case in point:

I have met many throughout my life who grew up watching Adam West as Batman. They, along with the extremely select few who embraced the two trainwrecks Joel Schumacher gave us in "Batman Forever" and "Batman & Robin," truly believe this candy-coated portrayal of the caped crusader is an accurate representation of who Batman is and forever should be. These are some of the same individuals who have probably never read Grant Morrison's "Arkham Asylum," the unapologetic and altogether dark graphic novel he published through DC nearly twenty years ago. They are also undoubtedly the very same viewers who are now referring to "The Dark Knight" as "over-rated" and "poorly-made garbage," foolishly declaring to the entire free world that anyone who claims otherwise is not a "true" fan of Bob Kane's brainchild. Pardon me, but that's just petty. I think Christopher Nolan made it perfectly clear, in no uncertain terms to everybody from Day One, that this movie would not cater to the traditional cartoon comic-book image old-school Adam West and Cesar Romero purists were used to. This is the brooding Dark Knight more recent fans have spotted in the Morrison work I mentioned above, as well as in other graphic novels such as "Batman: Year One."

You should be made aware of the film's 154 minute running time, especially if you don't happen to enjoy sitting through long movies. Those two hours and thirty four minutes place it within the impressive company of Richard Donner's equally long "Superman," James Cameron's cut of "Aliens," and Bryan Singer's more recent "Superman Returns." And, just like all three of those classics, this one is every bit the worthy purchase. Do not, by any means, miss it!

I bought this router for two reasons: I had upgraded my cable internet service, but was not getting anywhere near the promised speed; and my son wanted wireless internet connectivity to his Nintendo Wii and DS.  A call to Nintendo confirmed that this was one of the routers that would work well with their game systems.

As an old computer techie, I was not happy with the setup software that comes with this router.  I ignored it and just connected to the router directly (adress: 192.168.1.1; username: admin; password: password.)  I set the WEP security key in the Wireless Security section, changed the password, and I was ready to go.  My son had no trouble connecting his games wirelessly, and my computers (that are connected to the computer via Ethernet cables) were getting 30mbps throughput - six times faster than my previous router, which was five years old.  This is definitely a five star router for those whose needs are similar to mine: wired computer connections, and wireless games - with some computer skills.  If you want fast WIRELESS computer acess, might want to consider a faster "N" router, and if you're computer illiterate, you might want a router with easier setup instructions.

I take a star off because I wished it looked and felt more sturdier, the plastic casing seems little cheap to me, but not a big issue as it is primarily intended for indoor usage with minimal movement.

this is a good keyboard with few issues. I like the illumination effects and the "feel" of typing. Ive had this for about 2 months and i have had no issues. Being a student, i write alot of papers and I have never typed on a keyboard so successfully. I also use this for gaming. Once again the "feel" is really good. Overall this is a really good product for a good price.

I have had this modem now for a couple of years and it still works great.  We have a three-story home and the wireless modem is located on the second floor.  It never drops signal on any floor and the unit is not so large.  Also, it is a great value because you don't have to by a router, it has the modem and router all in one!  Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to buy a modem and router and not sign a contract with the Internet/phone company!

As soon as I plugged in the firewire to my G4 Power Mac it placed the icon on the desktop and started the backup.  Has worked like a charm ever since.  Great buy, great product.  Feel very safe now with the hourly backups. Absolutely no problems.  Recommended highly.

I love the Ipod Touch. I couldn't live without it now. I thought it was a little pricey when I bought it but it does so much that I found out why it's so pricey and it's well worth the money. There were only a few things I don't like. The fact that it doesn't tell you much about what comes on it when you buy it and in my opinion it really should come with some kind of game on it even if it's a free one. The instructions really don't tell you how to do a lot of things and so I had to do a lot of searching on the internet for answers. Also if you plan on using it to view movies or videos on your TV be warned that you can't just buy the cheapest A/V cable there is. I went through 3 or 4 before I finally got it to work. And if you plan on buying a dock for it and using it to connect to your TV, you can only use the Apple A/V cables because of the chip in the cable. You can hear sound with any cables but you have to have Apple's to get the video to work. In my opinion, I would think they make enough money off of you when you buy it and you really should be able to buy cheaper things for it. The games and applications are pretty reasonably priced. There are some really good free games and apps and others that start at .99 cents and go up to 9.99 or more. So if you are looking for a an awesome MP3 player to listen to music on and that you can play games on and make grocery list and keep track of just about anything you can think of, and do it just by touching the screen, then you will love this product. I know I do.

"Sometimes I think sitting on trains 
Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game 
Everyone's a winner, we're making our fame 
Bonafide hustler making my name" 
(M.I.A. "Paper Planes") 

And so it goes - the backdrop of a Mumbai slum and a popular game show, mixed with a love story, a drama, the exotic melodies of A. R. Rahman and the unmistakable voice of M.I.A. 

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS) 

1. Boy from the slums grows up the hard way 
2. He learns from his unforgettable experiences 
3. Boy meets girl 
4. Boy loses girl 
5. Boy finds girl 
6. Boy loses girl again 
7. Boy finds girl 
8. You guessed it! 
9. Boy risks all to find girl again 
10. He doesn't take "no" for a final answer 

This storyline sounds simple, but it's told as a series of flashbacks that will touch your every emotion. When a former street hustler turned tea boy (Dev Patel) inexplicably makes it up the ladder of the Indian version of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" the suspicious host (Anil Kapoor) calls in the police, who proceed to extract the truth out of him in their own inimitable and sometimes shocking fashion. 

His sad story is revealed piece by piece, with an explanation of how he knew the answers to all the questions leading up to the big one, and the 20 million rupees. 
We learn however, that he's really after a much better prize. 

Poverty, violence, religious intolerance, child abuse, betrayal and revenge are tempered somewhat by love, faith, hope, suspense, humor and music, and this exceedingly clever and well directed drama will have you laughing, crying, squirming and sometimes make you downright outraged. 

This is one you MUST see, and then buy so you can see it again. Great movie, great casting, great music, great sets, great story - too many "greats" to state here. 

This isn't one you should miss.

My Windows XP desktop has really been showing its age lately, and as a college student I've been increasingly frustrated by not having a laptop. The computer labs at school are always packed, and professors are increasingly assigning online activities and posting lecture notes online -- all of which it is very helpful to be able to access during class, without having to print out a ton of materials from the web at home. Besides school, I also planned to migrate all my photo processing and video editing tasks over from the XP machine to this one.

I have generally had to reinstall Windows XP on a fairly regular basis to keep my desktop running like new, and I'd been hearing a lot of things about how macs don't have a lot of the problems associated with windows. Ultimately, I decided to definitely go mac after trying Vista on a few different PC's and hating it. 

I started doing my research. The new macbook pros had recently come out (the ones with the "unibody"), but after reading myriad complaints about the super-glossy screen just being obnoxious, I hastily bought this previous generation of Macbook pro with the matte screen option. If you look at it, the specs are nearly the same. OK, the RAM speed is 667 instead of 1066. The video card was the previous model from nvidia, although with 512 mb of dedicated RAM. To get comparable specs in the latest generation, you'd have to pay a LOT more (over half of a thousand dollars, *since amazon is so good at censoring dollar figures*)

Anyway, I've been using my mac for about two weeks now, and here are my thoughts:

This machine runs great. It's fast. I really like OS X so far. The touchpad is great, and HUGE compared to others I've seen. AND it still has a button, which I prefer to the new MB pro's giant buttonless pad. Scrolling with two fingers is SO much better than a mouse wheel or clicking the scroll on-screen.  I purchased 4 gigs of RAM to upgrade this (it comes with 2). It's a cheap upgrade, and I definitely noticed a difference right away. I'd recommend it. Someday I plan on upgrading the hard drive to a 500gb 7200rpm -- again, not much money for a huge upgrade. The factory drive is just fine for now though. 

Anyway, there was one little problem. After using the machine for a couple of days, I noticed a dead pixel on the screen! It's about a quarter of the way from the left side, in the middle of the screen. I really had to think about sending the unit back for another one. If I hadn't already installed a whole bunch of software and pretty much "moved in", I probably would have exchanged it. I read about the problem online, and it's not uncommon. Apple doesn't even consider it a warranty issue unless there are 5 or more bad pixels. I thought about it, and after using the machine for a couple more days, I realized that in practice I simply did not notice the dead pixel. I generally only see it if I look for it -- and unless the screen is all white, it's pretty much invisible the rest of the time. I decided just to keep the unit, and the pixel really hasn't bugged me since, although I subtracted a star because for the price, I really feel the screen ought to be flawless. 

Anyway, at the end of the day this is a fine machine -- I'd highly recommend it -- especially if you think the high gloss screen of the new model will be a problem, or if you are faced with having to get a Vista machine. I'd definitely recommend OS X over Vista or XP. Hope that helps!!

PS, I've noticed that the price on these has gone up appreciably. If you think you want the older model, you might be running out of time! All glossy screen haters are gonna be snatching 'em up!

I bought this gate not long after my first child was born.  He's now 3 and I haven't had a need for it.  Now we are expecting our second child and I intend to use this gate again and possibly purchase another one because we are in a different house.  The only problem is that I lost one of the "feet" that pushes against the wall but I think I can just order that part from the company.  I even used this gate at the top of the stairs.  I was a little skeptical at first but it held up and worked great.  I may need several more now because we have a 2-story house as well as a basement.  But all in all love that my child could never push hard enough to open the gate or climb over it.  It's very sturdy and doesn't look like one of those cheap wood or plastic ones.  I love it and would highly recommend it to other parents!

Replaced an older Ethernet only (4 port) router with this Wireless/Ethernet router.  I use this router, it's 4 Ethernet connections and a switching box, to run 3 LAN/Ethernet wired PC's, a LAN printer, , and use the wireless feature for a MAC laptop.  
This router is fast and I have not experienced any dropouts since installing it 3 weeks ago.  Wireless range and signal strength are very good.
Installation instructions were well written and the process went easy.  I mounted the box vertically and instructions clearly show various antenna positions for vertical mounting. 
I had a minor problem figuring out where in the DLink site to activate Wireless Security. I called DLink Technical Support, was connected right away and received clear instructions. 
Very satisfied with my purchase.

I'll leave the technical details to the technical folks.  What I will say about this video camera is it's easy to understand and use and it's small enough to fit in a shirt or jacket pocket.  

We recently took the FLIP out for a spin on our vacation and were surprised at how well it performed.  The FLIP works great with our PC laptop, reasonably well with my Mac desktop, and is easy enough that everyone we showed it to could work it in less than a minute--that includes both kids and technophobic adults.  

For the price, the FLIP's a great way to store memories without having to carry around a lot of expensive and bulky gear. We actually have three friends buying FLIPS because they liked ours so much.

The Braun 5270 Epilator does a great job at doing what it's supposed to, pulling hairs!

For everyone that complains that it hurts, well what do you expect?  Honestly?

It's tweezing the hairs out of your skin many at a time...is this supposed to feel good?

I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it.  At first she said it hurt, but then she took it like a champ and didn't stop until she had done both of her legs.  I tried it on my chest and yes it stings a little at first, but unless you have no tolerance for pain you'll get used to it pretty quickly...and bottom line, it does its job quite well.

Pros:

Pulls the hairs out by the root so you have smoother skin for a longer period of time versus shaving.

Less messy than waxing.

Better than shaving because your hairs won't grow back as thick, which may happen if you shave often.

The white LED light on it helps you see those stray hairs.

Gets your skin silky smooth.

Comes with the shaver head and small cleaning brush, which comes in handy.

Cons:

It's slightly loud, but not enough to really drive you crazy.  Sounds maybe a little louder than an electric razor.

It stings...but that's to be expected...suck it up if you want the results.

Sometimes it can pinch the skin...you have to watch how hard you press it against your skin, and be careful if using it on areas such as your toes, it can pinch enough to scrape off the top layer (I found this out the hard way).

It can't be used cordless, and many say the cord is too short...for some people they may need to use an extension cord if they try to use it in a bathroom without a nearby outlet.

Sometimes you'll have to go over the same area multiple times and it may miss some hairs, but for the most part it gets the majority...it's not perfect, but 9.5 out of 10 for effectiveness.


Bottom Line: If you want the results of tweezed-smooth skin, get this product.  It does what it's supposed to.  And for those people who buy this and then complain that it hurts...don't come writing bad reviews about it just because of that...you knew that going in!

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Video On Demand)

      



I took my kids to see this when it came out in theatre.  Not just because it was Heath Ledger's last movie, or because it was another Batman movie, but because it was the sequel to an equally great movie, Batman Begins.  After I sat and watched the first one with my kids one night at home, I couldn't wait for the sequel to come out.  It followed so masterfully from the first movie into the second one and Dark Knight ended with what you know will be another 1st class sequel.

Christian Bale is probably now my favorite Batman character of all of the previous ones.  I've seen him in several other movies and have become a big fan anyways, but he really does a great job in these two movies.

Enough has been said about Heath and what this movie did to him, but I loved him long before Dark Knight.  I fell in love with him in The Patriot, alongside Mel Gibson, and laughed at his silly and courageous antics in A Knights Tale.  And no matter what was thought or said about the content of the movie, I absolutely adored him in Brokeback Mountain.  It was directed well, superbly acted, and truly showed a friendship between two men.  Heath Ledger was a wonderful person, great actor, and I will dearly miss seeing him on the big screen.

The remaining actors they chose for the first one and this sequel were excellent choices: Michael Caine, Eric Roberts, Gary Oldman, and of course Maggie Gylenhall, only to name a few of my faves.  Maggie replaced her predecessor very well in this flick and honestly, I liked her portrayal of Rachael better.

Probably the other thing I agree with on other reviews is don't waste your money on the 2-Disc version.  My son bought this, so it was what he wanted.  I was happy watching the movie and the quality is excellent, but the 2nd disc didn't have much more than I could have found online.

If you ever want to find out how Disney tried to bridge the gap between their classic animated fantasies and the live action spectaculars of today, DARBY O'GILL AND THE LITTLE PEOPLE is a typical example of the way things shaped up in 1959.  Very few of Disney's movies were specifically about the Irish people, and it is noteworthy that, even in the day of MULAN and POCAHONTAS, no animated feature has been released by Disney that concentrates on an Irish story!  So this is where you would go if you wanted to look at Irish legend told through Disney's famous factory of observation and fun.

Of course for those who like looking at "stars before they were stars" the movie reveals a Sean Connery whom some will not recognize because he's just so darn young!  Connery had filmed a few movies earlier in the UK, and I suppose Disney executives thought that if his name was "Sean," he might be Irish as John Ford (who sometimes said his name was "Sean") and cast him as an Irish woodsman with a huge crush on Janet Munro.  Well, both Munro and Connery and Scottish but it didn't seem to make a difference to the youth of America at which this picture was aimed.  The DVD transfer is stunning and filled with the creamy, crisp photography typical of Disney product at the time.

It's no QUIET MAN but it has its moments; and it's scary for kids, so turn out all the lights and let the little ones in, one by one.

I picked up this camera to carry around with me and pick up some spontaneous interviews for a film I am making. Works great for interviews as long as there is enough light - otherwise the picture is noisy (grainy).  I found that I need to bring up the lows some on the audio - but that is personal taste - you may find the audio quite acceptable as recorded. 

My only negative is the playback quality of "moving" images (I know, that's why we are using a camcorder and not a still camera!).  It doesn't look like typical 29.97 FPS (30 frames per second) but has the appeareance of perhaps 18 FPS or so (It could be doing some  sort of upconverting from a lower FPS rate - but I really don't know). But the actual picture quality is very good.  In fact, still pictures from the video are very acceptable for websites or most computer uses.

The USB connection is very convenient and the loaded software works great. I shot some video for a friend the other day and quickly transferred the video and FlipShare software onto his computer so he could view and upload the video to YouTube.  Very easy to use.

I would have given the camera 5 stars except for the playback of fast motion.  I did email customer support about the issue and though they were very quick to respond to my inquiry, the response was a bit rude and unnecessary.  But they did get back to me.

Unless you are looking for a camera with longer record capability or longer zoom, this is a great camera for most uses.  Enjoy it!

I've been using varations on this manufacturer's products for years.  It's been my experience that it's a good substitute for a Rimadyl Rx until my dogs inevitably get so bad that I have to use both the Synovi product and a half dose of Rimadyl, - eventually going to a full dose of Rimadyl. I average about 2 years on this product before I have to start including Rimadyl. Were it not for this product, I had a greyhound that I would have had to put to sleep at 9 years old because he could barely stand up without screaming in pain.  With Synovi and Rimadyl, he lasted until 13.5 years old before I had to put him to finally sleep.  He appeared to be comfortable right up until the end when all the joints in his back leg fused and he simply could no longer lift himself up.
My veterinarian says it takes a couple of weeks to see the results of using this product, but I have seen dramatic results in just a few days.
You can generally get this product a lot cheaper thru Amazon.  The vets generally carry this stuff, but have a much larger mark up.

Not just for the Mac Mini

I originally purchased one of these as a companion to a Mac Mini.  But it has been such a spacious and reliable drive that I have purchased more for different machines including my Windows laptop.  And the built in USB hub is a nice touch.  It is so convenient I don't know why it is not a standard feature of all external hard drives.  I highly recommend for use with PCs or Macs.

If you do use it with a Mac Mini, I have a recommendation.  Somewhere in the documentation I read where it suggested to stack the MiniMax under the Mac Mini.  While it does fit and stacks nicely, it gets way to hot.  I would recommend putting them side by side.

We now have two of these.  Although the dish is large, our two cats are real "foodies" and it made them very competative when they had to eat from the same dish.  And the best part is they haven't figured a way to chew through the top (although they have tried a bit - these cats think nothing of chewing through cat food bags, or the corner off of a milk carten.)  One found if he fiddled at the opening enough with his paw he could get the "crunchies" to drop out one by one, but we taped a piece of card board over the front just enough to deter him.  We had no problem setting the timer.  It does seem to dispense a bit more food than the setting suggests so we down sized the portion.  We have left cats for three days easily and probably will for longer with someone coming in to check and do litter box duty.

This is from one who didn't like the books. I read the first one and was so mad, I couldn't read any more. Here's why. I lived all over Louisiana. No one in the area the book is taking place talks Cajun. Are there any Cajuns in the Shreveport area? I currently am living in the southern region and I have to hunt hard to find one with an accent. 

Also, the northwestern part of the state doesn't have any swamp areas. I would have forgiven a Yankee, but this writer lives in the south! I just couldn't keep reading the books. 

I wasn't planning on seeing the HBO series either until a few friends told me I was missing a treat. The only reason I tuned in was to tell them I did watch it and like the books, I don't care for it. Now I am addicted. I've watched the first six episodes. It's like a dang soap opera vampire series. OMG! It's Dark Shadows all over again! I was hooked on those too.

The only gripes I have are minor. Tara's southern accent and Rene's Cajun one are like nails on a chalkboard. I love Sookie, but she needs to tone down her accent as well. LOVE Bill and Sam. Nelsan Ellis who plays Lafayette Reynolds is my absolute favorite character.

I have spent the last couple hours playing with the new Slingbox Solo. In comparison to the Slingbox pro I like this new model better. It is about 1/2 the size and does not need an extra dongle for HD video.

The software to setup the device is very easy and very fast. Video quality on a home network is superb. Internet is not bad but depends on how much upstream bandwidth you have available.

The only gripe I have with it is the unit does not come with any component cables. This however is a small gripe.

Overall this device is well worth the money if you like watching TV. 

Hopefully slingmedia will come out with an iPhone client soon.

I don't have alot to write (who has the time), but I will defend and say simply that season 7 was one of the best seasons for Smallville.  I was excited to see every episode and could not wait for the next episode each week.  Granted it's not a perfect show, but I really love it even after all these years and will be sad for this is it's final season.

I recently purchased a laptop with Windows Vista.  I wanted a secure flash drive with lots of disk space.  I decided to buy the SanDisk 4GB drive based on the customer reviews.  I must say I am completely satisfied with the product.

U3 is a new feature for flash drives.  It comes pre-installed and acts like a separate operating system.  It allows you to install programs on the drive which you can use on any machine.

U3 Pros

- Programs like Firefox and Trillian can be used on machines with strict administrative rules.
- Great programs are available free from SanDisk and are super easy to install
- Bright Blue Light on the thumb button turns on when you insert the drive and off when it's safe to remove the drive.

U3 Cons

- You can't install your own software
- U3 takes two drive letters, one for data and the other is a simulated cd-rom drive.

Also, this drive is ReadyBoost compatible.  Anyone looking to use that feature on Vista should purchase this flash drive.

I've tried a lot of energy bars. i use them while I'm camping and as high-protein snacks when I am watching my weight. These Builder Bars are the BEST! They are hefty in weight - you get your money's worth. They are chocolaty and candy-like, though they are high in protein. They are a perfect meal substitute if you are hiking, camping, fishing, or somewhere that you can't stop to make a meal. I have these on subscription order - they come every month and we eat them all. This is an incredible price, too.

I bought this for my husband who is a true ice cream addict and we all love the ice cream that this machine makes.  We followed the directions and recipe included in the box for basic ice cream and 25 minutes later we had delicious, rich, creamy vanilla ice cream. Next time we got a little crazy and put some cookie dough in the mix and that was even better....many different versions of frozen desserts can be very easily made.  This machine is easy to use, price was right, good stuff. And as usual, Amazon always delivers.

For years I used Linksys WRT300N with a dozen wireless computers at some time or another,  and recently with Apple iTouch and ASUS AIGURU_SV1 stand alone SKYPE video phone.  All connected and stayed connected as needed, never dropping network connection.

Recently problem occured with use of Hewlett-Packard Mini 1000 netbook  that was frequently dropping wireless network connection.  I replaced the old router with the new WRT610N, and the HP Mini 100 works OK, not dropping network any more.  

It is clear that the new router has much longer range than the older model, even on the 2.4 GHz band. Simplicity of setup is amazing.  Array of LED color coded lights explain status of everything, including the security protection activation.

This keyboard is awesome...the keys are very sturdy, but not TOO sturdy, meaning you don't need to use a lot of extra pressure to type anything; its not too flimsy either so your hands feel very used to the qwerty pad. It doesnt make a lot of noise either, in case you're worried about bothering that easily irritable someone 3 feet away from you. Of course, the lights are the biggest selling point for this item, and of course, the lights are brilliant. I mean, its not a necessity for a keyboard, not even if you use it in the dark (by now I think most people don't need to look at the keys to use a keyboard) but its a very nice little added aesthetic value to the keyboard. The lights do work, don't get me wrong, but I'd still be completely satisfied without the lights.

I can put everything in one word- Amazing.
  At costco, you can get one with 100 GB (I believe, can't remember clearly now) around the same price. The six celled battery is just amazing, it has more battery than my friend's 1500 dollar laptop. Simple games like Maplestory and WoW works fine. But you might have some problem if you're a hardcore gamer that plays games that has great amount of requirement, I suggest you do not get this netbook. Other than that, everything is fine, this little beast could do things that you would never imagine possible. Great for traveling and browsing the net. The keyboard is also good, it doesn't feel cheap like most of the other laptops( I'm typing this review on it right now). I think that this laptop is worth every penny that I paid.
Again, Amazing.

I had been thinking of picking up a laptop after Vista's next service pack comes out this spring, but read about this little unit and decided it was time to get a machine using open source software.  There is not a stitch of Microsoft gumware on it.  What a delight to be on-line on my wireless network in about 15 seconds after turning it on.  I was surprised by how well I can read the 7" screen.  The small internal flash memory in lieu of a hard drive is not a problem for me, as I use a portable flash memory stick to store and transport files.  The only drawback might be the tiny keyboard.  I am not a touch typist but do pretty well in general; I do find myself making more mistakes with this keyboard.  All in all, I think Asus has managed to cram an incredible value into this inexpensive, little bitty box.

For $90 delivered (plus $25 worth of free stuff if you can get your total over $125 and get $25 off), this machine blows anything else away.  

Mine came this week, and I would say that the issue w/the filter holder having to be twisted past the "lock" mark is correct.  Big deal!  So the espresso doesn't come out exactly parallel to the base.  The bottom line: this unit makes great espresso.

My last machine was a $1,000 Saeco superautomatic type machine.  This one makes esperesso just as good, or even better, than that.

Get a decent burr grinder and you're set.  The machine is high quality, sturdy, looks great, and most importantly, makes great espresso.

One tip - run about 5 seconds of hot water through the machine before you put the coffee in the filter holder.  This will ensure that your espresso is hot as opposed to luke-warm.

Another tip - after you put the filter holder on the machine w/the coffee grounds, turn the water on for about 5 seconds to "pre-wet" the espresso.  Then run the regular shot.

The trimmer works very well. It is smoother and more powerful than I actually expected. I found the attachment combs to be quite useful too, although it takes a few minutes to get the hang of how to use them most effectively. They are a little flimsy, so be careful when pulling them off. Cleaning the device is very easy, and is really just another example of the simplicity of the trimmer.The battery and recharging time needs particular attention though, and can be quite an inconvenience, which is pretty much the only reason this doesn't get 5 stars. If they release a slightly more expensive updated version with a battery that doesn't overcharge/overheat and die out, then I'll be upgrading to that. Overall, a very nifty trimmer.

We have a 5 month old boy and have used both the Luvs size two and Luvs size three. We have been very pleased with both absorption and price. These diapers seem thin, but are durable enough to last overnight with no leaks and you get the most diapers for the least amount of money. They usually arrive within a week to 10 days, so we don't have to sacrifice convenience either. We will continue to use Luvs and Amazon.com.

I already have one of these and they are fantastic with tons of storage for videos, pics. . . .  Also, I paid alot more than $0.01 for my original drive.  That being said. . . 

Yesterday I wrote:
I ordered 2 of these to give as gifts @ $0.01 each + shipping only to find out, like others, that it would not be honored by either Digital Media Source nor Amazon. It's a shame that there has been only a quick one-sentence email from Amazon playing big brother and sticking up for Digital Media Source saying order was cancelled. The price was jumping around all day - I thought it was some cool Black Friday promotion but instead it was only a farce. Thanks for helping me miss out on other Black Friday flash drive deals but hey - at least you got a bunch of extra webpage hits from your deceit.

Today, following the supposed apology/explanation/blame from Gene at Digital Media Source, I write:
Gene, President of Digital Media Source, I apologize for being such a nimrod to actually try and purchase this item at $0.01 because, according to you "Obvously any rational buyer would realize a price of .01 on a $35 item must be some sort of mistake."  Forgive me for thinking there was a deal to be had on, of all days, Black Friday.  I am so utterly stupid to think that a company might be selling an item at a ridiculously enticing price.  It would be asinine for a company try to increase hits to their website by offering an out-of-control deal on an item.  Accept my apology for obviously (yes, you did spell obviously wrong in your formal business semi-apology/blame-Amazon letter) not being a rational buyer (also, please forgive the other 1749 buyers)! I mean Ebay is selling Corvettes, digital cameras, golf club sets, plasma tvs... for $1 with FREE SHIPPING - $1 must be the fair-market value of those items because, according to you, selling something for less than it costs to buy would be unheard of, right?!?!?!?!?

Sorry for all of this - I hate the blame game.  Someone needs to step-up and apologize and say "It was my fault" and not blame others and then blame the customer for being stupid enough to try and buy an item at an unbelievable price.
If it is Amazon's fault then we'll await their statement but if it's Gene's fault then stop blaming Amazon and the customer.
Oh, and one more thing:  Tools--> Spelling and Grammar.  It works wonders!

After 5 1/2 seasons, The Office is as strong as ever. The writing is still there and every episode is more addicting than the last. Same great characters with their flaws and all. People you hate you end up feeling bad for-it's madness all around! I can't compare the individual seasons because to me, it's like one gigantic show. There is no bad season, there is no mediocre season.

 I have given every single season five stars and I didn't even have second thoughts as I did it. I only recently started watching the series and I INSTANTLY fell in love. I scrambled to watch every single episode to catch up to season 5. And I didn't feel that a minute of my time was wasted. I can't really say that about any other show that I've watched, except LOST. 

I hope this show stays around a long, long time.

First, excellent DVD Deluxe Edition. Second, I would like to respond to the &quot;viewer from San Jose&quot; who posted on 10/20/99. Movies made before 1953 were filmed in an aspect ratio of 1.33:1. Television has an  aspect ratio of 1.37:1. When you view a movie such as THE WIZARD OF OZ in a  full screen transfer you are losing a mere .04:1 of the original aspect  ratio.

The Good Things
*Smashing special effects and action scenes.
*Good, straightforward filming style.  A few scenes in the beginning had me worried, because they had some weird jumping camera effects, but most of the movie's style is slick and smooth.
*Very good, sleek production designs and costumes.
*Pretty good, straightforward story.  Contains a good mix of action, comedy, drama, and a smidgeon of romance.
*Good themes and imagery reflecting modern-day conflicts in the world, and the role major business play in it (a little similar to "Lord of War", but not as serious).
*Pretty good characters; pretty good acting.  In fact, the main character is better developed than I thought he would be.  Much of the story revolves around his evolution from a cold-hearted entrepeneur into an empathetic hero.
*Look out for Stan Lee's cameo, once again!
*Great sound effects.
*Awesome music.

The Bad Things
*One or two slow parts.  The really cool stuff doesn't happen until at least 30 minutes into it.  But it's still not too dull at all.

Once you get into it, this is quite an exciting and slick superhero movie.  Much of the action and effects are quite memorable.  The characters are not too shabby.  The story has enough of everything to keep it engaging, even when there's nothing happening.  Moreover, it has some subtle elements reflecting modern-day issues (with terrorism and arms dealing), I would say that it is better.  It's still not extremely deep or profound, but is quite enjoyable, and would rank it as being better than "The Fantastic Four."

This is my third Braun shaver, having just recently upgraded from a Braun Synchro (which also has the automatic cleaning function).  The pulsonic gives a slightly better shave and has some neat features, but is no miracle shaver.  I am happy with it, but wouldn't have spent $200 to upgrade if I knew what I know now.  Instead, I would either have kept my Synchro or tried the 360 which has many of the same features as the Pulsonic (but no ultra-sonic pulses -- see the lawsuit as to whether this is worth anything).

If you are switching from a blade, you will definitely not get as close a shave.  If you are switching from another Braun, you will probably get a better shave, but probably not $200 better.

Pros:  A closer shave; cleaning base works very well; ability to wash the shaver head with plain water when necessary.  The cleaning base is nice but I recommend only cleaning every few days to preserve the fluid.  The new blade design (also a feature of the 360) does a better job of slicing the hair vice chopping it and causes less irritation than my synchro did.
Cons:  Only marginally better than my synchro and probably not much better than the 360.  Shaver head and cutter block are all one piece and have to be replcaed all at once (about $40).  Finally, price.  A nice looking shaver but it just doesn't provide a $200 shave.

Overall, a good shaver.  If I didn't know the pricetag, I would be very happy with it.

This little coffee maker is perfect for anyone who is single and lives alone. I hated the big coffee makers that made me waste coffee by brewing a whole pot for at least 4-6 cups. I resorted to getting instant coffee which is alot more expensive and doesnt taste half as good as freshly brewed.
It makes a great single cup of coffee,just as good as any expensive coffee maker out there, with absolutely no waste.
The silver mug is stylish and convienent and the fact that you dont need to run out and buy filters becouse it has a built in one is an added plus.
I do use the #1 filters (very inexpensive-99 cents for a pack of 40) only becouse it saves a tiny bit of time for cleanup...but there really is no need for them.
I love this coffee maker..its perfect!

This series is AMAZING. Just to let you know how amazing, I've used capital letters - and I loathe people who use capitals like that. It's possibly the very best sci-fi I've ever seen, and I'm taking Firefly into account on that too. (Firefly is funnier. This isn't really funny.) 

Basically, you've got this civilization of people on these planets, and they're the descendants of the people from the original Batlestar Galactica ships. And the Cylons attack again - because, as they say, for children to come into their own, first the parents must die -  so you have whoever was already off-planet, or was able to get off-planet still surviving. And running. And the Cylons are much, much more complex now, both emotionally and physically.

I read THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES by Sue Monk Kidd about two years ago.  I enjoyed the book very much because it nicely evoked a sense of place (the rural south, with its humidity, ramshackle houses, lush flora and fauna) and it also created very vivid characters.  It also suffered from a couple of unlikely coincidences and sometimes a bit too much sentimentality.  It didn't trust the power it had built up to successfully tug at our heartstrings and evoke tears without just a little bit of extra obvious manipulation.  I found it brisk, involving reading but a little short of classic status.

The film is almost exactly the same.  While I don't remember tiny details of the book, and thus no doubt there are some "key" scenes missing, the film is very faithful to the plot of the book and its characters.  It captures both the strengths and weaknesses of the book quite well.  Frankly, if you like (or love) the book, then you should be quite content with how it has been translated.  If you are unfamiliar with the book, you should have some of the same reactions to the film as I described about the book above.

The story is set in 1964.  14-year-old Lily Owens (Dakota Fanning) is a mature beyond her years girl in South Carolina.  She carries a heavy burden.  Ten years previously, while watching a fight between her mother and her abusive father, she accidentally fired a gun.  The bullet killed her mother.  Her mother, who was in the process of leaving her father and also, she fears, leaving her.  This has left a hole in Lily, because she's torn between her fantasies of a loving mother that she has killed and a her fears that her mother was about to abandon her to her awful father.  Lily's housekeeper Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson) is somewhat friendly with the smart, inquisitive Lily (a girl who loves to write in her journal) and one day the two are walking somewhat companionably to town.  Lily needs to stop by the store...Rosaleen is on her way to register to vote now that President Johnson has signed the Civil Rights Act.  The redneck bigots in town figure out Rosaleen's intentions, and a confrontation ensures in which Rosaleen insults the men and they, in turn, attack her.

Lily seizes on the opportunity to rescue Rosaleen from the hospital, where she is recovering prior to her imprisonment.  Lily takes Rosaleen to the town of Tiburon, SC...the only clue she has to where her mother might have come from.  With little money and only a vague notion of her approach, the two runaways are taken in by a family of sisters who run a honey harvesting operation.  It is amongst these women that Lily (and Rosaleen) learn some important lessons about life, learn to feel a sense of belonging, and ultimately, perhaps for Lily, learn about the fate of loved ones.  

There are three Boatwright sisters:  August (Queen Latifah) the eldest, who runs the business and dispenses worldly advice and tough love in that way only Queen Latifah can.  There is June (Alicia Keys) the stern music-teacher who has put up a pretty heavy emotional armor.  She's clearly enamored of her boyfriend Neil, a fellow teacher, but refuses to fully release herself to him.  Finally, there is May (Sophie Okonedo), who is the most warm-hearted, kind person you'd care to meet, but she is also tormented by inner demons.  I don't want to give away too much about May, because discovering the truth behind her afflictions is one of the joys of the story.

Suffice it to say that the film takes these characters and first shows how the civil rights movement affects them.  Lily learns firsthand some harsh lessons about hatred.  But it is far, far more interested in showing us how these women (and the men who buzz around them) grow and change...but also how strength takes on many different aspects, and how these different forms of strength can help others with their weaknesses and fears.  

It's a brightly lit movie.  It practically beams...much as Queen Latifah spends so much time beaming.  It's full of metaphors (many dealing with bees, of course)...and sometimes it is just a bit heavy-handed.  August Boatwright is sometimes just a little TOO wise and understanding.  Lily is sometimes just a smidge to precocious.  June is sometimes a little TOO hardened.  And unfortunately, the ending is just a little too pat and convenient.  In "real life," this story would have played out with more mess and more collateral damage.

Yet it's still so nice to see a movie that wants to embrace you with good feelings...realism be damned.  Come enjoy these lively women, it says.  Get swept up in their characters.  That's what the book wanted to do, and that's what the film does.  

This is accomplished mostly by virtue of some really, really nice performances.  Queen Latifah, in many ways, fares the worst, because this is a character that was almost written to be played by her.  We see her doing very little that is new for her...but she's so good at this character that we draw some comfort from the familiarity.  She does have one devastating scene involving another of her sisters that shows she is ready to take another step as an actress.  Alicia Keys looks lovely and gives a focused performance...more than anyone, her character seems to belong squarely in 1964...from her clothes to her attitude.  Jennifer Hudson is fine as Rosaleen...it's no longer a curiosity that this former American Idol can act...she can and should.  Her character somewhat falls by the wayside in the 2nd half of the film...but in our glimpses of her, we still see how she has grown and changed.  Sophie Okonedo, who was so good in HOTEL RWANDA, is fabulous here.  When she is on screen, she just bursts with life and energy and you simply can't take your eyes off of her.  Whether her eyes are sparkling with loving mischief, or glazing over in dismay...she fully invests herself in the work.

Finally, I'm happy to say that Dakota Fanning is still reliably good.  I would say she's going to make the transition from child star to teen star with little effort.  She's the real deal as an actress.  

THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES may not win major awards or become a much-beloved classic...but it IS an outstandingly evocative film that is so well acted.  I'd recommend it for anyone willing to spend time with some really interesting women...AND I'd recommend it to audiences aged 13 and above.  I think that young teen girls, in particular, might take a special liking to the film.

This review is from: Milk [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)

      



This biopic about Harvey Milk, America's first openly gay elected official, and his assassination is hardly cold.   

Realizing he was 'different', Milk successfully faced down a hard-knock life before ultimately settling into and opening up his camera store in San Francisco's Castro district. He even was a military veteran, having served during the U.S. Navy with a honorable discharge unrelated to his sexuality! 

However, having absorbed many of his generation's conservative sexual mores, he too needed liberation. And this is where Sean Penn delivers a powerful performance. Penn shows us the future leader's emotional journey's were fundamentally responsible in shaping his commitment to helping other people. 

Believing that all politics is local was Milk's strongest point. He did not run to make a spectacle of himself or his community; however they actually initially treated his campaigns. Becoming a rallying point after his assasination, he was one of the crowd before winning high office.  

And while Milk did not win his initial campaigns, this film focuses on the election to the San Francisco board of city supervisors and the ultimate aftermath. 

He ran because he was a small business owner who wanted services and policies improved. Important initiatives which were passed under his watch were a civil rights bill for homosexuals and a 'pooper scooper' law requiring pet owners to pick up after their animals. 

Were he alive today, I'd imagine that Harvey would be pleased by the 2008 voter turnout, but concerned by the still lagging participation in local elections and activities.

The movie takes some liberties with Milk's life and events, but is overall an accurate and empathetic depiction. In an era when it's so easy to complain about the condition of things, we can't help but admire a public figure who went out and actually attempted to make the world a better place.

This this is great for workouts.  Clips onto a hat or your shirt and won't bother you at all.  Really nice.

Easy to work with both PC or Mac.  Just plug it in, load up iTunes, and you're good.  No reason to read a manual or anything.  This baby is ready to go out of the box.

The only downside of it, and all ipods, is the headphones.  They sound awful.  You're much better off with just about anything.  Personally, I like the Bose QuietComfort, but for working out, I just for some of those $20 noise-reduction earbuds that Amazon seems to be selling a lot of.  Not the best, but 10x better than the ones that come with the Shuffle.

If you're looking for something to workout with, this is a great one.  Otherwise, I'd spend a new more bucks and get a Nano or Touch.

I got two sets, one twin size in ivory, and, one queen size in sage.  They are well made, and fit the beds nice and tight, which makes it a bit tricky to get on, but no complaint, because they stay on better this way!  Also, they have a really pretty sheen to them, almost like sateen sheets, but they aren't slick to me.  These are comfortable and soft, nothing extraordinary, but a good buy at 39.99 each!  The weight is nice too, being 400 thread count, so they will still be good on warm nights.  I gave the queen set to my parents, and they love them.  The color is more of a deeper green and to the brown, but, it is lovely and actually matches a flower patterned multi colored bed ruffle they have perfectly!  My only complaint is they are already starting to show some piling, after only a few months.  I wouldn't expect this from finer quality sheets, so, I am a bit disappointed in that.  I wouldn't buy these again for myself, only because my favorite sheets are Pure Beech jersey; they feel a lot like an upper end cotton jersey, more like silk, and they are great for both warm and cool nights, so, it's hard to like other sheets much compared to these!  Overall, a great buy at 39.99, thank you again Amazon!

This juicer REALLY is as great as all of the reviews say.  I've only had my juicer for three days, and I'm already in love with it!  I've recently wanted to get into juicing, and after looking at different options and reading the reviews, I settled on this model and I'm glad I did.  Since I doubt that I can contribute anything that will make this juicer glow any brighter than it already does, let me just throw some things out there for those considering geting into juicing:

1) Like most everything else, juicing (in general) comes with a price.  In addition to the obvious start-up cost, consider the cost of fruit and vegetables.  True, it can be cheaper than store-bought juice, just realize that you're still going to be spending a pretty penny on the fruits/veggies if you want to get serious about juicing.

2) A lot of reviews seem to praise this machine for its ease of cleaning.  I can't imagine how difficult it is to clean other juicers, since this is the first one I've owned.  While its mostly dishwasher safe, its top rack only, and I've found that the plastic housing with the chute won't fit in my top rack.  Hence I must clean it by hand, and it is an awkward piece to wash out.  The dishwasher doesn't perfectly clean out the mesh basket, but I've found the included brush to be quite handy...just make sure to thoroughly scrub the inside of the basket first then the outside.  I have found, however, that simply rinsing it works fine if you're juicing multiple batches within a short period of time.

3) Yes the motor is extremely powerful.  Yes the blade is very efficient.  And yes, you still have to take the pits out of the peaches.  While you CAN juice pineapple with the rind on it, it's not really good for the juicer.  The book will instruct you to take the rind off of anything on which the rind is inedible, such as oranges, pineapples, and mangoes.  Just think: a Ginsu knife CAN cut through a copper pipe, but still, it's not good for the knife.  You will have to cut up larger fruits/veggies that don't fit in the chute whole.  It's not an inordinate amount of preparation, just realize that you will have to do some preparation.

Overall the juicer IS every bit as incredible as the reviews would have you believe, and I'm just getting started with mine!  I just wanted to write a review for those who are condiering getting into juicing.  I've found that I spend a lot more time in prep and clean-up than I thought I would, and I didn't realize how much fruits and veggies can cost.  However, I absolutely love my new hobby and would strongly encourage that anyone who's considering it start out with this juicer.  It really does seem to be the case that you get what you pay for when it comes to juicing, and for me, the frustrations associated with a lesser juice makes all the difference between a lifelong hobby and a dust collector!

I loved both "Twilight" and "New Moon" with a passion, so I was extremely excited to find "Eclipse" on display at a small bookshop in Penn Station, put out two days before the release date. I bought the book, and started reading it as soon as I finished the other book I was reading at the time ("Gilda Joyce and the Ghost Sonata"). The first chapter of the book left an unfamiliar sour taste in my mouth; it was overly cutesy, spending way too much page space on describing how perfect Edward is, and how much Bella is in love with him. Returning readers already knew that, and I doubt those who never picked up a "Twilight" book before are daft enough to not `get' how much she loves him without having the cutsieness of it shoved in their faces the way it is in chapter one. 

However, after the first chapter, the book does pick up. The conflict inside Bella, symbolized by the conflict between Edward (vampire) and Jacob (werewolf) leads to some of the most interesting character development and self-discovery that Meyer has done with her protagonist. Not to mention, the fact that Edward has promised to turn her into a vampire in "New Moon" hangs over this book like a pendulum, adding a lot of intensity and poignancy to every decision that Bella makes. Though the book did drag in the middle, those themes sustained the life of the book. But... 

A problem I had with this book is the way that Edward often treats and refers to Bella as if she were a child or even a possession. Particularly in his confrontation with Jacob after Bella breaks her hand. Bella takes no issue with this, other than the instance when she gets mad that he doesn't let her visit Jacob (early in the book). The thing is, that would be an interesting character flaw for Edward, but the fact that Bella isn't opposed to this at all makes those parts of the story disconcerting. There is another instance related to this problem when Jacob forcibly kisses her, physically holding her face so that she can't stop him. Bella gets mad at Jacob. Not for the fact that he forced himself on her, but because of the fact that she is "with Edward" and he violated that. Stephenie Meyer is so intent on making the Bella/Edward relationship seem romantic and infallible that she--as well as her character Bella--refuse to see the very large flaw in their love. 

The development of both Meyer's vampire and werewolf mythology is thrilling, as it's completely original without really setting out and trying to be something different. "Eclipse" expands on how people become werewolves, how werewolves interact with each other, how vampires are born and how they die, and--most interestingly--the dynamic of how newborn vampires are made and their relationships with those who've made him. There is a thrilling, climatic fight scene at the end, which is both built-up to perfectly, and the wind-down is just as good. If the entire book were as good as the last two hundred-pages, this would be a perfect novel. But, that's not the case. So, while this is--in some ways--thematically better/more interesting than "Twilight" and "New Moon" the problems I've listed above drag it down to be a little less enjoyable than the two books that came before it. 

Generously,

My wife's Christmas present this year is a Keurig B70 coffee maker. We have a B100 at work that I was very impressed by and we decided that a home machine would nicely fill the need when we might want a cup or two, but might not want to make a full pot.

Long story short: we love the machine. So far, our favorite coffee is Timothy's Kona Blend -- but we haven't tried more than a handful of the scores of varieties of coffees and teas available for the beast. We got the extra filter for when we want to grind and use our own coffee in the machine, but have not yet had the opportunity to try it yet. It is a nice option to have.

We'll still use our Zojirushi thermal carafe brewer when we need a full pot, but the Keurig is wonderful for lesser amounts. Highly recommended.

I learned today that one of the coffee roasters that supplies the K-cups, Green Mountain, just bought Keurig (an American company with a Dutch name). I hope this won't limit the variety of coffees available for the machines -- that would be a major bummer if other roasters bowed out and would cause me to pull my glowing recommendation.

UPDATE 7/30/07:  The B70 died today after 8 months of yeoman service.  A call to Keurig revealed that the symptoms matched a "bad element" (one would assume heating element).  A replacement machine in on its way (arrival in 3-4 days).  Keurig doesn't want the old machine back, just a part.  Keurig customer service was extremely pleasant and professional.  Assuming the replacement machine arrives in good form, the five star rating is intact.  I do wonder if there is a generic problem with heating elements in this model -- I'll have to look through the newer reviews to see if I should worry.

We were at our wit's end trying to stop one of our dogs from chasing rabbits and squirrels across the nearby street. I hated to resort to a "shock collar" - it sounds so inhumane - but we decided to give PetSafe a try. I used it on myself, and it doesn't actually hurt so much as feel really weird and uncomfortable. I made sure to look up the proper methods for e-collar training on dogs (http://www.uwsp.edu/PSYCH/dog/LA/castle3.htm), and within a week, our crazy hunter was staying near us and mostly ignoring the furry meals scurrying around the yard! If you use it properly, this is a wonderful product!

I got this as a Christmas gift, and while it was useful for a while, the ring part broke off from my keychain a couple of months back. Using Superglue isn't fixing the problem as the ring just breaks again, and while I might carry it around in my backpack once school starts up, that's nowhere near as handy as having it on my keyring. They should have the ring made out of metal to prevent this from happening. Other than that, it's been a great product, with way more space than I'll ever need. If anyone knows of a way to fix this problem, please post below, as I'd love to keep using this on my keychain but haven't found any solution.

I stopped using Iomega products several years ago (remember the infamous "click of death" infesting Iomega Zip drives?) But after reading the Amazon reviews, I decided to get the Iomega 1TB drive.

It is about half the size of my old 350 MB Maxtor hard drives, costs half as much, and has three times the storage capacity! I plugged it in and Windows XP had it up and running in seconds, no fuss.

As a test, I transferred two gigs of photos (I'm a photojournalist) and it backed up two gigs in two minutes. It is almost perfectly silent.

I didn't bother downloading the free Retrospect Backup software; I always back up manually as part of my business routine.

Does anyone know what is the difference between these 2, other than the price and difference in GB memory, but both hold same amount of time video? Now I don't know much about computers, tech or electronics, but doesn't the memory determine how much does it hold? Why are these 2 different memory but hold same amount of video time? I would appreciate if I get an answer to this question since I would love to order this as soon as posible, but unsure which is best. Obviously would prefer to buy the cheaper one but is the other one better? I really don't see extra features for the second one. Would any of these work the same on my Apple OS X without having to get extra cables or software?, I need something easy to save videos of my babies and send them to grandparents in Mexico.

The gods must be crazy is probably the best comedy that has ever come out of South Africa! Its a comedy for the whole family to enjoy about a busman named Xi and his adventures... In the first movie, he finds a Coca Cola bottle that he beleives fell from the gods and was ment to be a gift. But it brings bad luck and tention in his tribe, so he sets out to throw the bottle off the edge of the world to give it back to the gods, because he beleives it is evil. But its his whacky adventures as he gets caught up between terroists, miss understanding people and so much more that will have you laughing your tooshies off!The second movie shows our little bushmans children accidently be taken away on a truck, and Xi goes in search to find them. He finds himself in another whacky adventure! Along with alot of over the top slapstick comedy, but its great comedy!The bonus footage isnt worth watching again. the first disc comes with photos, but there photos of the town and village the movie was shot in, but in more recent times, there not photos from the film! And theres a 20 minute long footage of catching up with the man who played Xi, but they dont translate what he says which is weird? The second disc has a just over 5 minute long of some guy remembering the director. And a couple of trailers to other films.Overall, this is a great comedy, very underrated, everyone who has seen it should have enjoyed it! And I recomend you buy the two together! The second isnt as funny as the first, but it still is pretty good! But I highly recomend that you never buy &quot;gods must be crazy in hong kong&quot; i think it was called? that was pretty bad!!! But these two are classics, and should be more popular then they are, you should enjoy them if you like a silly slapstick laugh set in the African desert and bushlands!

I've been using this for about six months now; I previously had the older vertical-style Zojirushi maker. Some observations:

Unlike as is mentioned in many of the notes here, my loaves come out too dark even on the lightest setting, particularly the 1.5 lb. ones. I tried programming it for a shorter baking phase, but it appears that the machine is too smart for this; it raises the baking temperature so that the loaf comes out even browner.

Other than that, I use it mostly for mixing dough. The features I bought it for (programmable phases, loaf shape) work fine. But I do wish they supported programmable rising temperatures. When the dough comes out of the maker, it's been rising at 100F and won't continue rising satisfactorily at a lower temperature, so I have to put it in a makeshift proofing box (my oven, preheated for one minute.) This does not work for French bread, which wants to rise at 72F for many hours to develop flavor.

I may also have found a solution to the lopsided loaf problem: I adjust the paddles so they are facing each other before I add the ingredients. It doesn't come out perfect but seems better to me. Does this work for anyone else?

Totally plug and play in Windows XP. No software or drivers to load. Uploads and downloads documents quickly (I haven't used it for much beyond Word docs at this point). My only minor complaint is that the key ring loop should be on the cap instead of on the end of the unit. As it is, when you remove the cap, while it does fit on the end, if you have the drive on a key ring or necklace, the cap won't go on and would be easy to lose or leave behind. Still, a great, inexpensive product. (If you buy two and get the free shipping, it's a real bargain.)

Pros
- low power as advertised - measured the power consumption using kill-a-watt with 2 NAS connected to the switch. The reading was 2 Watt. Swapped the switch to Netgear GS605 (5-port gigabit switch), the reading was 5 Watt. D-link also really does power saving, I disconnect one NAS from the switch, power drops to 1 Watt, and I disconnect the last NAS, power reading drops to 0 Watt. Since I NAS running 24/7, power saving is important as it adds up the cost, I dumped m Netgear gigabit switch and swapped to Dlink 
- Plug and Play, Reliable - the thing just worked. I have owning one since Dec 2007, it's been running 24/7 and it does not fail on me yet. I purchased another two recently to expand NAS home network.

Cons
- Outdated outside design - perhaps D-link could work a bit more on on the cosmetic appearance. This switch probably blend into work environment ok but for home I personally think Netgear GS605/GS608 offer a more friendly appearance for home network switch.
- No vertical stand - why D-link doesn't provide a vertical stand for this switch?

Have you ever been somewhere that you needed your own computer and software to do some important work? You say that's what you have a laptop for? Sure, but when you can simply plug a memory stick into just about any PC with a USB port and some decent specs - do your work, eject the stick and have off with you! Don't try to tell me that's not easier than lugging even a small laptop. Well, it's Miller time, and you have U3 to thank...

My boyfriend has a large hairy Siberian Husky.  Since moving in together, I've been going crazy over how much hair the dog sheds.  I love the dog but her hair drove me crazy.  Hair flies off her body when she's walking...  Then a friend recommended the Furminator.  My boyfriend was skeptical that it actually works better than the old brush his had forever.  So we did a comparison brush with the his brush and my new Furminator.  That's the last time he brought up the topic.  As I pulled the lump of hair off of the Furminator, he tossed his brush in the trash...

This kettle looks, feels, acts and is expensive.  So if you like "high-end" stuff, this is the kettle for you.  It has a great weight to it and everything feels well made (this coming from someone who hopes to be designing products for the rest of her life).  It's quiet and boils water quickly.  The "ding" when it's done is a little quiet so I often forget I've been boiling water, but I'm sure that if it were louder, I'd complain as such.  I was worried about regretting spending $70 on a kettle, but I'm glad I did.  I have no regrets, and it's worth $70 to pay for a great kettle that I use every day!

After 25 years our entry level Kitchen Aid gave up the ghost having provided years of homemade bread, pizza dough and cookies for a family of 5. Everyone was home for Christmas, and they fought over who could use the new 6Qt pro model.  A huge hit. No one had the least trouble switching from the tip back to the crank design. This had the best price and almost instant shipping. I couldn't be happier.

RELATIONSHIPS. That is what this movie is about. It is about the relationships between the men of a firehouse that depend upon each other. It is about a marriage and depending on each other, wife to husband, and he to her. The movie is about parent relationships--the kind that last a lifetime. The movie is about God, and a personal relationship with Him. RELATIONSHIPS!

From the makers of "FACING the GIANTS", this newest movie, "Fireproof", has surpassed what many 'Hollywood' movies attain. It is an emotional roller coaster that will have you gasping, laughing, crying, holding your breath, wanting to scream a warning...and perhaps, even a standing ovation at the end. The movie is filled with plenty of firefighting action, hero stunts, as well as some of the most tender moments ever placed on film.

Capt. Caleb Holt (Kirk Cameron) must try to guide the firehouse team through many emergencies, training, and firehouse interaction while he sees his marriage dissolving on the home front. He gives up on the marriage...UNTIL...his father convinces him to wait 40 days and follow what he calls a "The Love Dare," a daily task written out in a notebook by the father's own hand. Wife Catherine (Erin Bethea), also is ready to dissolve the marriage going nowhere. She gets attention at work from a young doctor and decides a divorce is needed as soon as possible. Caleb accepts his dad's challenge but his daily attempts seem only to fail. Fortunately, a fellow firefighter, Lt. Michael Simmons (Ken Bevel) is a constant, dedicated, and Christian friend as well as co-worker.

There will be many who will say this movie is for every couple that is having difficulties and their marriage relationship is in jeopardy. That is true, BUT, this marriage is even better for working marriages, marriages that yet have some flame, at least a spark, so they can see again what is important in life and in a relationship. Not to "Fireproof" the marriage but to "fan the flames."

And just when the movie's ending arrives, you are wishing it never had to end, and your bag of popcorn has caught the last tear, there is one additional surprise extra-ending. I'll not spoil it. What a wonderful job of writing by brothers, Stephen and Alex Kendrick. Alex also directed. What a ministry/witness by the entire production staff, cast, and the church that prays and accomplishes a product like this story.

I agree with others, when available, give it as a gift. The gift that keeps on giving. 5 gems for the crowns of everyone associated with this picture.

I have been a PC user for many years now (since 1997, when I got my first Pentium MMX running at 233 MHz), but after recently purchasing the MacBook Pro from Apple, I have to say my Windows days are over. I had previously played with a PowerBook and was thinking about getting a Mac, but not really knowing anything about the operating system or compatibility with other machines not running Leopard kept me away. Now, after getting the MacBook Pro, i have to say there is nothing more simple and intuitive than the Mac OS. A fine product, with attention to detail. As they say in the ads, even the power plug is a feature. Overall, the Mac seems to have been thought of as a jewel running everything with no errors rather than as a computer. It looks great and works just as well. 10+

First I'd like to comment that I ordered this machine and the 2gig RAM update from Amazon on a Saturday afternoon and had it on Monday.  I must compliment Amazon on this order.  They said I could have it on Monday and I did.  On to the computer...

I am a road warrior.  I work as a guitar tech for International rock bands and thus, travel a lot.  I always have a notebook computer with me and have lusted for a little netbook since they came out but I wanted a usable computer, not just an email device.  I have been researching and watching them improve since.  This device is the best one out there right now.

This little machine is great.  Period.  It is well built.  The keyboard is great for touch typing.  The mouse pad is basically as big as those on my full size HP machines and works as well.  It runs very quiet, I can barely hear the cooling fan and the hard drive is virtually silent.  Battery life is unbelievable.  The screen is wonderful.  It is very bright and at half brightness looks as bright as a normal notebook screen.  Transferring movies from a usb drive is much faster than it is on my HP laptop (4 year old Centrino).  Upgrading the memory or hard drive is as easy as it gets.  The cam works great on Skype.  Another thing I love about this machine is, Asus didn't load it down with a bunch of worthless software.  Sure, there were a few things I got rid of but for the most part, they don't give you a bunch of crap.  They don't even include trial virus software which is fine with me since I was planning to install ZoneAlarm anyway.  Wireless reception seems to be as good as my full size notebooks and the Bluetooth works great connecting to my cell phone for Internet sharing.

For the money, at this time, this IS the machine to get.  It has all the features of the Samsung though is easier to upgrade, has a slightly faster processor and is about $75 less.  Did I mention the battery?  Wow!

At last, the DVD has finally arrived! I couldn't wait to get my hands on it when they released it in stores. My family and I purchased this movie the very day it was released, and we all loved it as we watched it together. 

The people at Disney certainly did an excellent job on improving the original movie. They totally cleaned it up, made the colors brighter, the images more vivid--they even enhanced the sound, too. This film has definitely received the special kind of treatment that few other movies get these days. 

I'll bet just about everybody knows the story of the Little Mermaid, with Ariel, the headstrong teenage mermaid; Eric, the handsome swashbuckling prince that wins Ariel's heart; King Triton, the ruler of the sea and Ariel's mighty (yet overly protective and highly prejudiced) father; Sebastian, the hilarious reggae crab; Flounder, the friendly yet paranoid fish and Ariel's dearest friend; Scuttle, the goodhearted yet bumbling seagull; and of course, Ursula, the nasty old witch who intends to steal Triton's crown and take over the whole sea. 

This movie is very romantic, and very thrilling too. My favorite scenes are the storm at sea and the intense battle against Ursula towards the end. Both scenes make me tingle just about every time I watch them. Aside from romance and action, there's plenty of humor in this movie as well, to keep things from being too serious or scary for little kids. Probably the best scene of humor is the "Les Poissons" scene, between Sebastian and the royal French chef, Louis. That scene is enough to crack anybody up. 

But what really makes this DVD a terrific purchase is the music. It totally has a grip on you, from the beginning to the end. The people who wrote and composed this kind of music are total geniuses. 

Throughout this entire movie, you are hardly bored for one minute. It is just so excellent, with a big capital "E". I recommend this DVD to anybody who is a family person, a fan of Disney, and has a great love for music.

This is a great product. In past few weeks i gained 10 Lbs and i went from 157LB to 167LB. After talking to my friends they suggested that only walking can help me burn this fat.
So i ordered this product and i set my goal for 8 miles a day, 15000 aerobic steps, 25000 steps, 50g Fat burn daily and i lost almost 12 LBS and got my BMI down to 23.3. Offcourse you have to look what you are eating first, cutting down on to your calories especially Fat calories intake with also help.
Its a great product to measure and keep up with your goal. Another thing you can download all data to a PC and look at in terms of graph.

And yes it is also very accurate in counting steps. So go ahead and buy one without a second thought. You have to enter a bit of information first in it like your age, sex, weight, stride length etc.
thats it aftert that it is ready to go with you for a walk

I have had the NC10 for about 2 months.  I put in a 2gb memory - no other changes.  I added a stock trading software platform that supposedly needed a 2.5ghz system ... it runs no problem.  The performance is excellent overall.  ONE COMPLAINT:  I'm not sure if it is just typical of Windows based systems or a hardware problem, but when I boot it up, about 30% of the time it hangs up and I have to power down - then power back up.  Very annoying!  I'm not sure if there is a solution ... Windows people seem to learn to live with this stuff.  Battery life is very nice - about 4 hours.

I purchased this pedometer with the idea I can put it in my pocket and not need to wear it.  I have tried that, but it is not accurate when placed in a pocket.  If it is supposed to count EACH step and when placed in a pocket it only counts SOME steps, then what good is it?  

Also, the clip design is off.  It is too low and falls off quite often.  Fortunately there is a strap, so when it falls off the pants, the strap keeps it dangling until you can replace it.  

I would not necessarily recommend this pedometer.  I had an Omron round pedometer, that I liked much better.  Unfortunately, I ran that one through the washing machine and it fell apart.  :(

In retrospect, I would have re-bought the round one that I had in the first place.

I bought this to keep a medium sized dog in a room without having to shut the door. It's strong enough to hold his 60 pounds when he stands on it to see what's going on in the other room, and the gravity powered auto-shutting gate works flawlessly. The only issue that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it's secured to the wall with adjustable legs (padded, so they do not leave a mark on the wall), but because of the gate opening, the legs can't be adjusted tight enough to make the gate 100% unmoveable. It's almost 100% secure, but tightening the legs too much prevents the gate from shutting. I would not use it for a child near stairs, but as I said, it holds up under the weight of a 60 pound dog so it works for me.

I had been making my own yogurt for some time, incubating with hot water, a insulated cooler, etc. It worked, but was time consuming and you had to babysit the jars of yogurt...this is much easier. Keep in mind you still have to scald and cool the milk before adding starter, it doesn't do that for you. But once that is done (and a cool water bath speeds up the process) put it in here (after preheating), wait a few hours and you're done. I've found that yogurt incubates much more quickly in this gadget than my &quot;old way,&quot; which sometimes took overnight or longer, resulting in very tart yogurt. As other reviewers have mentioned, you can use a wide mouth mason jar as a supplement or to replace the plastic container. I am mystified by those who said that they had to rig special dimmer switches, splice electrical controls onto the plug, etc., to get the correct temperature...just out of curiosity I measured/monitored the tempurature during incubations on several different occasions and it always hovered around 110 degrees. So I'm guessing these folks had malfunctioning thermostats on the machines....anyway, it's reasonably priced, works well and will easily pay for itself if you use a lot of yogurt, particularly organic yogurt.

My 11 month old twins love this dvd. We had bought the first dvd "My Baby Can Talk" and were so impressed with it, we had to have this one too.  We were not disappointed.  This is the same high quality as the first and just as engaging.  I have tried a couple of other sign videos on the market and have only played them once.  But the "My Baby Can Talk" series gets played over and over.  We have only been practicing signing for about two months.  My little girl initiates three signs.  I am sure my son is not far behind.  It is exciting to have your child be able to tell you what he or she needs.  I highly recommend this dvd.

Pampers are great diapers for little ones under 9 months.  After my son crawls, I might try Huggies supreme again, due to the elastic waist band and slimmer cut between the legs. Little babies that don't sit or crawl, really don't need Huggies features, as it just makes for gaps in the diapers legs, which causes the Huggies to leak out the legs.

Nothing is perfect of course and if you dig deep enough  you can usually find something to complain about, but I will say that you are going to have to dig deep to find something to carp about with this one.

Pro:
Flawless synchronization with Blackberry 8330 Curve (Verizon)
Fast File Transfer
Super small form factor (never has to be removed!)

Cons:
Terrible support of drivers
    a.) Disk supplied in package is outdated version compared to what is on IOGear support website
    b.) Drivers listed on website (v5) seem to install fine, however, the Blackberry Desktop Software (used for synch with Outlook) does not see the Blackberry connection.

After fighting this install for way too long, I emailed tech support.  Good news is that they were quick and accurate with response.  Bad news is:
  1.) Yet a new driver recommended (v6).  Tech support included a link to another place on their site where the download and install instructions are located.  (http://www.iogear.com/support/faq/id/289).  The driver is listed as being "x21" compatibile, but this is confusing as the actual install references two previous adapters - 221 and 321 - which makes you wonder if it is actually going to work for this model - 421.
   2.) Install was less than stellar.  Instructions are wrong for the x421 install.  You actually need to launch the Setup.exe file in the unzipped file list...not the one the instructions tell you to.  Once you launch, you get an error saying that the device is not plugged in.  Once I plugged in, away it went.
   3.) Now it works for the Blackberry, but I was plagued with yet another error saying that a device driver could not be found.  This occurred after the original install - when attempting to pair the Blackberry.  I finally ignored the error and the synchronization is working fine.

So, if you have concerns about actual performance of other models, get this one, as it seems to run great and has a very small form factor - you never have to unplug it.  BUT, if you can't handle the hassle or have found another model that works fine, STAY AWAY as the driver issue was painful.  (Hopefully the description above will help others with their problems, or prevent problems for those reading prior to install.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)

      



Before I was even offered this product, I kept looking through the small grouping of reviews here and asked myself, "do all of these people work for Ooma?"  Needless to say, I was a bit skeptical of this newfound device and its promise, echoed by the reviewers here, that you'd have sound quality better than your landline, with no monthly bills and tons of extras.  So, when I got my box and eagerly set it up in an attempt to sneer in a review about how wrong everyone was, I found myself shocked.  This thing ain't bad at all!

Setting up is a complete breeze that took all of five minutes, as advertised.  Basically, you go to the ooma site, create an account, pair up the Ooma hub's information to your account, decide whether to port over your phone number or choose a new one and you're pretty much done.  As far as actual set-up is concerned, you just use an enclosed ethernet cord to run from your modem to the device, then from your device to your router and you're done with that portion.  You'll also need to plug in the hub into your wall outlet, then the phone into your hub.  It sounds more complex on paper than in actuality, and there's plenty of pictures for those not tech-savvy.

The way it works is that you have to have either the hub or the scout for each phone.  Here is where you could potentially spend more money than you anticipate because each receive will need to have a scout, which costs extra money.  One way to work around this (and the way mine is set up) is by using a cordless phone.  I have two cordless phones, with a hub and a scout, and I only need to plug in the cordless phone hub into the ooma hub for both phones to work.  

I've tested the ooma, keeping my original phone line, for almost a month and I am content with the sound quality.  Originally, I was a bit miffed at the sound quality.  There was a pronounced echo of my voice flying back at me that the first time I heard it, I stopped talking.  This is a problem I've heard some people deal with, with other VoIP services.  However, I was able to fix it by changing the upload speed in the settings menu of the device; this completely fixed the problem and I haven't had an issue since.

One problem I do have with the device is the (for lack of better title) "ooma sound" that happens when you turn on the phone or when someone connects with it.  It makes this brief swirling sound that transforms into the ring tone when you pick up.  That itself isn't annoying.  But when someone else picks up, the sound comes back and a couple times that's happened, I had to repeat myself to the caller.  It's also a bit distracting to be trying to greet the person/ask a question when the sound starts.  I haven't discovered a way to turn it off.

EDIT: According to a helpful commenter below, I have discovered that you can turn off the "ooma sound" by calling the ooma support line.  Will be checking this out, but that definitely takes away one of my big complaints!

Another issue that isn't unique to ooma but VoIP in general is that if you lose internet connection or if something causes your connection to degrade, you will lose voice quality or, in the case of no internet, lose your phone service.  Additionally, you need to have broadband internet; my internet provider provides me with speeds up to 15 MB/s and, for me, I have had absolutely no issues.  But I can't say if that will be true with slower speeds.

That said, there are some really nice features, not taking into consideration the "standard" ones like caller ID, etc.  For instance, you can log into your ooma lounge to listen to your voice messages or call from a separate phone to hear them, delete them, etc.  An even cooler feature, for me, is the ability to set up a text message service or email service that will send a text to your cell phone or an email to your email account that lists the phone number, the fact you have a voice message and information on how to access your phone from away.  It's a cool feature that many probably won't use, but it just adds to the user-friendliness of the system.

And, of course, the best feature that is the main reason to look to ooma: no monthly phone bill.  This is one of those items where the $250 is a steal.  With my phone bill of $25 a month, in ten months you'll have paid for the device.  Everything after that is just gravy.  The Ooma really surprised me.  I went in with a cynical frame of mind, expecting the reviews to be blowing smoke, but I'm coming out of it with the plans on canceling my phone service this week.  I can't think of any better praise than that.

I've had this keyboard for a few weeks now and everyday I love it more and more. I am quite a gamer. This keyboard makes it easier to play games where I can define keys for certain tasks.The gaming z-engine allows you to customize the entire keyboard for a variety of games. Check the Ideazon website for a list. I really enjoy the illuminated keyboard. Makes playing games in the dark quite a thrill. Right now I am partial to the blue color. Being able to change the intensity is a plus. The built in gamepad easily replaces WASD. What an improvement over a regular keyboard. The keyboard also has two 2.0 USB ports as well as a microphone jack. Setup is very straight forward. Drivers can be found at the Ideazon website also. All in all I am rather pleased with this product.

in the 20th and 21st centuries, he might well have written this story.  It's that kind of tale:  Unlikely underdog rises from despair due to pluck, perseverance and highly improbable coincidence.  And yet it works.

Make no bones; it's a dark-toned film in the early going, especially the first half hour or so.  You will see the kind of gut-wrenching, cruel beyond belief poverty and exploitation that will make you want to turn away.   I won't lie, 15 minutes into the movie if my friend had said, I'd like to go, I would have.  (But what a mistake that would have been!)  As usual, the ads may be misleading so if your tastes run to typical bollywood (or even hollywood) light-hearted & all feel-good, move along cause this ain't it.  I can understand how some viewers don't want to see the ugly reality of this young man's world, but I would also counter that we can't pretend it's not the way life is for some. 

But that being said, if you will give the film the time it needs to tell this story, I think you might be sucked into Jamal's narrative, just as I was.    You might come to admire his resolve; his single-mindedness and the idea that he believes in the future -- not that he will be rich, mind you -- but that he will find the girl who is his destiny despite all of the things that keep pulling them apart.  Ultimately, his motivation is not the money, but doing right by the girl who was left behind.   As the layers unfold of how Jamal came to knows what he knows, I became as intrigued as the police captain who is interrogating him.  

But beyond the love story, there's the equally compelling relationship of the two brothers.  Jamal's brother Salim alternately exploits, protects, and betrays him throughout the film as the story spans through their childhood, teenage, and young adult years.  They survive together and end up taking very different paths as young men.  But in the end, blood proves out.

I loved it! My second favorite (Twilight still my fav!) I totally do not understand why some did not care for it! I am baffled by it! I thought it had alot of unexpected plot twists and surprises (I LOVE SURPRISES!) I have decided to write out exactly what I loved about it! Be warned spoilers below.



1. I loved the wedding! I was annoyed in with her reluctance to marry him (Who wouldn't want to marry him???) but was very pleased when she saw him and was happy and not just going through the motions.

2. I loved the honeymoon! It seemd very real and true to the characters (also funny at parts) but didn't get raunchy or anything!

3. I loved the pregnancy surprise totally not what I was expecting?
I loved the suspense created by wondering what the heck was in there and what the child would be like?

4. Love the birth/vamp conversion scene! Whoa that was intense! Iloved the creativity of the syringe full of venom stabbed in her heart! Loved that it was Edward and Jacob who had to deliver the baby and then try to save Bella (would not have been as intense had it been Carlise)

5. Loved Bella as a Vampire! Enough said

6. In the 3 previous books its was all about everyone and their momma trying to save Bella and I loved that it was her in the end that saved everyone else! I always saw Bella as the true hero of the books only held back by her frail human state so I was thrilled by this angle!

7.Last but not least I loved the fairytale ending! I loved that they got their cake and were able to eat it too so to speak! It felt like that was exactly how it was meant to be all along.

I will agree that this book was very different from the other three! It felt far removed somehow like it took place several years down the road from Eclipse not several months. There were a few things that bothered me a bit like the imprinting and the child's name but other than that I really really enjoyed it!

I chose this pedometer on a recommendation from a friend.  Other models I have seen have either been too basic, with not enough features, or have been so complicated that the instruction manual is an inch thick.  This one is right in the middle.  The only complaint I have, which other people have said, is that the clip may work its way off your waist when you bend over.  There is another clip that comes with it that you can use to keep it from falling on the ground when this happens, I just haven't clipped that part on yet.  Otherwise this gets high marks, especially for the price.

I've had the Professional 600 for about a week now, and have made a double batch of cinnamon rolls (~20 rolls), a double batch of whole-wheat bread (2 loaves), and a batch of blueberry sorbet (using the ice-cream making attachment).  I think I'm in love.  :-)  Everything has turned out _great_, unlike the last time I tried to make whole-wheat bread by hand and ended up with something that could be used as a building material.  The rolls were chewy and rich, the bread was fluffy and light (quite a trick for whole-wheat bread in my experience) and the sorbet was airy and delicious, even though we cheated and didn't chill the ingredients completely or freeze it afterwards as the instructions call for, since we were making it at 10:00pm and wanted to try it right away.  This is the first fairly heavy-duty counter-top appliance I've purchased in quite some time, and I'm very happy with it.  I almost bought the smaller "Artisan" model, but after reading a review that seemed to indicate it was under-powered and lightly-built, I decided to go nuts and buy the 600.  My initial impression on taking it out of the box was, "Wow - this thing is heavy and built like a tank."  Using it has not changed that impression so far.  It's easy to set up and attach accessories to, and installing and removing the bowl is (literally) a snap.  It has a smooth, flowing exterior design with no unnecessary protrusions, making it very easy to clean.  Based on my experience so far, I'd recommend it without reservation.  Now, get in the kitchen and make some home-made bread and other goodies!

First off, my wife was against this product when I bought it.  Mainly due to the price.  However having an instant hot water machine around (instant soup, oatmeal, water for her tea bags) has won her over handily.

As far as the coffee maker goes, it may be too good.  Seriously.  I can actually taste slight differences between the individual K-cups of the same variety.  The first batch of Heifer blend I got was absolutely delicious.  This latest batch less so.  That's where I see this product has room to grow.  Consistency of coffee packaged in the K-cup.  I do however see the challenge of blending several hundreds of pounds of beans together and then trying to get the same ratio in little Tablespoon sized cups. 

I've tried quite a few varieties of coffee now and would like to share my favorites.  Just so you know, I hate burned and coffee that's so thick you can chew it.  The darker the roast the less caffeine in the bean so a "stiff" cup of coffee won't do as much as a light blend to pick you up.  My favorites have a wonderful flavor that lingers after you finish the cup so much so that I drive by starbucks and am not even tempted to pull over.  This was one of the things I was hoping to accomplish by purchasing this maker, to actually pay off the machine by not going to Starbucks or Carribou Coffee so much.  It's working.

Green Mountain's Heifer Hope Blend, Diedrich's Colombia blend, and Timothy's Decaf Columbian  are my favorites.  Wonderful sweet flavors, with a chocolaty aftertaste that linger long after you've finished your last sip.  

In contrast I was disappointed in the K-cup offerings for Chai.  I prefer Stash brand chai or Starbuck's Chai.  Both brands offered here were pale imitators.  Here's an instance to just use the hot water function and brew your own.

The brew pump is whisper quiet, but the pump that fills the hot water tank from the reservoir is louder than I hoped for. It makes a buzzing sound.  (Ever thought of using the same part for both functions????)

As for the cups a little quick surgery shows that it is a plastic cup with a little filter liner that stops about half the way down the cup, filled with coffee, then sealed with foil.  

Highs:
Wonderful coffee a cup at a time.
Quick and convenient.
Lots of brand choices with more on the horizon.
Less trips to expensive coffee houses!

Lows:
"Buzzing" priming pump
Need to tighten up consistency of K-cups a little
Chai offerings are weak.

This is the first video camera I've purchased in many years. I did my homework before purchasing for my boyfriend. He and his teenage son absolutely loves it! It's so small and the pricetag is really an incentive. They're making videos to share with friends and family. I love the concept of making videos to save to the hard drive of the camera. You can email the video or save it via several options. This camera is rated highly; even over the Sony options. You will not regret this purchase. Walmart has the camera bag plus an sd card that will blow you away. This camrea though is more expensive at walmart. Buy the camera and enjoy; this purchase will not be regretted.

I love this DVD, I just finished my 20th workout with the DVD, 22 days since I started, skipped two days due to calf tightness issues (discussed below).  My endurance and strength have gone way up as a result of this program.  And I am down an average of 5 lbs. since I started (currently 185lbs., 6 ft., male).

Jillian's energy is great and the program is challenging and she challenges you to "fight for it" as you are going through the exercises.

It is "20 minutes of intensity" which is true.  Before that is a little warm up.  And after that is a little stretching.  About 27 minutes in all.

The first day I bailed out after five minutes of the 20 minutes of intensity @ Level 1 (the beginning Level); I just didn't have any more in me.  But each day I tried to do more and more.  And I fought for it.  My goal is to be able to do the complete unmodified Level 1 by day 30.  I am there except for a few pushups and a few static lunges with bicep curls.

My strategy is to do what I can and if I can't, rest and continue as soon as I can.  Maybe 5 seconds later, maybe more.  And then get back to it.

Calf issues:  My calves got very tight as a result of doing this program.  Level 1 consists of two 30 second sets of jumping jacks (during the warm up), then three more 30 second sets of jumping jacks, plus three 30 second sets of imaginary jump roping, plus three sets of running in place butt kicks.  That is five and a half minutes of pounding on the calves, which is okay if your calves don't tighten up too much.  But mine did.  I feared pulling a muscle they got so tight, so I took two days off.  I did some research and found out how to give myself a calf massage and also worked on stretching my calves.  That did the trick and the tightness is pretty much gone and certainly not an issue any more.  Another idea about the calf issue is that without enough water in the body this is more likely to happen.

Recommendations for when you get it:

1. If you are someone who needs to know how much work is ahead of them when you are doing this program, count the number of repetitions for the exercises that you will have to do to match what the models are doing and you will be able to mentally prepare yourself for what is ahead of you if that is an issue.  Since I like to know how close I am to being done with a tough exercise, this helps me a lot.

2. Start this program and stay with it.  If you seem like if you keep doing something you will injure yourself on a particular day, don't do it.  You want to maximize what you accomplish and risking injuring yourself won't help.  But keep coming back and do what you can do every day.  And set goals for accomplishing more.

3. I sometimes chug a swallow from a water bottle in between some of the sets, but very quickly so as not to lose any of the repetitions.  This may be a security blanket for me until I am completely on top of it.  She allows no breaks.
 
Issues with the DVD/Production:

1. There is continual music with a beat but the beat doesn't seem to match the beat of the exercises.  Which means that if you are to stay at the same pace as the models you have to pay attention to them visually and cannot rely on just hearing the beat of the music to get the pace.

2. When you put the DVD in, it takes at least a couple of minutes before it allows you to start your exercise.  "Disc operation not allowed" is the message I get when I try to get to the menu to start.  I don't want to kill two minutes.

This is a fabulous program to increase physical and mental toughness and I rate the benefit at 5 stars for sure.  I would pay $100 for this if that was the cheapest I could get it, because it is easily that valuable to me.  But still, there is room for improvement.

Fight for it!

Gotta love this pet feeder. Super easy to set up. I don't know what some of these other folks are complaining about. I also followed another reviewer's suggestion to insert a barrier between the top and bottom with a smaller hole for my cats' small kibbles. I'll be leaving my cats for 3 days. I've tested this unit for a few days now and I'm confident they'll be fed properly. 

In my view, the only thing they could have improved on was to include 3 D batteries with my order. Aside from that, I'm very happy with my purchase.

I received the CH Rudder Pedals for Christmas 2005, and I am using them MS Flight Sim 2004.  The rudder pedals are very easy to install and configure. They are very durable and "very" sensative.  I especially like the toe brakes and the ability to perform tight taxi turns with the pedals.  There's nothing like being too high for an approach and being able to deliver hard left rudder and full right stick to slip the plane into a  proper approach.  To me, flight simulation without rudder pedals is like living in a two-dimensional flying world.

I rarely drank coffee before and I sure hated to make it!  That's all changed with the simplest coffeemaker I have yet to see.This is the easiest coffeemaker I have ever had BUT it still has all the bells and whistles you could want!  My fiance and I wake up to fresh coffee every morning via the programmable feature of it!  I love the water filter, it makes a real difference in the taste.  And...the carafe pours like a dream...it cannot even be described how easily the water and coffee flow out.Looks great on the counter.  Have not used the self cleaning feature yet but the removable coffee filter is wonderful.  No need to by filters again and no mess or hassle.All in all, this is a PERFECT machine.  The unit is compact and sturdy and its ease of use, excellent products make it very efficient and clean.  I love it!

I got the newer version of MS Office 2007 basically for the newer version of OneNote. It is a very good product, but it still needs improvement: better handling of tables, ability to setup the same "default page style" to new pages in all the documents not only that particular section... each time you create a new section you have to setup the "default page style" again... pretty annoying. The newer version of Word, Excel and PowerPoint adds nothing much over the 2003 version except for the new "ribbon". If you want to do your regular stuff quickly with the newer version... forget it... the classic distribution of commands and buttons are gone! It's a nightmare having to find where the heck the "auto correction" command is, or where the "slide master view" is hidden now, for instance, in the new "The Ribbon". You will need to learn again where are the commands, and some are deeply hidden underneath this obtrusive ribbon. Some I still have no idea how to access them, except by customizing the tool bar and add the commands I want to it. It's very annoying. I wish there would be an option to get the classic style back!! Overall it's a stable and good product.

I have a 10 month old purebred Bichon Frise. Only one of her eyes waters a little. The watering began when she was teething and loosing her baby teeth. Any watering on a pure white dog will stain no matter how much you clean it. 

I gave the lowest recommended dose to her on top of her food. Her appetite did not change. (However, the powder does get in her hair- which Bichons have a lot of, so I will sprinkle a little water on top to make it stick to the food better.)After 2 months and 2 monthly hair trims (which is a must for Bichons), my babies eyes are BOTH white now. I am starting to give this to her every other day and try to wean her off of it. So far, the stains have not come back.

BEFORE giving this to your dog I would recommend the following: #1- Check their diet for dyes, beets, or by-products. My dog eats only Innova Puppy Food, so there are no dyes, beets, or by-products causing the staining. #2- Check for stray hairs- My baby has the hair trimmed back from her eyes, so the watering is not irritation. #3- Use only Stainless Steel Bowls- others could have dyes in the plastics.

Let me start off by saying that i am a Mac FanBoy! However being away from my family (who live in Scotland nowadays) this netbook fit the bill and specs. I am familiar with Windows XP and wanted a simple machine which would be dedicated for Skype video calls only.  I would not consider other application usage on this machine. For skype the following observations:

1. Very good video camera on skype
2. Has all teh wifi standards needed
3. Loads up relatively fast with an O2 USB Mobile broadband 
4. Mic and speakers may need some adjustments till u reach the good quality sound 

I would add that for the best audio performance, one should consider getting the Plantronics DSP400 Foldable Multimedia Headset and possibly a small set of speakers (if u plan to communicate with toddlers) such as TeckNet AD-05 iPod Portable Speaker and Docking System for iPod Player  PRO-POWER - Portable speakers

The best netbook on the market at present. The 10" form factor is small enough to be portable but big enough to comfortably view and type on. I considered the MSI Wind and ASUS 10" netbooks, but the Samsung seemed worth the higher price for the better keyboard layout and better looks and more solid case. The 6 cell battery makes it weigh a little more than I'd like, but getting 6+ hours out of the battery is worth it.

PROS
Great keyboard, Superior build quality, good camera, speakers, battery, screen. Even has VGA Out, 3 USB Ports, and an SD Card Slot (Take that MacBook Air!)

CONS/Quibbles (none significant)
Single mouse button that rocks left and right and is a bit too firm, Trackpad could be a little bigger, Comes with annoying trial McAfee anti-virus, otherwise clean design marred by "Digital Motion Camera" label above screen.

When setting up a Windows Home Server for my growing media collection (funny how quickly your collection grows when you start archiving DVR content!) I decided to use external USB drives. After a bit of research, I decided on the MyBook Essential 500 gig unit for a couple reasons:

1.)  Reasonable price, no features that I didn't need
2.)  Attractive, minimalist design
3.)  stacks easily

I have since bought 4 of them, and plan to buy a few more. I'm very pleased... the drives have been 100% reliable despite a year of constant heavy use, and are quieter than any of the other external hard drives I own. They also generate less heat. (The other drives are Maxtor OneTouch and LaCie enclosures.)

My hair is thick, coarse, and overly frizzy--blah!!!! I was getting my hair professionally straightened at the salon. She used the 1" Farouk Chi. After 3 months of watching her do it I decided to buy my own iron and try it at home. It was amazing. I of course didn't have the time to section my hair in very small pieces as she did (took her an hour as I have a ton of hair--hence nickname: the hair of life, but it still came out pretty much the same. I would recommend to Gina (previous poster that rated it one star) to use Matrix Sleek.Look and spray each piece lightly before flat ironing. People don't understand that the iron is only as good as the spray/liquid that you decide to use with it. I have used many and the Matrix one is by far the best.
Of course after one year of use the cord finally short wired as I have heard it would--they are notorious for bad cords. I love the Chi so much that I am willing to buy a new one every year if I have to. I decided to order the Chi Turbo 1" this time with the adjustable temp control (with the red around the ends) and hate it. It doesn't close all the way and my hair gets pulled and ripped out when I am running it through. I am about to order the regular Farouk Chi 1" and use the Turbo one for back up.

Now, for someone who almost missed the horrible boat, I am happy that JINX saved me.  I got the newsletter, which came to me on the day Act 3 was released, and wondered what this Dr. Horrible thing was all about.  I went to the web site, and saw the three acts online, and watched them, when they were up for free.  I loved the songs, I loved the story.  I watched all three acts, and became close to obsessed.  I started telling friends to watch, promoting the featurette.  So, when I heard a DVD was coming, I had to get it, and placed my pre-order.  On a further note, let me break it down by parts:

The Featurette Itself

The actual Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long Blog is excellent.  The story is funny, the sets are cool, especially since it was done in some guy's house, made up by Monster House.  The songs are clever, funny, catchy, and addicting.  I thought that every actor in it was perfect for their part.  Felicia plays Penny extraordinarily, NPH IS Dr. JHorrible, and Hate was PERFECT for Captain Hammer.  Joss Whedon should take great pride in this project, and be more than satisfied with the finished product.  I can only hope that things half this good come next.

Commentary! The Musical

This was an original diea, which really caught my attention.  I watched the whole thing, not knowing what to expect.  Doing a musical commentary, about a musical, is creative, and great.  Also, it really allows a talent showcase, for those who may have been overlooked.  Stacy's "Ten Dollar Solo" is a great song, which really shows taht she has a great singing voice.  Zach's song, "Zach's Flavor," is also awesome.  I enjoyed this extra as much as the original featurette, and think this alone was worth buying the DVD.  By the way, "Ninja Ropes," is hilarious.

Filmmaker's Commentary

I usually have zero interest in hearing what the actors and writers have to say.  I made an exception, and was glad I did.  I enjoyed listening to them talk through the entire thing, and loved hearing their take on the different scenes.  Hearing all the stories, about when they were filming the scenes was hilarious, especially knowing that they did the Bad Horse chorus a few dozen times.  It shows that Nate is a good sport, considering they had him harnessed to the van for half a day.  Also, finding out this was almost done, by the Whedon's, and Maurissa, on a webcam, was an interesting piece of information.  Again, this was another worthwhile quality of the DVD.

ELE Applications

The very first application aws great, and the Zombie Princess, and puppet priest, were also great.  The others really didn't make me laugh, or hold my attention too much.  It actually disappointed me, and made me feel like I shoudl have sent in my own, and I would have, had I had the video equipment to do it.  It is still a worthwhile feature, and I congratulate those who did have their videos shown.

Final Thoughts

I definitely hope to see more of NPH, in projects like this, as I think that he fits in well.  I admit, despite her being engaged, I think, that I am officially in love with Felicia.  I'm even her friend on Facebook.  Ha-ha.  Anyway, I really do believe that every single person, who worked to make this project a reality, deserve nothing but the highest of praise.  I thank Joss Whedon for his hard work, and dedication to the business, showing that not everyone in Hollywood is just in it for the money.  So, with all of that said, I hope that anyone, who was not quite convinced to buy the DVD is now, and that you will buy it.  It is more than worth every penny, and is a very important part of my 1,000+ DVD collection.

Ok, I'm not totally ignorant when it comes to technology, but I couldn't tell you what half the stuff in these reviews means.  But I can tell you that I bought this, followed the simple step-by-step instructions (about 7 steps) using their included software, and I was using it with my laptop for wireless internet in less than 10 minutes.

So, $50, idiot-proof set-up, and all that great tech-speak that all the smart people are saying here on this board- pretty much a slam dunk in my book.

Ok, this is an awful lot to pay for making rice.  But be prepared to start throwing oatmeal at weddings after using this machine because rice will seem too good to just be throwing at people.  My house smells like nutty popcorn each time I make a batch of brown rice.  The rice has a nice sticky quality that makes using chop sticks a viable option since you can actually get mouthfuls instead of clamping one grain at a time.  If you reduce the amount of water to a little less than recommended the rice will be tender but not mealy. The timer is incredible and allows you to wake up to or come home to clean and delicious rice if that is your carbo of choice.  And it should be!

Short and Quick Review

This model is worth the 500 difference between the entry level.  The screen is beautiful, the new LED Displays are great, better color depth, more color, the laptop doesn't get as hot as previous versions.  Everything works, it is very fast, and this laptop replaced 2 high end workstations + 2 high end laptops (A dell with workstation class graphics card, and 17 inch macbook pro).  I can edit 1080p high def video in real time with no slow down, edit my 12mp raw files in real time with no slow down.  I can play the latest games like Call of Duty 4 maxed out on windows vista at native resolution with no slow down online.

With the beefy 250gb HD, ability to upgrade to 4gb of ram, the 512 graphics card, and 6mb cache, this machine is a complete replacement for me, and revolutionizes my life, work style, and workflow.

It is worth buying, and definitely better than the 2k version, by leaps, read my longer review for more.



Longer Fuller Review.

The new macbook pros are fantastic!  I had a 17 inch core 2 duo before,  it was nice, but it didn't do everything I wanted or needed.  I was forced to keep my mac pro, and my custom built windows PC for running the applications I need, and the ability to play games (I do some freelance game design, as well as photography and animation work)

I grew tired of having so many workstations, but what can you do when you need the power?  Apples new macbook pro has answered my needs.  I have wanted a laptop with a 512mb graphics card for years, it has never happened until now.

Previous to this laptop, my laptops have been "toys" the only close workstation I had was a dell that cost close to 3k, and would break your back to carry it (but it had a 512 workstation class graphics card!)  

With this laptop, I have sold my other machines, it is all I need, or want.  If it meets my needs and expectations, it should be able to meet yours easily.

The reason you buy this model, is because of the graphics card, and the increase in l2 cache on the processor.  The 2k model has less cache than last years santa rosa model (3mb compared to last years 4mb) this model and the 17 inch has 6mb, as well as the 512mb graphics card, dual core processor, and the ability to use 4gb of ram.

After getting the laptop, I use bootcamp to repartition the harddrive (did not need to reinstall OS X, was able to do this on the fly to install windows)  I split it up to give me 165gb for OS X, and the rest for windows.

I need to use specialized software that requires windows, and these programs also require very high end workstations.  The life of someone in 3d is not easy.  This workstation takes care of all my needs.  I'm running the 32 bit version of vista ultimate (the 64 bit is horrible, do not run it)  I use windows to run the programs I need (mainly zbrush, unreal engine, and 3ds max)  I can and do have maya, and can use it on this partition as well as os x thanks to the dongle, but I cannot use my creative suite software on windows, because of adobes licensees.  (though oddly enough, I can run Lightroom on both platforms)

On my OS X side, I run maya, photoshop, after effects, and final cut studio (with shake 4.1, yes I need 2 compositing programs)  I have no problems running these programs on this system.  I can render out quickly, everything is snappy.  With the 8600 geforce (opposed to ATI) maya is very responsive, and I get very few render errors.  Dynamics are able to be rendered on this machine, and I can run simulations with ease.  Render times are quite quick, and this system is very responsive.

I do photo editing, and this machine is fast as well (I upgraded to 4gb of ram myself for 95 dollars) my camera is a nikon d300,  which is 12mp,  I use lightroom and photoshop extensively, and at the same time with no problems at all.

I also run maya and photoshop cs3 together all the time (with itunes in the background).  

With leopard, I find using this machine even better.  I can use spaces, and have maya on one screen, then I can swtich to another screen with photoshop to paint textures, or reference something, and go to another screen for safari or itunes.

The touchpad is cool.  Even in windows, I can right click by using both fingers on the touch pad, and clicking with the bar, very smart apple!  it works in OS X as well (but you have to enable it)


I bought the apple keyboard (not the wireless, as I need a full size keyboard) and that keyboard is fantastic, the best I have ever owned.  I love it.  I also bought the logitech g9 mouse to use as my mouse (I cannot stand Mighty Mouse)  this mouse is perfect, and similar price.  With the wired keyboard you get use ports on the side, so you can attach the mouse to the keyboard with no problems.   And it saves on clutter.


For those who enjoy playing video games (I do help make them)  you will be happy to know you can play the latest games on PC here with great ease.  I can play call of duty 4, at native res of 1440x900 (on vista) with little to no slowdown.  Same for Unreal 3 (and all games that use this engine).  I can play Half Life 2 and Team Fortress 2 maxed out all the way, at the native screen res, with no problems at all.  I can play crysis, and bioschock (not maxed out, but pretty close).


I have not been so excited about a laptop in ages.  I had the original powerbook and used it all over, but it was slow, it was something to use when on the road, and at school.  When the first macbook pro came out, I was all over it, the software was buggy, it only allowed 2gb of ram, and it was not practical as my only system, nor was it applicable for heavy use by me.  I got the 17 inch when the core 2 duo's came out, it was great, very snappy, and with the 256 card it was close to everything I need (but only 3gb of ram)  I skipped the santa rose, as It did not really address anything.  This model addresses everything.  With 4gb of ram, 2 cores, 6mb of l2 cache, and a 512mb graphics card, there is nothing I cant do.

I edit HD video (1920x1080p) in final cut with no problems.  I composite this video in shake with 3d made in maya with NO PROBLEMS.   I play high end PC games maxed out with no problems!  (Call of Duty 4 is a hard game to run, this runs it and I can play it maxed at native res, online, with no slowdown at all).

I work on my raw images from my nikon with no problems at all.  This machine is just perfect.  Everything works the way it should, and the way it needs to.

The only complaint I have is they did not include remotes in this revision.  You can still access Front Row by using Command ESC and use that to view videos (which look very good on my HDTV).


I should also note, if you buy another keyboard (such as the apple external which I highly recommend (the wired, not wireless)  You need to go into system preferences and turn off the optiion for F Keys, as this keyboad has an FN button, like the one on the laptop, and renders using your f keys impossible without pressing fn, turning on that option, makes your keyboard normal, and you can use fn to adjust the volume of your laptop.


Right now I have this laptop hooked up to my HDTV using the supplied DVI to VGA cable, and a line out form the laptop.  I have sound on my tv (which I could pipe to a sound system if needed, or (what I do) have it piped to my wireless head phones).  This laptop is where it is at.

Please, do not think the 500 dollars for this model over the other is not worth it, as it is very much worth it.  The difference between this model, and the 2k model is night and day for me.  It goes from a toy, I can use when on the plane, to my only computer!  And that is HUGE if you are anything like me.

Now the difference between this and the 17 inch does matter.  If you get the 17 inch, you will likly not be playing the latest games at native resolution, and I plan on using this hooked up to my TV, so I do not need 2 extra inches.  If you will only be using the laptop, and have no plans on games, the 17 inch may be better for you.  After reading many reviews, the 15 inch has better response times, and everything is slightly snappier than the 17 inch, which is why I went with the 15.  There is not much a difference in size between the 2, the 17 is not much bigger than the 15, but for me, you could not get me to part with my 15 inch for anything.

This laptop is perfect, get it, and enjoy it.  The design will likely change by the next revision (rumored in june / july)  this could be the last time you can get such a beautiful laptop, that works perfectly, and is everything you can want.


5 out of 5, no problems at all.

Being recently diagnosed with high blood pressure, I can make my "fake" coffee (Teeccino Mocha with a little cream) in the morning with the k-cup device (sold separately, unfortunately, but well worth it).  And since I am no longer making a pot of coffee in the morning, my husband makes his own fresh cup using a k-cup of french roast Diedtrich coffee.  (We tried the other brands of coffee offered and this is by far our favorite.)  My kids use the hot water feature for oatmeal, top ramen noodles, and hot cocoa.  I also can drink my herbal teas during the days using the hot water feature.  

The bad news is I have to fill it up about once per day.  I am considering upgrading to the B70 which has a larger water tank but haven't reconciled the additional $50 in my head as being worth it.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)

      



I tested the Netgear WNR 2000 router on this setup:
iMac G4, system 10.4.11 (wired)
Safari 3.1.2 web browser
DSL broadband
---
iPod Touch, first generation (wireless)
PlayStation 3 (wired & wireless)
Sony Vaio laptop (wired)
Apple iBook laptop (wireless)


Setup:
*Setup and configuration on my iMac was fairly easy, even though the Netgear setup Wizard is not available for Macs. All I had to do was insert the "Start Here" CD-ROM and click on an HTML document. After that, I followed the basic step-by-step setup instructions by accessing the router through a web browser. 

*However, a key thing that made setting up the router simple was that I already had my computer configured to use a wired DSL router. Somebody setting up a router and a network for the first time might need more help, especially Mac specific help, than the CD-ROM offers.


Pros:
*The router is quite compact and doesn't have any external antennas.

*The power adapter is Energy Star certified and has a slim profile. Anybody using a plug strip will appreciate the adapter's small footprint.

*Each time the router is turned on, it automatically checks for firmware updates.

*All the critical information for running the router is printed on the back panel (MAC address, default login name and password, security PIN). The back panel also has a power on/off button, which is an unusual--and appreciated--feature for a router.

*According to the Shields Up firewall checking website (grc.com), the built-in firewall is set to complete stealth mode by default.

*Most of the instruction screens that are part of the web browser-based configuration function are clearly written and easy to understand.


Cons:
*The Ethernet ports do not support gigabit Ethernet.

*There isn't any way to change the login name used to configure the router (it is easy to change the password, however).

*It took me some trial-and-error to figure out how to restrict wireless access to the router using MAC addresses. Neither the documentation nor the web browser interface help screens were much help.

*The status lights glow either amber or green. Unfortunately, the amber color can be difficult to distinguish from the green without looking closely at the router.


Operation:
*No problems with the wired connections to my DSL modem, desktop computer, PS3, and obsolete Sony laptop.

*No problems with the wireless connections to my iPod, PS3, and an old iBook. I surfed the Web and used various web applications on the iPod and iBook. On the PS3, I did some downloads from the PlayStation Store and played Resistance 2, Pure, and Burnout Paradise online.

*I live in a densely populated area (both people and WiFi networks) and the router seems to be effective at both avoiding interference and maintaining contact with whatever is connected to it. However, I don't know how well the router would perform in a multiple story house or apartment.


Bottom line: The Netgear WNR 2000 is a good router for basic WiFi connections. If you are a Mac owner and don't feel comfortable setting things up without some handholding, you might want to consider an Apple Airport instead. Also, power users who do a lot of video streaming, connect multiple computers to WiFi, require gigabit Ethernet ports, or want an extremely strong signal with maximum range may want to consider Netgear's RangeMax routers.

We wanted to have some sort of video camera to take videos of our first baby, and upcoming travels and post short films on the internet. But it really wasn't in our budget. Then we saw The Flip, which was definitely in our price range. Since most camcorders cost $500 and up, I didn't expect all that much, despite the glitzy website. WHOA boy was I EVER impressed!!!

We decided to get The Flip Ultra, (the only version that Best Buy had in stock). The box contained the camera, a set of instructions (very small), a cable to connect it to your TV, two AA batteries, a thin slipcover, and a wrist band. The camera is only slightly bigger than my cell phone and extremely light-weight. 

I popped it open, put in the batteries, and turned it on. The time and date settings came up first, and took only a second to program in. After that, it was ready to use. I took two videos of the dog and two of the baby in his bouncer and plugged in the camera to the computer. The Flip camera didn't have to be turned on to transfer files, so that's a plus on saving battery life. When I first plugged it in, it immediately started installing some software for me (I have Windows Vista). Within just a few minutes I'd merged the two dog films and the two baby films together, made a movie card out of the baby film, and posted the dog film to YouTube. I was floored at how easy it was. An absolute idiot could use this software without any difficulty. 

There are only a few drawbacks that I could find so far. The video quality isn't spectacular, and you have to make sure you have enough light for what you are filming, but for just posting videos on he internet, the quality is just fine. Also, you are limited to only an hour of recording time, but you can easily transfer your movies to your computer to save space. The Best Buy sales rep said that the USB port that flips up tends to be rather flimsy, so we'll have to be careful with that feature, and it was a little awkward trying to plug in the USB to our laptop. Also, for some strange reason the voice of the person recording the video is far louder than the object you are recording, which is mildly annoying.  

So, if you need a cheap, little, super-easy-to-use video camera, The Flip is the way to go.

This was a great season, and I see a lot of complaints about this kind of price for such a short season. There's a reason: MANY of these episodes were a FULL HOUR, as opposed to other seasons where almost all episodes were a half hour. Compare the full running time of this set to seasons 2 and 3 and you'll see it costs less, even though it's only a bit shorter in overall length.

Very high quality product filled with amazing stories which have aged remarkably well considering the technology used back in the late 50s and early 60s. Special features are plentiful, if not somewhat bleak, as they usually consist of "Isolated Scores" from each episode, which aren't exactly riveting. Interesting subject matter none-the-less and there really is no better way to experience the Twilight Zone then curling up at night and watching a string of episodes with friends, family, or alone.

I have no experience with networking or wireless and found it fairly easy to setup.
I didnt do the automatic setup wizard.  It isnt too hard to do it manually and only took a few minutes.  Its helpful to do a little reading on wireless security and then read the applicable chapter in the manual on the CD.  After that it only takes a few minutes.  I am getting good reception all through my house and am happy with this router.

There are no printed instructions in the box.  Everything is on the CD that accompanies the router.  At least a few pages of printed instructions would have been helpful.  The instructions also push using the setup wizard very strongly. 

I am happy with my purchase.

I bought both the 54g router and card. geat products. Turned the router into an access point becasue had another router. Took a few changes to the router setup page, but works great.  I get about 24 MBPS while sitting on my toilet other side of house - lol, otherwise I get a strong signal about 50 feet away. Don't worry about the "draft" IEEE 54g standard label. Just buy the card and either access point or router and be happpy. Card worked first time I fired it up. I have A DEll.

Office 2008 for Mac Home & Student edition comes with everything that 99% of home users will need.  It includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Entourage, and Messenger for Mac.

I was using Office 2004 Student & Teacher edition and had no problems with it until I switched from a PowerPC based Mac to an Intel based Mac.  Since the 2004 version is not Universal it runs under Rosetta.  It seemed to run well, but sometimes it crashed when starting and acted finicky, like it's on the verge of crashing.  That is pretty much the only reason to upgrade from a previous version of Office Mac.  I notice that it runs and opens much more solidly, and, when scrolling through documents with the Mighty Mouse it is much, much smoother.  Other than that I don't notice much of a difference between the 2004 version and the 2008 version.  Cosmetically the programs are a little different, and some things have been moved around, but it's not a huge upgrade, and I did not find any standout new features.  The only thing worth mentioning is an "Add Worksheet" button in Excel that I find helpful.

If this is your first Office Mac purchase, and you're not a power user, it's a great suite.  Word has all the features I need for home and office usage.  I mainly send order acknowledgements with it while I'm at work, and write letters and print labels and envelopes while I'm home.  I use the mail merge feature a lot, and it works well.  Excel is a powerful spreadsheet program, and I barely use it to its full potential.  I create my home budget on it and create lists while at work.  Entourage is like Outlook for Macs.  It is an e-mail, address book, calendar, and to-do program (a life organizer).  I used to use Entourage, and while it's a good program, I now prefer to use iCal and Apple's Address Book and Mail programs.  I feel that Apple's versions are much more streamlined.  PowerPoint is a presentation program.  I've never used PowerPoint, so I can't comment on that, sorry.  Messenger is an instant messaging program, and really does not need to be included.  The version on the disc is old, and it's available online for free.

Now for the problems.... 1) If you have a lot of fonts on your Mac (my work computer has 546), and use a font management program (I use FontAgent) it takes forever (2 minutes) for any of the office programs to open when you first turn on your computer.  At home, I have a more modest number of fonts and don't have a font manager and it opens in 25 seconds.   2) It automatically installs icons for all the applications on the dock and there is no option during install to change this behavior.  It's a minor point, but it's annoying.  3) Updates, updates, updates... it's almost as bad as iTunes.  Since installing it a month ago I've had about 5 updates some of which were over 100 MB.  4) The extension for a Word document is now. docx so all your old Word documents have to be saved in the new format or they run in "compatibility mode" which caused some of my old documents to not be formatted correctly.

All in all... If you're new to Macs, or Office for Mac, it's a good purchase.  If you own an older version of Office Mac, and you're running it on a PowerPC Mac, don't bother.

I am technically 5-star happy with this thing, but I gave it 4 stars for the same reason almost everyone else is... The wireless-N hiccup. Its a matter of principle.

Im fine with the connectivity I get with 2.4ghz N. Its faster than any wireless device Ive ever owned. Its also my understanding that most other netbooks only offer 2.4ghz N if at all. Whats annoying is that the wireless adaptor drivers give you the ability to attempt to configure it for 5ghz N... It just doesnt seem to be working for anyone. Im not sure if Asus has actually claimed that the 5ghz N specifically was functional but I had assumed that they did. Someone could correct me there...

I have read in reviews that it should play 720p video with no problems but I have not tried any 720p video except for an x.264 video in an mkv that I tried to play with VLC player. It was not watchable. I understand that this is a bit more intensive than other formats in 720p but its the kind I typically use with my home theater so I had to try. *shrug* Also note I have not yet upgraded to the 2gb stick of ram but plan to.

Whatever... as I stated above I am really happy with it and might buy another one. 

EDIT: you can google some forums of eeepcuser(s) etc and see a number of threads where people have easily and successful installed true dual band cards. its almost as simple as replacing the ram. if this was the only deal-breaker for you not buying just know you can easily do it for 2[...]

as for the battery life i dont think i could or would ever get 9.5hrs out of it. you would have to disable WLAN/camera/bluetooth and turn the LCD brightness all the way down and you might get close. still i get about 8hrs out of it and thats way more than anything else ive seen near this price.


EDIT II: did amazon change the description on this thing? i swear it didnt use to indicate that it was 'N 2.4ghz only' but if it did then i guess i kinda owe it the 5 stars. i only gave it four stars because i felt like it was partially misrepresented.

This is such a great product. I have a 9 month old maltese and he sleeps in the bed with me. I originally wanted a set of stairs so that he can get off and on the bed without me picking him up. This product solved the problem. My dog has had no problem getting off and on the bed. I also like the fact that you can store it under the bed when you dont need it.

I dieted for about a month with very meager results. 1200 calories a day, and I lost only about 1.5 pounds per week.

When I started the Alli pills my weight loss more than doubled. It has slightly tapered off over time, but it's obviously had a dramatic effect and I have lost about 25 pounds surprisngly quickly.

I still eat fatty meals at times (15 grams of fat per meal is recommended but I find this too restrictive), yet the side effects are still pretty minor. When I eat lower fat meals they are nonexistant. They also seem to descrease over time.

I love this juicer.  I have wanted to get back into juicing for a while, but hated the thought of cutting fruit and vegetables; not to mention the annoying clean-up. (I used to own a Juiceman) With this juicer I can put whole (small) apples in it.  The only thing I've had to cut is large pears. The clean up is super easy and fast too.  It comes with a brush, which cleans the mesh basket, but the handle of the brush doubles as a spatula to scoop out the pulp.  I highly recommend it!

My small (17 lb) dog enjoys rolling his Tricky Treats ball around the floor while I do my ab crunches.  It's our morning-time workout routine together.

He noses and paws the ball around until the (small bite) dog kibble dispenses, one or a few at a time.  So, what he could scarf down from a bowl in 45 seconds takes him about 5 minutes to extract.

The non-rigid plastic makes for a relatively gentle noise, compared to some other treat toys that really clatter.

Recommendation:  Use dry food only, to keep the ball clean and avoid the need to wash.

Easy to set up and functions well.  Several have already mentioned the akwardness of the shift key location, but I've gotten used to it.  It does get warm quickly, but so far, no troubles due to the heat.  It's not the slickest looking netbook, but as long as it works well, I don't mind.  I bought a new Netgear wireless router and had trouble setting that up, but Netgear's technical support walked me through a manual setup and everything is functioning smoothly. I picked this model because it has the internal memory that others don't.  I do recommend this product and very happy with it so far.

This is my second WGR614 (my first one is a v6).  The new wireless will replace an outdated Netgear MR814 wireless firewall which is configured as an access point on my wired network.

I've had excellent uptime availability from the v6 version of this product and hope the same is true of the current version; however, it will be configured as an AP on my wired network replacing the MR814 (so I won't be using the firewall and WAN features of my second WGR614).

I had the Sonicare Elite from 5 years ago, and its battery ran out (they're not replacable). I got the FlexCare and absolutely love it. It's a little quieter, quite a bit smaller, and *much* easier to clean.  I use the UV cleaning but don't know if it's really useful.  I've used the various modes (normal, max, massage, etc.) but don't think they're that important.  If they come out with a lower-end model without all the various modes, the UV cleaner, etc., at a much lower price, I'd recommend that over this model.  Still, over 5 years, the price of this model isn't too much to spend on your teeth.

The Salton YM9 1-Quart Yogurt Maker was on my Wish List for over a year.  My family finally got the hint and ordered it for my birthday, along with the Cuisipro Donvier Yogurt Cheese Maker, and the The Book Of Yogurt by Sonia Uvezian.  

I have been making a quart of fresh, homemade yogurt a week since I got these items and I am very pleased with the outcome.  The Salton "incubator" is easy to use; my only problem with the design is the slot and channel for the included spoon (which you don't really need) makes cleanup a little more time consuming.  The unit includes a brief instruction guide which was simple to follow and was sufficient to get me up and running.  Where Salton suggests a candy or deep-frying thermometer, I've been having great success with a Taylor digital readout "chef's" stem-type thermometer.  It was under $15.00 and very accurate for yougurt making.  Many home cooks already have one in their kitchen anyway.

The Cheese Maker is basically a high-quality stainless steel mesh strainer suspended in a heavy-duty plastic container with a tight-fitting lid.  When a batch of yougurt is complete, spoon up to 1 cup of it into this device, and place it in the fridge for several hours or overnight.  The result is a thick, creamy "cheese", the consistency of sour cream or even whipped cream cheese.  Since I use fat-free milk to make the yogurt, the cheese is a great, guilt-free substitute for cream cheese, and can substitute for it in almost any recipe.  In the Donvier booklet is a recipe for a yogurt cheesecake I'm just dying to try!  Although the same results can be obtained by using a cheesecloth-lined strainer over a bowl, the Donvier unit takes up less space in the refrigerator and is fairly easy to clean.

The Book Of Yogurt by Sonia Uvezian contains many international recipes from every food category, as well as basic instructions for yogurt making that embellish what comes with the yogurt maker itself.  I've tried a few, and they are wonderful.

I've never owned an ice cream maker before, but have considered buying one for a number of years now. To be honest, I didn't have the nostalgia for homemade ice cream that many people have. Every batch of homemade ice cream I'd ever eaten had an unpleasantly graininess to it. But there were so many recipes I wanted to try . . . Still, if I was going to bother to dish out $50 for an ice cream maker and spend more on ingredients than I'd pay for a pre-packaged carton, that ice cream had better be perfectly smooth! 

A trial run on a borrowed ice cream maker and the fabulous chocolate ice cream that resulted at last convinced me that good texture was possible. So I finally took the leap. Flash forward to the arrival of my cute little red Cuisinart machine, and my first very own batch of homemade ice cream, prepared with a thoroughly chilled custard--an essential, I'd read, for ideal texture, and a technique that had proved its worth in my trial run. I chose a lovely recipe for malted milk chocolate ice cream from Lory Brody's Chocolate American Style, including the optional chopped malted milk balls. The ice cream turned out perfectly, in terms of both flavor and texture: smooth, creamy, and with just enough air to give it a pleasant lightness. Now I'm looking forward to many more happy batches of quality homemade ice cream with my Cuisinart!

The Flip Video MinoHD Camcorder is the ideal choice if you need a unit that offers HD functionality with the simplest possible interface.  This model sets itself apart from standard format compact camcorders with the highly sought after feature of 720p HD video capture.  

Video quality was already very good with the Flip Mino, and the Mino HD is even better.  The internal storage has been doubled to 4 GB, but for the purposes of HD video that still only yields 60 minutes of recording.  So at its highest setting of 720p, you can save about an hour's worth of video.  But the battery will last long enough for you to record for much longer than that as you selectively delete the clips you don't need.  

The use of the standard mp4 video also makes it easy to play recordings on your computer or TV, but if you need to edit this video with software other than what is included make sure it supports HD video editing.

PROS
+ Video quality is greatly improved on the Mino HD, offering 720p HD Video
+ Improved 4 GB internal storage captures an hour of HD video 
+ Uses standard format MP4 (mpeg4) files
+ Includes a port and cable for AV connections to TVs 
+ The Mino HD has simple on-screen menus and good software 
+ The battery seems to hold its charge well
+ A standard tri-pod screw hole is included on the bottom 
+ The USB connector tucks neatly into the body like on the original Mino  
+ Has a sleek body with a shiny black surface 
+ The microphone sensitivity is good enough for close recording 
+ The built-in speakers on the Mino are good for playback
+ Low light performance is also slightly improved
+ Includes a pouch and a dongle for storage and transport  
+ Nice front light indicates when unit is recording
+ The screen is adequate given the sharper resolution
+ The unit is very light, portable and easy to carry

CONS
- High price due to the HD feature approaches full featured units
- The 16:9 format plays great on widescreen TVs, but you may have to adjust full-screen HD TVs
- Still only 2X zoom, making it ideal for up close use
- Mino HD uses a built-in rechargeable battery that is not user changeable
- The included software requires a lot of RAM to run 
- Does not include a jack for a compact microphone - sometimes needed for work use 
- No headphone jack for checking audio playback
- Screen can't be seen when recording from high or low vantage points
- The Mino HD won't let you adjust video quality to record for longer 
- Software issues are intermittent but noticeable
- Mac users may find it easier to drag and drop files than run the software
- No memory card slot limits recording time

THE COMPETITION

The price of the original Flip Mino has not dropped since the Mino HD came out.  It should fall with time. Those who don't need HD may still choose one of the conventional options, including the Flip Mino, Creative Labs Vado and the original Flip Ultra.  While the Flip Mino was slightly better than the other two, an argument could have been made for any of them.  The Creative Vado is probably the best value and will meet most people's needs at half the price.  

The Sanyo Xacti VPC-CG9 offers HQ video recording at a similar price to this unit but with more features and SD memory storage.  Most point and shoot cameras will also capture standard video, but are generally not as comfortable to operate.

The Mino HD offers 720p video in a more compact size than competing devices.  So those looking for HD and simple operation should choose it.  Some will need HD with more features and many will want more than one hour of recording.  The Sanyo Xacti HD700 is in the ballpark in terms of price and offers HD with many of the features missing from the Mino HD.  

Demanding users may need models like the Sanyo Xacti HD1010 and Canon VIXIA HF10.  Each offers more features and expandable storage via memory cards.  Of course those are also expensive (at around 3X the price) and much more complex to operate.  Hopefully the prices of higher end units will come down.  No matter what your needs, many more options are being released this fall.  

CONCLUSION

The Mino HD really wins on convenience and is a nice quality item to gift to somebody who is not super tech savvy.  This is basically a point and click HD camcorder, and in that sense it's one of a kind.  It's good enough to warrant the premium price.  If you need more features, look into the higher end models.
 
Enjoy!

This is a great pedometer, well worth the extra cost.  I used to have a cheaper pedometer and it only counted about 60% of my steps.  This pedometer is pretty much right on the money. I love that you can just put it your shirt pocket or belt.  I've actually found the best place for it, if you're wearing jeans, is in the little watch pocket part. You hardly notice it's there.  I also haven't had a problem with it falling off and hitting the ground as I've seen mentioned in other reviews.  They may have improved the product since those reviews were written...it has a nice "leash" on it so that even if this clip doesn't do it's job it's still attached to you and doesn't fall down.

I want to start out by saying that Im not an expert on these things by any means.  But I do my fair share of "playing" with computers.  I was looking for a laptop for use with my photography and of course was looking at getting the 18.4" monitor with the truck battery weight.  Man was I surprised when I looked at them!  They are Enormous!  And incredibly heavy.  I rethought my plan and decided to go with a smaller computer and ...well....lets just say I bought this one.
  I really like it so far.  The keys are fine for me and the screen is bright and sharp.  I havent found anything that I dont like as of yet except that I can't find an internet security suite that works with 64 bit Vista yet.
  I got 4 gigs and will upgrade to 8 in the future.  The hard drive is big enough for me as I dont keep everything in here anyways. I like the weight distribution as well. The battery does stick out a bit in the back but it doesnt affect the handling now.  It does take a bit of getting used to. It has many of the features that the full sized models have so I am impressed.  The price is right as well.  Enjoy it.

Despite all the other reviews. I will give you my full honest review.
I read all the other ones about people complaining how this little thing was NOT that great. I have to differ. This thing does exactly what its suppose to do. I've been using this thing for about 1 month now and its great. Its alot smaller than i had pictured it but it makes just enough rice for a family of 3. It makes perfect white rice every time. i have not tried any other rice beside the white rice. Never had any spilling of liquid or burnt rice. Overall, as long as you read the correct measurements. everything will turn out perfect everytime! I would definately purchase this model again.

Well, I ordered this product, as my dog had to be musseled and it still took two people to clip his nails.  It was tramatic for everyone. My dog is part yorkie, and part weinner dog.  He is about 2 years old.  Cutting his nails was always a problem.  I can now do his back paws without any problems, but he is still very protective of his front paws being done.  The product works very well. It is also quicker to complete the task then it was with the nail clippers.  He tries to bite the pedi paws instead of me now, once in awhile.  I am hoping with additional exposure to the pediPaws that his anxiety will continue to decline.

This is an amazing product.  The ease of use and the power of the engine make it a fabulous addition to the kitchen gadgetry.  I like the color as it helps make any flour stand out - and so easy to clean.

Works very well, better than I expected actually.  I had read other reviews describing it as "very loud", but I don't think it is very bad at all.  The more often I am using it, the better the shave.  I would definately recommend it.

I love this yogurt maker.  I use non-fat milk along with non-fat dry milk.  I add 2 tablespoons of agave with 2 teaspoons of fructose after I have heated the milk.  When cooled I add vanilla (paste or powder) before adding the starter.  I read some great information on some of the food blogs that suggested using a wide-mouth glass canning jar with a plastic lid in place of the plastic container that comes with the Salton Yogurt Maker.  The lids can be purchased in the canning section of Walmart.  That way I don't have to wait until I have used a batch of yogurt before making the next batch.  It really is the creamiest, best tasting yogurt with wonderful consistency.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)

      



I've used Crest Whitestrips for years.  I've always been a fan and even prefer them to the one-hour Brite Smile professional treatment, which I've done twice before.

These are the best Whitestrips I've used.  The 30-minutes, once per day for 14 day schedule is superior to the twice per day schedule of other versions, in my opinion.  Importantly, the product does indeed seal over your teeth very nicely making it possible to have a conversation while using the product.  

The result was also excellent, with nice whiteness and a uniform bright appearance.  I just saw my dentist last week and he said, "Your teeth look beautiful", which is a direct quote.  While he also sells more expensive professional treatments, he said that he thinks that Crest makes an excellent product.

My recommendation is 5 stars all the way.  This item is highly recommended!

I have used several pedometers in the past with no luck.  They would either over-estimate or under-estimate.  This pedometer doesn't do that. It is exactly on the money.  I did about 5 test counting my steps to see was the pedometer correct.  It was correct every time.  I love the extra clip. You can clip it to your pants/skirt and then attact the security clip to a belt loop etc.  I have had it fall off of me twice (belt clip and all)when I was picking up something heavy. But both times it just dangled by the security clip.  So far it has not just fell out of the belt clip by  iteself.  The software is great. It tracks steps by the hour. You can also set goals for yourself.  Overall this pedometer is good for the price and great for beginners/imntermediate walkers.

This is simply the best dog brush I have ever used. I have a 15-year-old chow mix who has a very thick undercoat. I could tell after one stroke that this was different than any I've ever used. It cut my grooming time in half, and my dog looked like she had just come from the groomers. It works great on my cats too. It removes an incredible amount of hair. You will want to use it outdoors. Wear old clothes and bring a bag, cause the amount of hair it easily removes is just incredible. Hair that used to end up on my carpet or elsewhere in the house. The Furminator is well worth every penny.

I've only had this scale for about a week and so far it's been good. It was very easy to set it up for my husband and I to each use. My weight has been consistent throughout the week, although my % body fat keeps drastically changing (and my % body fat could not have doubled in a few hours and then gone back down so quickly)...maybe it's water or something. The BMI has also remained consistent. Overall I like the scale very much, it works well and looks nice. I think it's a great deal for the money.

The connection is great. I have the router upstairs and have no problem with the signal on the lower level. The installation did not go smoothly. I did end up having to work with a linksys rep. The first one was clueless but when I called back, I got one who really stuck with it until we finally got it. Be prepared to dedicate an hour and a half to trouble shoot. Wasn't pleasant. Hope my problem was isolated but beware.

I was hesitant to spend almost $20 on a brush for my short-haired-but-ever-so-shedding kitty.  I've tried all sorts of different types of cat brushes, but none have even come close to how well the Furminator works!  My kitty has gone from a shedding machine, even with hours of weekly brushing, to a well groomed beast.  It's a little harsher on his skin then other brushes, but he doesn't seem to mind.  It is definitely worth the investment!

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)

      



With "Twilight", Stephenie Meyer pronounced herself a writer to be reckoned with, a writer who could forge an interesting new twist on a very old legend.  With "New Moon", the second book of the Twilight saga, Meyer proves that she deserves the acclaim and recognition that have aaccompanied this series.  It also winds up making readers even more anxious to know how the story of Bella Swan and her vampire love will turn out.

Picking up where "Twilight" left off, the second novel begins with Bella reluctantly celebrating her eighteenth birthday - reluctantly because she desires to become a vampire like Edward and doesn't want to be older than his immortal seventeen.  Yet Bella gets the exact opposite of her wish, when her birthday celebration goes disastrously wrong, and Edward concludes that Bella would be safest if he were to leave town - permanently.  After the Cullens leave, Bella is adrift, lost in her own melancholy, until awakened through the elicit promise of danger.  She renews her friendship with Jacob Black, the Quilete Indian who soon learns that he has a frightening secret of his own that just might threaten their newly forged bond.

"New Moon", despite its near six-hundred pages, is fast-paced and draws the reader in immediately.  Yet the story falters at times, through a small lack of suspense in regards to the relationship between Bella and Edward.  Jacob's secret is easy to guess, and not necessarily a new twist, but one that works well and signifies some rather interesting and aggonizing times ahead.  I must admit that the scenes with the creepy Volturi family (the oldest vampire family in existence) are rather good, even if they owe a little bit to Anne Rice.  Stephenie Meyer deftly manages to weave a love story sheltered within the walls of vampire legends, but furthermore, manages to make it seem as if it could actually happen.  As if these creatures from myths and legends actually walked among us.

In a number of circles, the iPod Classic is now considered the "less sexy" iPod. Largely because of the things it appears to lack vis-a-vis the newest "fully-wired" iPods/iPhones: it doesn't have a phone function (d'oh!), it doesn't "do" wide-screen for video and games the way an iPhone/iPod Touch does, and...well, it doesn't seem as much *fun*, darn it! (Memo to the only-two-colors-available fashionistas: silver and [charcoal] black, being *classic* colors, go with everything. When's the last time you saw a pink Audi or Merc? Mary Kay doesn't hand either of those out to its top sales stars, which is just as well.) ;-)

Let's rewind a bit (sorry for the tape-based analogy) to a MacWorld seemingly long, long ago.

At the time, people were clamoring for Apple to include video in their next-generation iPods (they had just announced the iPod Photo, which was the very first iPod I ever owned...sometimes, not being an "early adopter' can pay off). His Steveness replied, more or less, that people value music a lot more than than they value TV/video stuff, so for the time being, no video iPods. While I happened to agree with Jobs' sentiments (I rarely watch the box, so there), I also knew how shrewd a businessman he was, and if the Hoi Polloi wanted video in their iPods, by cracky, he'd make 'em! And while I wouldn't damn him to Hades for such a pragmatic decision (he's doing this stuff to make a buck, okay?), the aesthete in me would be put off just a bit. That was then.

NOW: Through a bit of hard work and happenstance, an iPod Classic (120GB) happened to fall into my lap recently (long story). My beloved 60GB iPod Photo wasn't even half-full, but I welcomed this newest 'Pod with open arms. The reasons?

- Capacity. Let the deniers who bought their iPhones, Touches, and nanos prattle on; if you're a serious music lover, you've got a ton of music on the home front, and, if you're Of A Certain Age, probably in more than one format: CD, LP cassette, and, if you're particularly well-preserved, you might even have a few commercially-produced open-reel tapes lurking about.  Paying upwards of $400 or so for the "biggest" iPod Touch might be a bit of a stretch for you...am I right? You might not even give a rat's tuchus (it's okay to say that here, right?) about video and gaming capability, but you'll really care about capacity. Are we grokking here?

Good. Because this iPod, even this late in the game, is aimed toward you and me. Apple, now the 900lb gorilla of the portable digital-media market (how strange that must be to Mssrs Gates & Ballmer) has the market covered: you want a device that's all-singing, all-dancing? You can get an iPhone, or, short of that, an iPod Touch. If it's got to be as tiny as possible (I won't ask why...), there's the nano, or, if it really has to be much smaller, the lovely 2nd-Gen Shuffle (which my Significant Other managed to lose shortly after I presented one to her as a gift; she'll inherit my iPod Photo now).

- True Gapless Playback. The iPod Photo had just one glaring flaw: any album by a group that had a thing for track-into-track segues (say, XTC, the Beatles, Pink Floyd...you get the idea) didn't translate at all with the Photo; you'd get an abrupt track change instead of the smooth, proper transition the band and engineers intended. I know the iPod Generation kicked off the "rip/mix/burn-it-like-you-wanna" thing, but if I want to hear the damn album the way it was released, then I should be able to. In the iPod world, this possibility didn't materialize until the 5th Gen iPod (video). Now that I have the newest Classic, I really, really appreciate this.

- The Sound. Most talk about getting good sound from an iPod is almost entirely focused on headphones, usually fairly pricey ones. But, to use a high-end audio mantra, you only get out what you put in. Sometime around the introduction of the first iPod Classic, Apple quietly made some serious engineering changes in the output section of the iPod, resulting in both a reduced noise floor and improved detail. One online review stated that the new design appeared to be ever-so-slightly less "warm" sounding than the previous design, but between the lowered noise floor and improved musical detail the new design was a solid net gain. I concur: subjectively, the Classic's overall sound might sound a tad less "euphonic" than my iPod Photo, but I also notice better transient detail and handling of low, delicate notes with both my semi-isolating, against-the-ear Sennheiser PMX200 headphones and my Sony MDR-EX85LP in-ear 'phones. Somehow this seems to have at least a slight effect on line output, too: playback through the living-room hi-fi (via a Griffin AirDock, also a screaming bargain at its current price) offers similar, but not quite as obvious improvements over the iPod Photo. This isn't a case of bad versus good: this is good versus Mighty Good.

- The Classic is, as close as can be, a direct descendant of the original iPod that turned the portable digital music-player market on its ear. The enhancements it has picked up since then have made sense insomuch as they haven't gotten much in the way of the Prime Directive, if you will: allowing the user to carry and access her/his music collection about easily, and with reasonable fidelity. No, it was never a direct replacement for a killer home 'fi (which most people don't possess), but more than ear-pleasing in the environs in which these devices are most-often used. (Yes, as a New Yorker, the subway comes to mind most often...particularly the F, A, C, and #2/3 lines.)

- While I do admit that the iPhone/iPod Touch interface is mad-cool and industry-leading, I still believe the Click Wheel more than holds its own in terms of overall ergonomics; as has been pointed out in a few other reviews here, it's still the only interface you can manage one-handed, and which allows you to navigate between music tracks without looking at the unit (why isn't THIS the iPod "Touch?"). Like the 5G iPod, you get video, which for the most part I couldn't care less about (although I can now view the video portion of my iTunes purchase of The Traveling Wilburys Collection, which is sort of nice). The notion of watching music videos, let alone feature-length movies, on a not-even-three-inch screen, when we're being assaulted with the idea that a 32" screen at home is woefully inadequate, 'specially if it ain't high-def, is a bit inconsistent.

But, this is about music, music you can take with you.

By this lone standard, the iPod Classic clearly blows everything else Apple offers into the weeds. Anything not made by Apple, IMO, hasn't even found its way to the starting line. The interface is highly functional and sexy enough, without allowing surface to roll straight over substance.

The happy thing is that Apple offers options to fit just about anyone. If you need a single do-it-all device, and don't care (at least at the moment) about capacity for all your fave tracks, you've got either the iPhone 3G or iPod Touch; if you want your device as tiny and unobtrusive as possible, you've got either the Shuffle or the polychromatic nano. And, finally, if, like me, you want, over all else, as much of your music at hand, wherever you are, as your balm, your salve, your relief from waiting-room Hell or airport Purgatory, the Classic is really it. And, for what it's worth, the current (120GB) Classic wil be able to use the newest Apple earbuds with in-line remote control and microphone (they've got a twin-driver 'phone "coming soon" that promises to be grand-sounding; we'll see). If you haven't checked out any 'Pods since the Photo or before, this is likely the one to finally pop for.

I grew up on Transformers and was hoping that Michael Bay just did not destroy it. Anyway, my kids mouth was open the entire movie, and it was just a fun movie. Yes, I was young enough to almot cry when Optimus died in the cartoon movie, so I was a kid that was indoctrinated into this world. Anyway adult now, and liked this movie, it was fun. It got a little weak towards the end, but still was good and had me waiting to go to the bathroom, so not miss anything. It was worth the money of admission, cool, not "Gone with Wind", type movie, a fun, loud movie.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)

      



In 'Twilight' Stephenie Meyer showed us just how original and interesting the vampire story can be -- in 'New Moon' she does it again, but with werewolves. 

'New Moon' continues the story Meyer began in 'Twilight' with Isabella Swan and Edward Cullen just really starting to explore the love they discovered in the first book...when Edward suddenly decides he needs to leave. He leaves Forks, and leaves Bella with little clue as to why he's gone and no hope that he will return. Bella, as a result, dives into a deep hole that nobody can fill.

Eventually she reconnects with her father, her friends, and particularly with Jacob, a young boy from the Quileute tribe that she met in the first book. She forms a friendship with Jacob that comforts her...and then she finds out that Jacob has a secret of his own. He, and many of the other boys in the Quileute tribe, are actually werewolves.

As in 'Twilight,' Meyer's take on werewolf legend both incorporates commonly-held beliefs about them, and gives them an original spin. And, again like the first book, Meyer's mythological creatures are not monsters, but real characters with depth and feeling and an edge of reality and vulnerability that gives the story the extra dimension.  This is what makes the story so good -- the original take on the legends is a nice touch, but it is the characters and the way Meyer treats them that makes it truly special.

Though 'New Moon' isn't quite as purely hopeful as 'Twilight' was, its characters are every bit as believable, it is every bit as original, and in the end, it is every bit as good a book.  Read it and see for yourself.

This is the second FURminator I've purchased.  We lost the first one when our RV was totaled and couldn't find it in the rubble.  I paid almost $50+ in a retail store for the first one...you can't beat the price on Amazon.

I bought the large size because we have 2 labs but it works fine with our 2 cats also (all are inside pets).  I would suggest using the tool outdoors because there is so much loose hair when combing.  I would recommend this item for purchase.  The FURminator really cuts down on the shedding.  You can go to their website and see photos of how well it works.

Wall-e is a trash compacting robot left on earth to clean up after the planet becomes uninhabitable by humans.  Then he meets EVE a highly advanced robot.  He follows her to outerspace, where mankind is living on a spaceship awaiting the clean-up of earth...700 years in the future.

I thought the movie was a little slow, not much really goes on in the begining...its just walle rolling around.  But my 5 year old can't get enough of it.  i've never seen him so entranced by a movie, he cheers when they win at the end, he gets upset when walle gets hurts.  i gave it 4 stars because i was expecting better from pixar, but they have set the bar a little high for themselves (monsters inc, the incredibles etc...)  I highly recommend it for younger audiences.

I LOVE MY OMRON PEDOMETER!!

Three weeks before purchasing my Omron HJ-112 Digital Pedometer, a group of coworkers decided to lose weight over a 20-week period. My weight and cholesterol had been climbing, so I decided to join. I don't have a lot of time to exercise at a gym, so I decided to try walking as much as I could. One of our weight group purchased the pedometer from Amazon and recommedned it to me.

Since purchasing my pedometer, my walking, (and jogging in place in front of the TV each night), has increased by leaps and bounds!! The calorie and mileage counters have greatly added to my committment to walk. I have lost 1 or 3 pounds each week since my purchase, and I attribute this success to my pedomter!  I can visually see how many calories I am burning, so it makes me want to walk more to burn more calories! It was well worth the 25.00 (item price + shipping). I even pursuaded another coworker to purchase one!!!

THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

I have think wavy hair, with some corse curly bits at the bottom. I tried Conair and Babyliss, among other, before, but none of them have worked as well as the CHI. I've been using this product for almost two years, and I'm still 100% satisfied. If only takes me 15 minutes to straighten my hair and with other products it took approx. 30 mins.
Some days it may take a lttle longer than 15 mins, but that's rare. 
I used it friends who have tight cruls and it worked wonders. 
It really does save time and I rarely need to touch it up. Usually I can go until my hair needs to be washed without touching it up. 
Personally, I feel that sometimes the shampoo and conditioner you use affects the way your hair straightens (with any flat iron). For my hair fructus works best, and its the worst with pantene Pro V. So if you figure out whats good for your hair, you should have no problems with the CHI. 
You may want to use mosturizing treatments for addded shine and silkiness, but I find that the CHI makes your look shiny and feel so smooth.  
This is the best straightening product I have ever used, I don't even find a need to put serum.

There's a heck of a lot of technical reviews out there and this won't be yet another. This is from the perspective of a mom who loves to capture clips of her child at any moment.

First... the size of the Kodak Zi6 makes it fit perfectly into a purse or a baggy pocket, making it a breeze to just pull out and start shooting immediately.

Second... the quality of the video is awesome compared to the really very good true "video" camera I was using.

Third... It's so easy to use. You turn it on and you hit record! What more could you want?

Fourth... It's so cute! What girl wouldn't love a little pink Zi6?

Fifth... Price. You can't beat it. Sure the similar camera made by Creative produces an even better picture but it's also about $100 more than the Zi6. If you're wanting to spend around $150... this is the HD handheld camera to get.

The only reason I didn't give this camera 5 stars is because there is little to no image stabilization. So, if you tend to have a shaky hand, you will probably notice a good bit of shake in your resulting video. But, that said, every video camera I've used that did have image stabilization also sacrificed a bit of quality to provide it. I'd take quality over losing the little bits of shake I see any day.

Everyone says the camera does poor in low lighting but from my experiences so far, it's giving a true picture. If you're in a room with low light, guess what? The video will have low lighting. Seems common sense. Still, it doesn't get grainy which is something I have experienced on so many occasions with an "old fashioned" video camera in such a situation.

All in all... best gift I've received in a long long time. I love this little thing.

This is a great way to trim your beard. A definite step up from traditional trimmers. The magic in it is the vacuum that captures and stores trimmed beard and mustache hair instead of letting it fall into your sink to make a mess. You don't make your lady mad, and everyone is happy.

The trimmer itself fits comfortably in your hand. It has an detachable cord that allows the unit to be charged. It can operate on the cord or off it's batteries for cordless use. The trimmer is NOT submersible.

The attached guard can be adjusted to 9 length settings with a rotating selector. It can also be taken off for trimming necklines or other areas. There is also a separate smaller attachment that can be used for precision cuts.

The vacuum is power and made more powerful over earlier models through the use of the "Turbo" button that amps up the cutting power and vacuum power substantially.  When you are done cutting your hairs are captured in a removable tray for disposal. There are still a few hairs that don't get sucked up but it a huge improvement over using trimmers without suction.

The only negatives are that the hair capture cup is a tad small. There is also a plastic piece that guides hair into the cup that makes neck and cheek-line trimming a little tricky until you get the hang of it.

Overall a great trimmer for those of us real men with beards. A must have!!

This box works great. It's less expensive than the motorized boxes and easier to clean than a regular box. The concept is simple. Inside the box is a grate. When you roll the box over, the litter falls through the holes in the grate leaving only the clumps. When you roll the box back, the litter falls back into the bottom of the box and the clumps go into the drawer. You remove the drawer and dump it.

Hooked on Breville...I was able to find the Ikon juicer for $175 shipped...not a bad price for this great item. Realistically, this machine operates  almost identically to the $50 Hamilton-Beach "Big-Mouth"...the difference being: the Ikon is quieter, multi-speed, build quality and materials are improved and it just looks like a high dollar, state of the art...juicer sitting on the counter. It's also a nice match for the K-cup Breville coffee maker, ($210,Linens'n Things closeout)and a Breville Panini grill, ($42,a sale at Williams Sonoma factory store). These are all great functioning and beautifully made products...try them , enjoy them.

I've strained yogurt for years using cheesecloth or a paper towel in a colander; this method is much cleaner and allows you to let the yogurt drain in the refrigerator which is a huge plus.  With a lid over it, you can ward off any ambient refrigerator odors while your cheese is coming together.  The only complaint I have is that the item is too small to hold a full 32 oz. container of yogurt.  Otherwise it's a handy item!

There's not as much dandruff and his coat is shinier. I'm sure it will also reduce the amount of fur balls for our smaller female cat. I would not hesitate to buy and the price is great on Amazon. I paid more at a local pet store.

Outstanding !!! No other word can explain this coffee maker period! No more wasted coffee sitting in the pot. Now I can have my decaf, my wife can have her french roast, one daughter can have her hazelnut blend, and my other daughter can enjoy a vanilla flavored coffee. This brewer is simple to use with no mess. You will not be disappointed with the B60. Buying the k-cups in bulk is the only way to go! Brewing coffee using k-cups and the Keurig B60 may cost a few  more cents per cup than a pot of store bought canned coffee but it is much cheaper than "Dunk your doughnuts". Enjoy!!!

I read some articles about how slow the Kingston DataTraveler 8GB was. It works fast enough for me on my MacBook. It was recognized instantly and I copied 600MB to it, through a USB even, and it only took 2 minutes. I am glad that it does not have a lanyard--I alway throw them away. Kingston, once again, came through with a great product.

If you take this for the entertainment value and NOT historical accuracy, you won't be disappointed. This is entertainment, loosely based on history. It's very well done on a grand scale and even though you *know* how certain events unfold, you will still find yourself waiting for Henry to step in at the last minute and stop them.

Why I didn't have a Kitchen Aid mixer before I'll never know.  I love this machine.  It makes making a cake a pure pleasure.  No more creaming butter and suger for 30 minutes - now it takes me 10 minutes tops.  Making bread is fast and easy also.  This is the best thing I've ever bought for my kitchen.

My husband and I decided to buy this for a mutual Valentines day present this year and I couldn't be happier! A slight and easy adjustment gets the bottom dry bits (as some have complained about) and mine is very very quiet.

I have never had an experience with a stand mixer before- my grandmother uses a fork, my mom uses hand mixers- I had a hand mixer for years. I finally blew the motor on my 4th hand mixer last christmas (2 in the same holiday!) and we decided to just buy the stand mixer. My eggs are fluffy- my whipped cream is light and airy- my cookies are well mixed. You can leave it going for as long as you like while you get ingredients and put them in, and it's so quiet you can watch TV with it on in the next room.

Plus- with a mixer in fire engine red... It makes me smile every time I walk into the kitchen and see it!

I was sad when my little girl outgrew the last size (size 2) available in Swaddlers and purchased both Huggies and Pampers for her.  The Huggies leaked out of the inside leg seam every single time, so I tried Pampers - both Baby Dry and the Cruisers.  Although neither leaked, the Cruisers seemed much easier for her to move around in and the fit is amazing.
You can tell pampers has done their baby-research!!  Thank you!

I recently bought a KitchenAid food processor. Haven't used it for dough, but have used the small bowl for a couple of things, and didn't find that it got the big bowl dirty - may depend on what you're making.
Found that it has plenty of power, and yet stays put on the countertop, unlike those I have seen on TV that have to be held in place.
I did quite a bit of research before my purchase, all the recommendations I found said to buy KitchenAid. I ended up with the one that America's Test Kitchen liked and am very happy with my choice.

I purchased this router as a replacement for a faulty Vonage wireless router.  Long story short, this device in combination with a new Vonage device totally fixed the problems with my phone.

This router was easy to install and took only about 5 minutes to get my wireless devices (a Wii and a laptop) up and running.  I am not a computer repair person, though I'm pretty comfortable with electronic device setup and for me there were no problems at all.  I've had the router over a month and am 100% satisfied.

Anything that you could do thanks to the internet is now made available to you at the swipe of your sophisticated fingers. Only a sensitive touch is now required for you to access web content, emails, view your photos or listen to your music.

The Device: The iPod touch is the next generation of ipod (in case you didn't notice) and now allows you to operate your device through the medium of quite a sexy touch screen. Rather than it simply be an ipod with a larger screen that makes it better for watching videos, it implements a lot more technology which enhances the usability of the contraption. One of the biggest differences from this ipod to the others isn't the screen, rather it is the introduction of wifi capability. This now allows the introduction of the famed Safari web browser for complete internet browsing in a wifi zone. You can also sync up your email account to your ipod touch so you can check them on the go (as long as your in a wifi zone).

Other Additions: The introduction of Wifi has also allowed for other cool applications to be brought in. The maps application is especially interesting as wherever you are, it allows you to locate yourself on the map and even set a route so it can give you directions to a given destination. The app store opens up a lot of possibilities as some of the apps may seem utterly pointless and silly to some yet may seem genius to others. Some of the better apps I have seen so far are solitaire, google earth and of course Facebook. A calendar, clock, notes taker and stock checker also allow you to keep on top of your daily routine. You can input entries onto your calendar, take a quick note and keep track of your stocks.

The iPod Stuff: When flipped on its side and going through your music you're given the cool feature of cover flow as you can swipe across the screen to reveal the album covers for your chosen song. Of course, sometimes the album covers may not be instantly available with your chosen song but luckily itunes has a cover search capability. Rotate it the vertical way and you're given a pretty basic list feature for those who just want to pick a song. Videos are much more pleasant to enjoy as thanks to the much larger screen, it gives you much more of a reason to add videos due to the fact that you can actually watch them now without straining your retinas.

The Look: Oooh shiny shiny, as with all apple products these days this just looks way ahead of his time. I wonder if Steve Jobs has a time machine, goes into the future and gets the technology for these devices from our future humans. One problem with the screen being all touchy and shiny is that it is easily scratched, or if you're a bit dirty there is the possibility that you could leave all sorts of finger prints on the screen. There are protectors, but of course that just means more money spent so if you buy one and don't want to spend more money then simply be careful.

It is a wonderful device and thanks to the itunes store being featured on the touch itself you can download songs straight to your ipod touch. Possibly the only device better than this has to be the iphone and that is truly something.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)

      



Like my long title says, its great to be running Office on Intel Macs without having to rely on Rosetta.  Running Office 2004 with Rosetta worked well.  Rosetta is an awesome technology, but it did translate into slow application launch times. Once the application started, everything was fine.

With this version, it runs natively on both Intel and PowerPC chips.  It is fast and stable.  IT is Office.  We all know and love/hate Office, so you probably already know what it can do.  It is missiing VBA support though.  This may be a problem for some.  I haven't experienced any of the negatives that other have reported.  The interface is a bit different, but easy to understand in just a few minutes of use.

I highly recommend Office 2008 if you need Microsoft Office.  Even if you have Office 2004, it is worth the upgrade just to get off of Rosetta.

As for the "Special" part of this particular version, it includes Microsoft's Expression Media.  This is a great addition to the package, but I doubt Expression Media will gain traction against Apple's iLife suite and other Apple branded media applications, such as Aperture.  It is worth trying though, as you may find them more intuitive if you are a long-time Microsoft user.  It is similar to Aperture, in that, you can manage your media even if it is stored offline on CDs or DVDs.  Its a nice digital media organizer.

Without a doubt, this is one of the most thorough, sweat-inducing workouts I have ever done. EVER. Jillian Michaels is simply amazing, and after doing her DVD's, there is just no going back to any other trainer for me. 
No more trouble zones is just fantastic. The first ab cicuit had my stomach musscles screaming (and I do ab work very frequently) and the segment that focuses on your triceps does, as Jillian says, actually make them feel like they are on fire. I have already, after just a few weeks, noticed a change in my body and have seen increased definition in my muscles. Alternating this with Jillian's Banish Fat Boost Metabolism DVD makes for a killer exercise regime!

I wrote a review for the feliway plug in, which I have been extremely pleased with. I ordered the feliway spray as a 'reinforcement' to keep my hallway poop and pee free. I have a purebred female persian cat who is 10 years old who can be a little moody when something bugs her. She has peed in my upstairs hallway in the past and nothing will stop a cat once they decide they want to mark. I tore up the carpet and pad, used every enzime product there is on the market (they did not work), used vinegar and water (got rid of the smell but not the problem), treated the subfloor of the upstairs and used kilz oil based primer spray to lock in any remnants of the kitty pee. I finally had a pee free house, so I put in a berber like carpet with stainmaster and a waterproof carpet pad. Everything was fine but one day I thought I smelled something nasty upstairs, and lo and behold I caught my cat peeing again out of the box. She was examined by the vet and no health problems were present-the vet chalked it up to 'surface preference', which I did not believe because I have carpet in my family foom which is pee-free.  I chalked it up to a fussy cat with some emotional problems....she also began to poop in the hallway as well (not a nice thing to wake up to)....I found the feliway plug in on amazon after a google search and decided to give it a try....I used the plug-in in the middle of the hallway and miraculously the cat has not peed or pooped anywhere except her litter box! I am in total shock! I read up some more on the feliway and decided to try the spray when I made my next order of the plug in refills. I spritz the three spots DAILY where she peed/pooped before and now she won't even think of getting near the corner where she did her bad deeds. I don't know how it works but it does, even on an emotional 10 year old kitty. I noticed she is calmer and more loving as well. Amazon has the best price when it comes to the spray and the plug in and refills. Oh yeah, I also had family in over Thanksgiving stay with me for 5 days, which would normally cause a poop or pee outburst after day three or four. I did not have one incident during or after the visit! I wish I had discovered feliway years ago-it would have saved me a lot of hassle and cleaning and $$$$. It is definitely worth the money!

If you are looking for a high quality portable external USB-powered high capacity hard drive at an affordable price, this is your choice!

Ownership: 5 days.

Pros:
1. High quality as SimpleTech is using a Western Digital (WD) internal hard drive disk (HDD) known to be a state-of-the-art HDD.
2. As portable (small size and light) as WD passport.
3. USB-powered or bus-powered. As single USB port of some computers can not provide enough power, SimpleTech is providing you with USB 2.0 Y-cable (not provided with WD passport) which can be used to hook up your drive to two USB ports of your computer to get enough power. This drive also has a power port (power cable is not provided, however, WD passport has no power port at all) in case you prefer to use a power cable. However, My laptop (almost 5 years old now) does not need it! I hook up this drive to a single USB port of my laptop and it works. I am so happy after knowing this as I was afraid to buy this drive considering that it may not work with a single USB port (my laptop has only two USB ports so that I would run out of it and not be able to use any other USB device, like mouse at the same time)! Make sure you use the main USB (not the pigtail, take a look at the picture above). WD will make you buy an expensive Y-cable if you need it. Moreover, this Y-cable from SimpleTech is longer than USB cable from WD.
4. Highest capacity portable drive available as of today (comparable to WD 320 GB passport).
5. I bought it from Amazon marketplace (ZENCORP) for $ 97.99 plus $ 6.49 S&H (no tax). The merchant offered the best price as of that day. I ordered it on Friday, merchant shipped (from MD) it on Saturday via DHL, and I received (at CA) it on Monday with excellent packaging! You can not possibly get this awesome deal for WD 320 GB passport right now.
6. Plug N play just like WD passport. My laptop immediately recognized this drive (also 3 of my school desktops, all of them required only one USB port) when I hooked up for the 1st time.
7. Hot-swappable just like WD passport.
8. Great look! After all, designed by Pininfarina! To me, WD passport does not look any better.
9. USB port of this drive is naked which is good because I always felt awkward in handling WD passport's port (WDXMS2500CN, bought from Costco) as it has a flap on it. WD made USB port naked only in their newest model (WDME3200TN).
10. Blue light shows that HDD is connected to the computer as a local disk, flashes when working, red light shows that power is on! WD passport indicator light does not show you these details.
11. 3 years warranty, just like WD passport's. Very important.
12. Did not try the softwares, but back-up and other utilities like simple, automatic backups with Fabrik local backup and complete protection with Fabrik ultimate backup online service (2 GB free), joggle software for organizing photos, songs, and video come with it. Will comment after use.
13. Free tech support over the phone.  WD's tech support is available for free only upto 30 days after you give them the 1st call. WD's tech support guys know (including the higher level, really annoying) as much as you do being an ordinary person with some standard technical understanding.
14. PC/Mac compatible just like WD passport.
15. Base has pad-like structure to protect the drive.
16. It is as quiet and fast as WD passport. Its stays cool just like WD passport.
17. Pre-formatted to NTFS as compared to FAT32 (WD passport). Most people use PC rather than Mac!

Cons: Not many! I believe pros simply wins over cons.
1. As scratchable as WD passport.
2. 5400 rpm only, however, this is the highest speed available for all portable drives including WD's.
3. Capacity is not as high as that of  larger drives.
4. No firewire 400/800 or eSATA or 10/100/1000 ethernet ports. You can not possibly expect these with portable drives.
Make sure you buy a carrying case, the best being from case LOGIC (model # PHDC-1) in order to protect the drive and for carrying convenience.
There are other portable drives in the market, say, WD, Seagate, Toshiba,  Iomega, HP, Maxtor, but none of them are better than this one. I own this and I owned WD passport (WDXMS2500CN) and returned it.

Did I say enough about this excellent gadget? Buy one and enjoy it!!!

I bought this MP3 player for my daughter for Christmas.  She had an older Creative Mp3 for the last 3 years and was ready for a new one.  She loves this player.  It was really easy to set up and load.  It's much easier to navigate than the older versions.  I would recommend this player to anyone.  A great deal for the price.  My daughter chose this player over all the ipod's.  She thinks it's much easier to load music and control playlist.  Most of her friends have ipods, but she chose Creative instead.
I hope this helps.

I bought 1 iPod shuffle for my 18 year old daughter for her birthday. When I received it in the mail and opened the box to look at it before I wrapped it up for my daughter I thought the iPod was missing. My 16 year old daughter started laughing and picked up and handed me the iPod. I thought it was just the belt clip it was so small!! I joined iTunes so she could download music I told her I wanted to check out the quality of sound man was I blown away with the sound quality. As a matter of fact I am going to buy one for myself  the sound is that great. Also the price is right I have a mp3 and the difference between it and the iPod is about the same as compairing an 
8 Track player against a CD player.

I wish I had found this sooner.  I have a very furry seventeen-year-old Himalayan.  I usually get him shaved once a year because he matts up.  But I didn't this year because his health is precarious and I didn't want to stress him.  The Furminator gets the undercoat smooth like no other brush I have used.  And my grumpy old cat doesn't mind it as long as I alternate petting with gentle strokes using the Furminator and go slow around matts. It gets fur off our young, short-haired Tonkinese also.  Now I just need to learn to make yarn and knit.  I could make a sweater with the fur that is so easily removed!

For a connoisseur of iced tea such as myself this is a most wonderful gadget, it works so well that I bought a second one just in case anything happens to it then I'll have a replacement. 

I have a suggestion to offer about the manufacturer's instructions or for anyone who makes their own iced tea. If you have always had a problem with your tea tasting bitter after you make it then try this, DO NOT ADD ICE BEFORE BREWING as per the mfgs instructions, also never boil water with tea in it, add hot water to your tea, steep for about 3 minutes no longer than 4-5 minutes, or in this case just let the machine handle it, after you brew your tea and remove the loose tea or bags, LET THE PITCHER SET OPEN TOPPED TO AIR OUT FOR AT LEAST 10 MINUTES. In this time I have found that the bitterness seeps out and the end result is far better tasting tea, much smoother and with less bite. After that add ice to chill then fill to the top line with cold water and make it the way you like. 

I have always thought that the cafeterias and nice restaurants have made the best tea, but now I have surpassed even the best of restaurants by trying different teas and brewing them together for fabulous flavors. This Hamilton Beach Tea Maker has its own tea strainer built in but you can also remove the strainer and use a regular round pleated coffee filter which will make it much easier to dispose of the wet loose tea when you are done brewing. 

To start with try 2 heavy tablespoons of Lipton Black Pearl tea, (regular Lipton loose tea will also be fine) I cut it out of the little pyramid bags it comes in and keep it loose in a sealed container, set the brew dial on strong and follow above instructions...Enjoy.

I bought one of these along with three MSI PC60G (Ralink 61). Right now I'm using it with the tomato firmware, but even the standard one was fine. One of the clients is in a room outside the house (there are two thick walls and a kitchen between the router and the PC), another is directly upstairs (again, an old, thick floor) and the third is still waiting for the assembly. The signal is surprisingly good (even with the linksys firmware, but better with tomato set to 42mW), though I had to keep trying channels until I found one that didn't suffer from intermitent noise outside the house (probably coming from a neighbor using a 2.4GHz telephone). The QOS with tomato is great, too. The router keeps cool even here in Rio de Janeiro!

Great razor. I have been using the triple head Norelco razor since the 70's and mine died. This is a nice replacement and actually works better. It does not bite or leave stubbles.

I'm glad I got it and can recommend it to others in need of a razor. My wife wants to try it out, but I'm afraid she'll use it all the time.

This razor is nice looking and sleek. It is not too heavy or big (which works great with aging and disabilities) It is easy to use, clean and charge. I like the LED light. I understand this to be just a preference.

I always hated getting up and brewing a 4 cup pot of coffee just for me as no in else in my house drinks coffee.  Often wasted 2 cups or more.  Almost didn't seem worth the mess.  Then my brother-in-law turned on to the Keurig line.  It has raised my coffee drinking from something to drink at breakfast to get going to something fun.  I enjoy buying different varieties of coffee and having a different one every day.  I love my Keurig so much, I bought one for the office.  My coworkers love it also and some have bought one for home use.  It is a little noisy when others in the house are asleep but, as far as I know, I haven't woken anybody up.

Purchased: the full set (yoke, throttle, and rudder)

Biggest problem first (and solution?): I was beset with random keypresses, view switching, random gear changes, etc.

However, I took a look at the key assignments page in FS9: the rudder pedals had quite a few buttons assigned to different tasks, which is strange because the rudder has NO buttons, only axes.

I un-assigned all of them, and did the same to the Yoke/Quadrant buttons that I don't use... remapped gear/flaps/lights to buttons on the quadrant instead.  This worked for me, though I don't exactly remember which Button #'s were giving me trouble... I was just suspicious when the Button #s displayed in config were sometimes higher than the total number of buttons I could count on the controller.

General Nit-picking:
The yoke was a great upgrade for me from a joystick, although its movement on both axes are slightly sticky/make creaking sounds (maybe some oil will do?).  As for the throttle, I wish it were inclined forward about 45?(much like in airliner cockpits), and I wish it came with extra knobs (I can't find them for sale anywhere!)... can't imagine they'd be that expensive to make!

Before I say this, know that I have 4 kids and I am very busy. I have not been into books in quite some time, but I devoured the 4 books in one month.
This book is a necessary piece of the 4 book collection. It didn't go along with what I wanted to happen in the story line for a long while, but I found that it kept me on edge more than any other book in the series. I found myself crying and sometimes shaking with anticipation.
Only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is because of course I wanted more Edward!

I read this book cover to cover (including the little sub-texts next to all the food products) and it's a good guide! Not all the "EAT THIS" foods are healthy... but the author does note that if that's the case.  

I am extremely health conscious-- I read labels constantly, and I'd say I have a pretty good grasp of what's good for my family and I when I go grocery shopping. HOWEVER-- major supermarkets these days seem to tote 30 different brands of crackers, breads, lean meals, deli meat, soy products-- ALL claiming to be free of trans fat, made with natural ingredients, whole grains, etc-- who has 3 hours to read nutrition labels every time they go to the grocery store?? If I'm alone I can take the time to pay attention to labels, but I can understand parents not being able to do that, when you have kids nagging you to buy certain things.  This book is by no means an end all nutrition guide, but its a step in the right direction for busy people to start making better choices.

This is my second purchase of this item (as a gift, and I plan to buy more for friends in the future) It is the perfect size - I don't know if I would have bought the "individual servings" product.  I make a batch every day or two and have had only one bad batch in almost a year...and then because the starter yogurt was at its expiration date. After that bad batch, because I buy the 32 oz. size, I always check the expiration date.  To protect the Salton plastic container, I heat the milk/dry milk combination in the microwave in a large Pyrex mixing bowl with a handle.  When I take the milk out of the microwave, I remove the yogurt (1/2 c.) from the refrigerator to bring it to room temp while the milk is cooling.  I also plug in the Salton heating unit to warm it up.  I use an electronic thermometer - once set, it beeps when the milk is at the right temperature.  After adding the yogurt to the cooled milk, I pour it into the Salton plastic container.  Because I have always done this, the container is still like brand new.  I have 1 cup of yogurt instead of milk with my Kashi cereal in the morning and add fruit and homemade granola to it for lunch, adding whatever flavoring (vanilla/almond) I want that day.  Every friend I have introduced to my homemade yogurt has wanted to make their own!  And it is sooo easy!  Try it, you'll like it!

So I have owned a number of manual and electric shavers/razors. This is the best purchase I have ever made.  I always recommend this product to all my friends who are in the market for a razor.  I thought I would half to finish off with my manual razor like I did with my old electric shaver. With the Braun it shaves closer than I did with my Mach 3/Fusion razor.  It cuts very close to the skin with no irritation.  And I am of Asian descent, who are usually known for having sensitive skin. The self cleaning makes my shaver seem likes its brand new every time I use it. You do half to buy new solution every few months, but I can usually get a two pack for $10 which is a CHEAP price to pay to have the feeling of a new shaver every morning.

I bought this particular color after reading other reviews about staining the matress. They looked good. One side is smooth like real satin but the other side is not so pleasant, it has a rougher texture. If you don't have a headboard for your bed, the pillows keep sliding off of the bed. I would rather buy 100% cotton sheets than "satin".

Our cat loves drinking out of the bathroom sink faucet, so it was great to find a water dish with a fountain that she would like.  The fountain is adjustable flow, the dish holds a fair amount of water, and the pump is pretty quiet.

If you let the water level drop, the pump will start sucking air and make a loud noise.  Not a terrible thing; it's a convenient reminder to refill the water every once in a while. But it does mean that the six-cup capacity doesn't translate into waiting for the cat to drink six cups before refilling the fountain.

You'll need to make sure the intake is free of hair, but it's pretty easy to do.  

My only complaint is that it's a bit awkward to clean, which you will have to do from time to time (the filter keeps the water pretty clean, but slime still grows on the submerged plastic surfaces).

I just bought a new laptop, an HP Pavilion  with Vista and needed a word proccessor and spreadsheet.  I am retired and don't need all the bells and whistles but I wanted to have what I was accustomed to in the MS products over the years.  This fills the bill for me and has probably more than I need. I am still getting used to the "ribbon" display which is to much information at the top. The good news it can be turned off.  I hear a lot of gripes about Vista but since I don't use any special software, compatability is not a problem for me. All the software I moved over from my other laptop works fine so far.  The Vista/ office Student and Home package fits my retirement needs very well.  I am still learning the details but I like the package. The new OneNote program that comes with Office is interesting but I have not had a chance to play with it yet except to read the help stuff that comes up when you start it.  It is a multi media type word and information processor that could be very useful.  I look forward to learning to use it.

The great benefit with the Touch is that it gives you the majority of the features and functions of the IPhone at a lower total cost: no higher monthly service charges from your cellular provider; no issues with battery life; no problems with sound quality. For me, using a regular 3G network cell phone with global and BlueTooth capabilities with the Touch provides all of the service that I want. You can pick up a wireless node pretty much anywhere when you need Web or email functions, and you have your phone for when you just need to make a call. Buy the Touch, then go to an Apple store to get a tutorial on using it.

Bottom line - this is great drama.  Riveting storyline and great acting combine to make this a can't miss.  The sci-fi setting is the icing on the cake.  It casts our world in a different setting, allowing the viewer to see current issues in a different perspective.  The relationships among the characters are well-written and complex. Rolling Stone and MSNBC are right - this is one of the best shows on TV.

This is another example of what good sci fi writing can be! The re-imagined Battlestar Galactica truly has so little to do with special effects and space adventures but rather the human struggle. Their plight is no different than what we see in Darfur and the SUdan today- genocide and mass exodus. There are times in BSG where you really forget they are in space! The devvelopment of even minor characters is unparalelled in a TV serial. They are nominated for an Emmy for Best Drama, and I hope they get it. This set contains a ton of interesting extras, and is well worth the money.

We purchased this gate by default but ended up loving it.  We needed a gate wide enough to close off a hallway (both bathroom and basement stairs are behind it) and it was one of the few that would adjust wide enough.  I origionally wanted a "hands free" gate but soon found out from friends that with time the toddlers weight and creativity would enable them to open it.  My son is 25 months now, and still is unable to breach the security of this gate.  We chose not to drill holes in the wall to secure the cups & help hold the gate in alignment, so we do need to adjust the "swing" about every 2 months.  Does not seem to be a problem for us nor does the one handed opening.  The reviews about "slamming" the gate never even crossed my mind, we walk through our gate-not run and thus it closes slower.  I have also tried to make sure my child is used to noise during sleep from the start (lets face it, the world can't always be quiet just because the baby is sleeping).  I love this gate and the fact that there is no place for my child to get a "foot hold" and climb is extra helpful, the height makes me feel more confident that he will not try to climb over and end up falling on his head.  I do reccomend putting opening instrutions on the top for when company comes to visit.

This review is from: Slumdog Millionaire [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)

      



"Slumdog Millionaire" is nothing short of Genius and brilliant.
It's basically a love story but very interestingly and unconventionally told about three young children  two brothers Jamal and Salim and a girl Latika who meet under tragic circumstances when they are very young.The love story revolves around Jamal and Latika
The big story is that years later Jamal is on an Indian version of "I want to be a millionaire" and is accused of cheating so while being interrogated by police he  explains how he knows the answer to each question by recounting events that have taken place in his life answer by answer.
what comes next is a very emotional and violent depiction of  Jamal's life and how it intertwines with his brother Salim , Latika and many other intresting characters.
Slumdog Millionaire is not always easy to watch due to violence but it's  very rewarding.
It's not often you get a true to life depiction that's not glossed over and yet have it be one of the most feel good movies to date as well.Just as it swept the Golden Globes
I expect this movie to sweep the Academy Awards and well deserved it is.

"We at Digital Media Source apologize for any inconvenience. Due to an error on Amazons part they somehow reduced our listing price to .01 on the 16GB Sandisk Cruzer (from $35) yesterday morning. While we noticed the error within a couple hours of this occuring there was by that time over 1750 orders placed for over 6000 units!!  This for an item which we only usually sell a few per day. (we only stock 20-30 units!!!) Obvously any rational buyer would realize a price of .01 on a $35 item must be some sort of mistake. We do not have the inventory nor the finacial means to honor these orders at that price. We are a small family run company. A 180K loss would put us out of business. In fact we wouldn't even have the finacial capability to obtain 6000 units. While we apologize for any incovenience this may have caused we had no choice but to cancel theses orders.  Thank you for your understanding and we once again apologize for any inconvenience."

I must have been lucky, because I purchased one recently and I only paid $120 for it and it included 2 boxes of coffee pods (24 pods in each box).  I like the look and the ease of using this item.  I order my supplies from Green Mountain Coffee.  They have a huge variety of coffee, tea and hot chocolate.  I like that the coffee maker has 3 cup size settings, but there still could be another one that is larger.  My hubby likes to use a HUGE travel mug, so he ends up brewing 2 pods, one at the 9.25 setting and one at the 5.25 setting to fill his mug.  The middle size is perfect size for me when I brew tea.  The only problem we have with it, is that it makes a ton of noise when filling the water.  I have a corporate Keurig at work and that one makes no noise at all.  If it wasn't noisy I would give 5 stars.

You may be interested in the Logitech?Dual Action?Gamepad for the same reason that I was: it is as close to a console pad as you can find and it doesn't cost all that much. $15-20 really isn't too bad of a price for one of these things considering the cost of certain other gamepads. But when you get into using the Logitech?Dual Action?Gamepad for any period of time you may start to notice certain problems popping up, and that might lead you to think that your money was not well spent. 

The Logitech?Dual Action?Gamepad is wonderful out of the box, its feel and the response of the controls are both nice- with the exception of the difficulty you will experience with the directional pad on the left side (it is hard to move anything in a specific direction for long). Once you have 'worn it in', though, the Logitech?Dual Action?Gamepad starts to show some of its real nasty habits. Mostly it has to do with the 'dual action' portion of the gamepad- the analog joysticks. After playing an analog joystick-intensive game like, say, Madden football or NBA Live; the sticks (especially the left side) will start to lose its calibration on a regular basis. This is an easy fix: just unplug it and plug it back in. Though it does get tiring when you have to do this every 30 seconds. The other problem with the joysticks is that they just plain wear out. After many, many hours of play (as I have put to the test), you will notice that your joystick will not work in many ways no matter how many times you re-plug it in. 

All in all, despite all of its problems, I like the Logitech?Dual Action?Gamepad and would recommend it to someone, as I have not found a more attractive alternative. My suggestion is that if you do buy one, buy it at Best Buy where you can also purchase a warranty on it. The warranty is only a few dollars more and if anything goes wrong with it- which WILL happen- you can return it for a brand new one, no questions asked. I, myself, am on my 9th controller. The hassle of having to go back to Best Buy aside (I shop there a lot anyway), I kind of like getting a new controller every few months- all for just the price of a few dollars more at purchase time. Buy the warranty.

We currently live in housing on base in Germany and the stairs are very wide and unusual. I got this gate since it is made for the top of the stairs and was wide enough for our staircase. It works great! I love that it slides to the side as well as opens. Was a breeze to install and I feel really safe with the fact that it is a really great hardware mount. No complaints here my son is 10 months and pulls up on everything so it is nice to know he is safe! The one hand open is really simple and I like it more than any gate I have seen at friends houses.

Short of handstripping, this thing does an amazing job!  Better on my wrist then my Mars stripping blade.

I dont understand how people claim this thing "cuts" the hair?  (Which is true with a new Mars blade if not used correctly.) I was afraid after reading numerous reviews of this... so what better way to test it then on my own hair??? ha ha ha I have very thick, brittle, chemically abused mid back hair, and this thing didnt break a SINGLE strand!  Amazed, I tackled down the nearest male to see if this will hold true for a "shorter" participant, my 63 year old father with short, thinning, fine hair, and again, not a strand.

I've kept sessions really short (about 5 min every 3-4 days) as my Westie hates getting brushed to begin with, and already what a remarkable difference!  (Best to get them after a good long walk when theyre all pooped out.)  The only hair that is removed is the hair ready to be shed anyways.  Already she looks much more kempt and looks as though she lost 10lbs!  I will never submit to clipping again as I want to keep a nice hard wiry coat on her! (Keeps her dirt free and nice and dry since I have a water baby who likes the pouring rain and likes to roll in bird poop....AND she's an all white dog!  I've also been "experimenting" on how long I can go without bathing her before someone in my household complains.... I have a very weak sense of smell...So I guess I'm lucky, but my mom and siblings have allergies and are very sensitive to smell, and they will NOT hesitate to raise heck since she's MY dog...but I've gone literally 6 months and no complaint yet...AND she's still white looking.... lol)

Overall, I agree with other reviewers that this is an excellent little drive, but there is one thing that has been missed so far in the reviews.

When I first got this drive, I was quite surprised to find out difficult it was to remove the cap, and it took me a few tries the first time.   It seems to have aged well, and now I don't even notice.  However, I bought this drive to replace another which developed the reverse problem: the cap became too loose and wouldn't stay on.  I suspect this drive will fare substantially better as a result of the tight-fitting cap.

To be clear, I don't consider this a negative, but I do think buyers should be aware of it so they aren't surprised at first.

This is a good product for someone that does not need a lot of sophisticated features.  Price is excellent. Quality is excellent.  This unit replaced a Timex model that originally cost more than 3 times as much at Costco, but this is better quality.

Product would be more useful if it displayed both stopwatch time and HR at the same time.  This design requires switching by pressing a button.

A problem with all these HR monitors is that the sensing pads stop working if your skin becomes dry.  The Omron unit seems much less subject to this problem.

Iron Man  (2008) One of Marvel Comics' coolest, if not most famous superheroes finally gets brought to the big screen for the first time in this new flick from director Jon Favreau. Robert Downey Jr. stars as Tony Stark, a brilliant billionaire industrialist and weapons manufacturer carrying on the legacy of his late father in designing bigger and better weapons to protect this great land of ours. He is a hard drinking, womanizing, self centered vanity case, but his charm carries him, along with the piles of money he makes. While on a junket in Afghanistan to show off his newest missile, Stark's convoy is attacked and he is caught by a ruthless Afghani terrorist cabal. The attack left Stark with deadly shrapnel in his chest, threatening his heart, but a fellow scientist prisoner manages to cobble together a nasty looking but effective electromagnetic pacemaker and jam it into Stark's chest to hold the shrapnel at bay. The terrorists want Stark to build them one of his new missiles, but seeing them using his weaponry, devices he created to protect Americans, which there should be no way they could have, Stark has a figurative change of heart to go along with his literal one. He agrees to make the rocket, and makes a list of materials he'll need. When the baddies give him the goods however, he instead cobbles together a clunky but highly effective armored battlesuit he uses to wipe out most of the villains and escape. Back in America, Stark picks up his old life with Air Force pal Rhodey (Terrence Howard), mentor Stane (Jeff Bridges), and especially Girl Friday Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). He does have to deal with wearing a glowing chest ornament the size of a small dinner plate, but no Marvel Comics hero's life is perfect, no matter how much money he has. Stark also takes the battlesuit design further, building a sleeker, faster version that turns him fully into the superhero Iron Man. Now, with all this high tech weaponry at his disposal, he has to find out who has sold him out by selling his weapons design to Afghani terrorists. And, unknown to Stark, that same someone is using the pieces of his first design to reverse engineer an even larger, more deadly battlesuit. Once again, jumping right into line with "Michael Keaton as Batman" I wasn't sure an Iron Man movie starring Robert Downey Jr and directed by Jon Favreau would be what I wanted it to be. And once again I couldn't have been more wrong. Downey is totally committed and up to the game, giving Stark a roguish charm that is simply perfect, and he's not afraid to let the identity hiding armor take over when Iron Man shows up. Of course, it doesn't hurt that unlike Spider-Man, director Favreau can cut to close-ups of Downey inside the armor, so we the audience still get to see all the emotions the actor's face can show without having to rip the hero's mask off in every scene. The casting is perfect down the line, with every actor and actress looking exactly like the comics' version, and that extends to the moment after the credits too many people will have missed, a fine bit that promises more fun to come AND ties this film directly to another summer release this year. (Crossover sequel anyone?) Kudos to director Favreau for balancing the action and lighter moments, and providing a lot of flash bang but not letting the movie coast on the effects. (He also takes a prime role for anyone familiar with Iron Man's comics backstory as chauffeur "Happy" Hogan, who doesn't get a lot of screen time here, but promises to show up more in the sequel and get some quality time with Paltrow!) All in all a fun flick I highly recommend to those so inclined.

This is one of the best ideas and pieces of hardware I have seen in a long time. The 9" screen is just about the right size for laptop. The keyboard is a little odd at first being small, but once you are used to it, you can easily type with both hands just as fast as you can on a normal keyboard. I also recommend for anyone who uses Linux to look up how to unlock the "Full desktop" feature ........ it will enhance the experience quite a bit. For a normal user who just wants to surf, type up documents and IM, or chat on Skype and have both pictures and music portable it is excellent. Also, if you buy the Linux version and have a copy of Windows XP spare, the Linux manual gives instructions to install XP instead and back up the Linux part, so you will benefit getting this model over the XP one, as you will get the larger drive and the option to add XP if you ever feel like it (the Xnadros based Linux works just great though!). Awesome device and best buy I've made in the last few years.

3. Heat the milk mixed in step 2 to about 190 degree fahrenheit.
4. Let the milk cool down to 110 degree fahrenheit.
5. Add the yogurt culture (previous made yogurt) or use half of the yogurt culture (http://www.amazon.com/Yogurt-Culture-2-X-5g/dp/B00062KTX0/ref=pd_rhf_p_t_2)
6. gently mix the culture into the milk
7. Put into the yogurt maker and leave for 5-8 hours.
8. The yogurt should be made by this time so put it in the freezer for 8 hours (to stop the yogurt from getting tart and stopping the yogurt making enzymes).

Eat the yogurt after it has cooled after 8 hours. 

Note that the longer we leave yogurt in yogurt maker (8 hours), the tarter it gets. 4 cups of milk makes about 1 quart (nearly 1 litre) of yogurt. If you eat a lot of yogurt then it is better to buy 2 of these machines since you only have to the procedure with the milk once then.

I loved this "final" book, mostly because it becomes immediately apparent upon finishing it that we have only begun to delve into this amazing world Stephenie Meyer has created.  Now I just want to live long enough (I'm 61 and proud of it) to read it all.

I think the author did everything right.  Bella and Edward are two of the most believable lovers in any universe ever, and lovely Jacob, and all their other friends and family.  Makes me want to pull up stakes and head for the Pacific Northwest, just on the off chance...oh, probably not.  I wondered if, when our young lovers finally "got together" in the truly carnal sense, it would work.  And boy, did it.

Don't get me wrong, I like a well written sex scene as much as the next woman.  And Ms. Meyer manages to convey the intensity of their true passion for each other without all the details which would truly not be appropriate for these books; for details, we can go elsewhere.  But I don't feel like I lost any sense of their relationship and it's potency despite the taste with which those scenes were handled.  Unlike other authors of initially popular series (who shall remain nameless), who chose to go for debauchery at the expense of all else including story and character (yes, I too loved the early Anita Blake books; I'm no prude, but give an old lady a break and please, keep your therapy sessions to yourself, I so don't care!).

I saw a lot of complaints about Ms. Meyer "just tying everything together".  Well, duh.  What was she supposed to do?  Did you truly want a bloody battle?  Who would you have sacrificed?  For the story created here, she tied up her endings perfectly.  In fact, I saw no endings, only new beginnings and the future looks bright indeed.

Like I said, let me live long enough to enjoy the further adventures of Bella, Edward, Alice, Jacob, Renesmee (have to admit I hate that name, but that's my only complaint), all of the Cullens and their friends, old and new.  And I certainly hope to be there cheering Stephan and Vladimir on when the Volturi finally do fall.  It should be an interesting ride. 

Way to go, Stephenie Meyer.  Don't make us wait too long, please.

I wanted to start walking more as I have a very sedentary job. I bought a Sportline pedometer first (Sportline 353 Talking Pedometer) about a year ago. It worked fine counting steps but had other issues. 

It was constantly slipping off my waistband and bouncing off the floor. It also easily reset. If I bumped the reset button with the seat belt all my fine walking data was lost. You could theoretically keep a walking tally for a week - but I accidentally hit the reset button 2-3 times a day at times. It was very frustrating. The clip broke after about 3 months, so I retired it.

I bought a Omron HJ112 Premium Pedometer and have worn it almost every day since. It has a teather. Even if the clip slips off my waistband, the pedometer dangles from the teather - it doesn't bounce off the floor. Also the clip is part of a separate holder - if the spring breaks it could easily and inexpensively be replaced.

It also works attached to my bookbag or purse strap, in my pocket or in my purse. It doesn't count as well attached to a down jacket pocket -- but a denim jacket or blazer lapel works fine. 

It has a clock, and a 7 day memory. At midnight it automatically stores the day's data and resets to zero. It tallies daily:  steps, mileage, calories burned, aerobic steps, and time spent in aerobic activity. It saves that information (except for time spent in aerobic activity) for 7 days. This is good if I am traveling and not near my fitness log for 2-3 days.

One trick: Sometimes I go out walking at 11:30 PM -- especially if I have been on the computer all evening. But the pedometer resets at midnight -- late night walks would get split over 2 days. So I leave the clock off by one hour. The pedometer starts its new day at 1AM. And I am always in bed by then. Promise. :-) 

I like very much that it counts the number of aerobic steps and the time spent. My goal (in addition to just walking more) is to walk a minimum of 30 minutes a day at an aerobic pace (and increasing this amount). According to the manual: "Aerobic steps are counted separately when walking or jogging more than 60 steps per minute or more than 10 minutes continuously."

The pedometer has been very helpful. If I come in from the bus stop and just go to my desk I walk about 1000 steps. If I come in from the bus stop and keep moving for just a few minutes longer - climb the stairs to my office on an upper floor and then go get water for coffee - I get in 10 minutes of aerobic activity.

When I started wearing a pedometer I was getting in about 3000  steps a day (none aerobic). I average about 8000 now and working up to 10,000 (about 4000 aerobic). 

I haven't changed much noticeabe. I park on the other side of the parking lot at the grocery store. I walk the cart back to the store -- not just the buggy coral. I get off the bus a stop early - about a block and a half away (1000 steps). I take the stairs at work (20 steps per floor). I walk the dog each night for about 30 minutes (5000 steps). I sit outside for lunch instead of sitting in my office with a sandwich (1000 steps). Little extra steps like this all day long add up.

Walking is great exercise and unlike swimming or going to the gym, all I have to do is walk out the door. "Aerobics on a stick" I call it. The pedometer helps me stay motivated and it reminds me to walk walk walk!

I purchased a couple of these in each size as he grew, and he reluctantly gave them up after he was 2 1/2 (I was concerned about him tripping because he insisted on wearing it while walking; however I think they have since come up with a version that allows the feet to poke through).

This review is from: Doubt [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)

      



"Doubt", Father Brendan Flynn tells his congregation, "can be a bond as powerful and sustaining as certainty."  So fitting that an engaging sermon on Doubt should begin a film so thoroughly based on it.  John Patrick Shanley's DOUBT is an engaging drama about what to do and where you go when you are uncertain and filled with, for lack of a better term, doubts.  He wrote and directed this film based on his Tony and Pulitzer Award-Winning play.  In one of the rich texts of the original play, Sister James asks Flynn if he always makes up little stories to accompany his messages.  He replies, "Yes.  What actually happens in life is beyond interpretation.  It tends to be confusing and have no clear conclusion."  Shanley seems to agree.  In fact, he added the subtitle "A Parable" to DOUBT's title after it opened on Broadway.  He created his own little story to explain his reasoning and thoughts on that all-enveloping feeling of uncertainty and despair.  His play succeeded, and his film succeeds on many levels as well. 

Meryl Streep plays Sister Aloysius, the principal of St. Nichol's Catholic School.  She rules with an iron fist, hissing and hitting students during sermons and interrupting classes to humiliate and punish kids.  When told by Sister James, adeptly played by Amy Adams, that "the students are all uniformly terrified of you", Streep replies wryly and nonchalantly: "That's how it works".  She is, at heart, a traditionalist, who loathes Father Flynn and everything he does and stands for.  When suggested that the school Christmas Pageant might include a secular song like "Frosty the Snowman" she rants on how the song inspires a pagan belief in magic and how it should be banned from the airwaves.  Trust me that "Frosty" is never mentioned again.  We know little of Sister Aloysius's past, other than she was married to a man who died in WWII.  Is her lasting grief the reason she's so bitter?  We never know, and it doesn't really matter.  That's why Shanley's character development is so unique.  He doesn't present us with life stories or background material.  We know who the characters are and what they're like now, and their attitudes and actions in the moment shape our perception of them.  We learn about them from their actions only, and we don't get motives or back-story.  Shanley doesn't psychoanalyze his characters; he presents them to us and leaves us to make of them what we will.  Aloysius is a true conservative, incorruptible and solid in her faith and methods...the true nun.  She will "do what needs to be done".

That's why she launches herself and Sister James into a campaign of suspicion against Flynn, who has taken a particular interest in the school's first African American student, Donald Muller.  Sister James comes to Aloysius with concerns: Flynn has summoned Muller to the rectory for a private meeting, and, after returning, Donald acted strangely and smelt of alcohol.  He's the alter boy.  Did he sneak some wine?  Or, as Aloysius is convinced, was he given some by Flynn?  After an initial confrontation with Flynn, Aloysius is convinced he is taking advantage of young Donald and his fervent denials are lies.  Sister James wants no part of it, but it's too late.  She's in it already.  And Sister Aloysius won't stop until Father Flynn is punished for his sin.  It's no matter that there is no proof whatsoever.  She has her certainty, and she's justified in all means she uses to bring him to justice.

Streep's personification of Aloysius is one of the best I've seen.  She completely submerges herself into the character, adapting mannerisms and speaking habits so unique and perfect you find yourself saying, this can't possibly be the woman I saw bouncing on mattresses, jumping with wild gesticulations into the ocean, and singing ABBA songs in the trailer for MAMMA MIA!   Well, it is.  That's the thing about Streep; she plays all of her roles with such cleverness and exclusivity that you can't possibly associate them closely with each other.  As Sister Aloysius she is a tsunami of acting, debating with Flynn with such forcefulness and convincing James with such smoothness and wit.  It's a knock she'll get an Oscar nomination for this role, and she deserves to win.

Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Flynn, can't seem to decide whether his character is in the wrong or not.  One minute he'll make Flynn's denials seem false and forced, but in some scenes, as in the last debate between him and Streep, he is so convincing his innocence is thoroughly established in our minds.  Just as we can't decide, neither can he.  In one scene his characteristics will scream "I'm lying!  I've sinned!  Look no further, here I am!" and in some other scenes he'll make you wander how you ever questioned his purity.  Maybe this was how he intended to play his character, but I found myself wishing he would, as an actor, decide whether Flynn was in the right or not and play the character that way.  Anyhow, his arguments with Streep, especially the last, shoot out sparks from the screen.  

Amy Adams is wonderful in her role as Sister James, the nun who got herself into this mess and just wants out.  She came to Sister Aloysius with the purest of intentions, and now she is punished for it.  "I wish I could be like you," she tells Aloysius.  "Because I can't sleep at night anymore.  Everything seems uncertain to me." In early scenes she is radiant while teaching, a joy to the kids in her class and a joy for the audience to watch.  During a later scene in her classroom, she is overwhelmed by it all.  She becomes Aloysius, snapping at her students and threatening punishment.  She apologizes to the class, but by the end of the film she is transformed.  She has doubts, and she's lost her joy in teaching.  She looks up to Aloysius as something to strive to and to Flynn as a mentor, and she's torn between them.  Adams, in her early scenes, reminds one of her earlier role as Giselle in ENCHANTED, but soon she breaks out of the mold and fleshes out her character.  Viola Davis will be nominated and will probably win Best Supporting Actress for her brief role as Donald's mother, who wants him to complete the school.  "It's just `till June," she says.  After this school, he may even have a chance at college.  She's accepting of her son's "nature" and is fine with Flynn's relationship with her boy.  "He has his motives," she says.  "Everyone has their motives, you have yours.  But do I question him, when he's kind to my boy?  Never."  She's heartbreaking in her only scene, as a mother who just can't do any more.  She wants the best for her son, but when will wanting the best come to something bad?  When does it get to the point where she just doesn't care anymore?

Questions, questions.  The film is full of them, and not all of them get answered.  Many will be unsatisfied with the end of the film, but I thought it was perfect.  The final line and final revelation of the film spoke oceans to me, and it further proved Shanley's talent as a writer.  He is a decent director as well, using several inventive techniques to exploit the audience's emotions.  And yes, several emotions are exploited.  This film is an intelligent, engaging drama and you won't stop thinking until way after the credits are done rolling.  Think of how many films keep you on your toes and provoke thoughts and questions still after the film is over?  I bet that list is short.  

DOUBT succeeds as a very appealing and satisfying drama.  It forces one to look deeper than the initial suspicion and the initial revelation.  The performances are top-class and the script inspired.  The messages and feelings the story provoke and poignant and affecting...thought not necessarily classified as "morals" there are many themes to the story that you would be hard pressed not to pick up.  Yes, doubt affects everyone, even the most firm.  But when does uncertainty envelop all?  How far does certainty alone carry you?  How can circumstance be enough to condemn a man or prove his innocence?  Ask yourself these questions while viewing DOUBT, but be open for your answers to change.  Don't be too certain, like Sister Aloysius.  For purity can give way to corruption, and conviction can give way to doubt.

All winter I've been making soup about once a week.  Many of the soups need to be pureed, or partially pureed.  All winter I've been pouring batches of hot soup into my food processor and making a huge mess and a sink full of things to be washed.  Today I made soup, and voila!  Its pureed!  In seconds!  And only one small item to wash.  I can't believe I didn't buy this item sooner.  I haven't tried the chopper attachment but I'm looking forward to it.  If it works as well as the blender I'll be thrilled!  Smoothies are next.

The Sonicare elite-2 brush head will not give you white, even shining teeth right away. You need to wait for a week or two. This head is the best of the best. Sonicare users have the best looking teeth, and this brush head is so soft. I feel like I am brushing with a rose- my teeth are so shiny and feel so clean- no other electric or electronic toothbrush has this ability. Bar none.
There are many other electrc toothbrushes on the market, some for a very few dollars. But do they give you the feeling of fresh breath, the luxury of running your tongue over smooth, clean teeth? Not like the Sonicare. The Sonicare is the elite of toothbrushes This is the best. The best of th best. Only those who care the very best, who want the best in life, use the Sonicare. But, Sonicare is for the everyday masss, they just deon't know it yet!Buy it now. Highly recommended. prisrob

I can't believe the price I got for this mixer... I could've even avoided shipping costs if I hadn't waited 'til too close to Christmas.
This is a fantastic machine.  One caution... The bowl lift models are much taller than the other style.  Our kitchen cabinets are mounted about 1/4" too low for this to fit under our cabinets. That's disappointing.  I wish I would've thought to check the height, though I think I might have still chosen this model.  The color Meringue is a very nice color.  Virtually white, but with almost a pearlized matte finish.

I am a single guy and I have had this mixer for about 5 years now.  Believe it or not I use it all the time.  It is the best mixer in the world.  I have used it for all sorts of holiday gatherings.  It is really good for mixing up egg whites for egg nog punch at Christmas.The action you get with the mixer is great and mixes up anything like potatoes for twice baked potatoes.  It's one mixing blade but it goes back and forth to some scientifically devised motion.  I don't know what it is but it works great and anyone can use it. My recommendation is to get the extra attachments.  I have this book called the BBQ Bible and it had recipes that needed to have meat ground and sausages stuffed.  The attachments are perfect for this.  The best is all the attachments are easy to clean and dishwasher safe.Try it out.

Ever since the Ipod first came out, I was determined not to buy one.  Why?  Well, the main reason was that it didn't come with a replaceable battery.  I didn't want to be charged $50 just to replace it, when in other MP3 players, I could buy an extra one for half the price and do it myself.

Well, after a dismal experience with the Archos 504 (Note to people:  stay away from anything with that brand name, trust me on this.) I received the Ipod as an early Xmas present.  Though I was disappointed in having to downgrade (My Archos 504 was 160 GB), I was glad to have an MP3 player again.  At that point, the Archos had been in RMA land for about three months (2nd time in a year it went to that magical place).  And though I was anti-Ipod in the past, I decided to give this device a try.  Let's say I was EXTREMELY impressed--so impressed that when the Archos returned from it's RMA vacation, I didn't touch it again.

Even though the Ipod has about as much disk drive space as most laptop computers, it is extremely small and slim.  It's about half the size and width of the Archos 504.  It can easily fit into just about any pants or shirt pocket.  I didn't realize just how clunky my Archos was until I got the Ipod.  Also, there seems to be no issues with overheating or static with the hard drive.  I've heard it's not a traditional hard drive, but a 'solid state' one.  Well, anyway, I don't care what it is, all I know is that it's fabulous.  It's great not having to worry if the hard drive is going to freeze up on you any second now.

I wasn't sure about having one wheel and one button for all the controls.  It didn't seem intuitive to me, but actually I got the hang of it in about ten minutes.  It is very easy to figure out how to navigate through the player.  It doesn't really come with a manual (though it should) but you can access the manual on the Apple.com website.  I only had to look at it once.

About the battery, which is the main reason I didn't buy an Ipod in the first place--you can't change it, but for the most part, you don't need to.  I use it everyday (mostly to play music) with the backlight on for 2 seconds and I only have to charge it every 7-9 days.  Also, when I charge with the AC adapter, it takes only about an hour.  In this aspect, the Ipod blows Archos away when it comes to battery life (FIVE of my Archos batteries together lasted about the same amount of time as the Ipod battery and took about three hours to charge EACH.)

You can only sync music using Itunes.  I prefer to sync directly with the computer but the Itunes program is fairly easy to use and it's very easy to organize your music (once in a while the songs ID3 tags will be messed up in Itunes, but it's a very easy to fix them.)

Another fantastic thing with Ipod is that it plays standard formats without having to pay extra for 'plug-ins' (UH-HMMM, I'm talking to you, Archos.)  All songs on Itunes come in AAC format and video in m4v but Ipod also supports MP3 and MP4 and a variety of other formats right out of the box.  About playing videos, movies, etc.  the screen is a little small in my opinion for watching a full length movie (though I know people who have done it and say it's not bad) but for watching music videos it's awesome.  The screen is crystal clear--it's like having a tiny HDTV in the palm of your hand.  The Ipod also has various extras, like games, a clock, a stopwatch, etc.  I've tried all of these and they're all pretty cool little toys.

There are only a few things that I wish the Ipod had--one is more hard drive space (I don't know why they discontinued the 160 GB--I would have bought that one if I had gotten the Ipod myself) and two, is that the sound quality could be better.  It's not bad, most people would think it was pretty good, but being an audiophile, this area could use some improvement.  I noticed that on the songs that have a booming bass, the Ipod distorts the bass so much that the song is almost unlistenable.  The Ipod has various settings like most mp3 players have 'pop' 'electronic' etc., but I wish you could manual adjust the bass, treble & midline manually like you can on the computer or on a regular stereo.  Also, I have my music organized in separate A-Z files and unlike in my last two MP3 players, you can't actually see them, though they're there.  So, if I want to listen to a song in file W and I'm in file B, I have to scroll through all the songs to get to file W.  Also, you can't scroll backward from the first song to the last song--if you're in File B and want to go to File W, you have to flip through C,D, etc.  and not the shorter way A, Z, Y,.  In both of my old Mp3 players you could do that.  Sometimes if I scroll fast enough, the player will start 'flipping' through the files but this is hard to do.  Perhaps there is an easier way to do this, but I haven't figured it out yet.  Also, in shuffle mode, I'd love to have a preview of what song was up next on the list.  The Archos, and the Creative Zen Nomad Xtra from Eons ago both were able to do this.  I'm not sure why the Ipod doesn't have this feature.  Other than those minor things, the Ipod is incredible and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants an MP3 player that works reliably.  

So, to those afraid of the dark side, there's no need to be.  The dark side is your friend!

I think the product works well but probably won't stop my dog from barking.  He still barks once or twice, gets sprayed and then barks again a few minutes later.  It has stopped incessant barking which is why I give it 4 stars.  We have noticed that citronella spray does take on an odd odor when it sits on our dog for a while and now have to bathe him every week or two to get rid of the odor.

I absolutely loved Heroes season 1.  I liked Heroes season 2.  It is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be and it is still better than most shows on tv.  The problem was the writer's strike shortened the season so the episodes, plots, and solutions feel disjointed and rushed.  It's still very entertaining.  I loved the addition of Elle and I feel that Mohinder and Matt Parkman were used very well.  I also loved that the Bennets (Noah and Claire) were utilized a lot this season.  Adam made a great villain and Syler was pretty good.  The whole Shanti virous storyline was great and Mother Petrelli was downright creepy. 

The negatives:  The twins were boring, Nikki/Jessica barely had a role and Hiro spent WAY TOO MUCH TIME in Fuedal Japan.  I also wished that Monica and the New Orleans crew with Micah were given more to do.  Peter's storyline was annoying as well.

It's definately worth your time.  I like watching on DVD cause I can fastforward the twins and Hiro in Japan.  The rest of the show was great.

I'm looking forward to Season 3: Villains

I have an 11 yr. apricot toy poodle Peaches & a 1 yr. white & black Maltepoo Dolly.  Peaches being the older, not surprised when her eyes started weeping, but Dolly being so young I hoped to find something to help her.  Started giving both them Angel Eyes 11/21 & today is 12/24.  Didn't see much difference until about a week ago & extremely happy with the results.  Neither Peaches nor Dolly have the weepy eyes anymore.  I am going to cut back to every other day for a month & hoping to eventually cut back to the smallest dosage.  Would I recommend this product absolutely. I was a bit hesitant, but extremely pleased at the results.......Angel Eyes is expensive, but well worth it.

This film was excellent. The writing was divine by God. I can't believe it was low budget because the effects were excellent. The acting was excellent by the main characters. The firemen who assisted Kirk Cameron were questionable at times but good. Everything was excellent. I loved the film and everyone I know loved it. Many went back to see it at least twice. I think every teen, engaged couple and even married couples especially those having problems should see this film. I loved it. I saw it on large IMAX screen and LOVED it!! I am buying 2 copies of it. One for myself to share with others and one for my engaged daughter and her fiance'. She already saw it and loved it but this is for her to share with others who did not see it. LOVE IT!!! Sorry some reviews are not good. Can't understand it.

I saw this item several months ago and thought it seemed gimmicky, but I sprung for one when my old toaster quit working.  Oh. My. God.  I love this thing!  The egg comes out perfect, and on low setting an english muffin is just warmed, not toasted.  Just the way I want it.

Before this, breakfast consisted of a Diet Coke.  I never took the time to fix breakfast, and never bothered to stop and buy anything along the way to work either.  But this thing is perfect for my morning routine ... and weekend lunch ... and late night snack.

I purchased this camcorder for a vacation I just returned from.  This is a GREAT camcorder.  The learning curve is quick, very simple to use.  Two options of recording video, either on a memory card, or via mini-DVD.  The option of being able to pop out the mini-dvd and putting it into any DVD player is awesome.  No computer necessary.  

I had purchased 20 Memorex miniDVD+RW hoping/thinking they would work (via some other reviews on here), but they didn't--after formatting, "unsupported format" and no go. If there is a way to make them work, I'd love for someone to tell me how.  So I ran out to Target and bought 5 of the Sony mini's which worked, of course flawlessly--but at 3 times the cost.

We just watched some playback of video and are floored by the absolutely perfect color of the outdoor shots.  I'm really quite stunned at the quality.       

In any case, if you are like me a month ago and searching for a camcorder to buy, I say buy this one.  I would have been pleased at twice the price I paid.

All the reviewers seem to be men, so I thought you might like a woman's perspective:  My now-husband had this on the first day I met him & through our first several dates. I was completely mesmerized by this scent . . . or was it just him?  I would walk by men wearing this and be overwhelmened by thoughts of him.  Trust me, this scent is alluring, inviting, masculine, and extremely attractive.  That's why I buy it for him all the time - I never get tired of it & I hope he wears it forever.  Oh yeah, he likes it too!  Definitely worth a try!  As for the one negative review, it honeslty looked like the guy had a bad case of self-importance - who cares about whether the mood of the scent can be captured in one word?  I say, go for it - you won't be sorry.

I have always loved KitchenAid products, and this one does not disappoint. It is very lightweight, remarkably quiet, and does a wonderful, thorough job. I usually make smoothies with it as it is so much easier to clean than a blender; however it is wonderful for sauces as well. The detachable dishwasher safe blending head is a nice option, but a quick soapy rinse is sufficient most of the time. I would definitely buy this again, it is a great appliance and of course it doesn't hurt that it is very handsome!

I use this wheel with a Playstation 3, for Grand Turismo V Prologue. The force feedback is top quality allowing me to feel each and every bump, turn, spring compression, and crack. It does not also have a rumble system with takes away from driving on gravel or impacting another object. The independent gear shifter is very fun, but is also inconvenient to locate comfortably. The pedals are very nice having independent resistances to supply a true to life feeling. Overall the raw quality of this product has made it worthwhile despite the exurbanite price tag.

I understand what others are saying with there negative reviews, and I don't blame them for thinking that way. However I believe that they are taking a lot of things the wrong way. This review has spoilers to the book, please do not read any further if you have not yet read the book. 
She is not saying that teen pregnancy is the way to go, Bella and Edward are married adults, legal in every way. They are also not normal, any normal teenager who decides to get married and have a child with no regard to schooling and money needs a wake up call. Vampires have the money, plus all the time in the world to study everything in the world. 
I am a 24 year old mother, who did not want children. However, when I found out that I was pregnant, there was nothing that could make me choose not to have it, I fell in love instantly, the first kick was magic, proof that there was a little person in there. As far as Bella actually getting pregnant, so what? Who's to say that's not possible, I was very happy to read that she was. They are suck a strongly bonded family and a child just brings them more together. There is nothing wrong with Bella enjoying her honeymoon and wanting to stretch it out a little longer, that is human nature.
Jacob imprinting on the baby is a little weird, but it's not a sexual thing. After a little thinking about it it's fine. How much about these book are fantasy? Do you really understand vampires? shape-shifters? Are you in any place to judge them, that's like judging people by there religion. 
I LOVED this book, I couldn't be happier. This is how she invisioned the book ending from the start, this is what was always going to happen. I couldn't stop reading, I read for 13 hours straight yesterday. I hope that many other like this book and that you give it a chance even with the negative reviews.

After using this netbook daily for a month now, I can say that I really enjoy it.  Unlike my other laptops, I feel free to move around the house and use it wherever I want; it's like carrying a small book around.  Other laptops are just too heavy and big to do this and, at least the HP and dell's I've used, always needed to be plugged in because the batteries never last long enough.  I like how fast this netbook boots up (~40 seconds) and shuts down (~15 seconds), unlike all the other computers in my life that take forever. (I did go to a samsung netbook user group and change some setting like they recommended to speedup the start/stop times). The Atom processor works like a charm in this setup; forgot those hot running dual core-whatever chips.  The fan rarely comes on and I rarely even feel some warmth from the bottom of the netbook.  This is how computers should be.  Although I don't run graphics, cad/cam, or other complicated software, but who does.  For websurfing, this is it. This computer seems faster than my desktop 3ghz pentium.  Why is that?? Screen looks great with backlighting; keyboard is fine; touchpad is small but I haven't found the need to add a mouse. Speakers are minimally functional. I may need to buy another netbook for my wife so she can stop using the brick-like Dell laptop with the noisy fans - although it does keep her warm in the winter, once she finally gets it to bootup. Bottom line: buy it and enjoy.

This computer has exceeded all my expectations.  I put eeeXubuntu on it shortly after receiving it, and it even runs COMPIZ-FUSION!!!  Compiz-fusion isn't just a novelty demo on it either, it's completely usable and I run it all the time.  My kids love playing games or surfing the web on it (when I let them).  Boot-up time is very fast with the flash "hard-drive" and suspend to disk works really well (and is lightning fast compared to my old P4 1.6 GHz laptop with a 5400RPM hard-drive).

I just bought this juicer from Amazon and I can make a liter of juice in about a minute. The large chute means I can toss everything in whole and with the 1000 Watt motor this can juice a bag of carrots, several apples and an entire stalk of lettuce put in whole in seconds with the shredder spinning at 13,000 rpm.  I bought this for home and it would be fantastic for a health food restaurant of juice bar. For the fantastic quality and rugged construction you are get far more for your money than any other juicer on the market. It's worth a lot more than I paid for it and this juicer deserves more than 5 stars (far far superior to my top of the line  all stainless ACME juicer).  I make juice every morning and there is nothing so easy and fast to use.

This is the second Midwest crate we have owned.  The first one we had was for a large dog.  We still have it but no longer need it.  This little crate is awesome...the two doors come in very handy as you are not limited to where you can put it.  Also the divider is really handy when you first bring a puppy home.  It folds up really easy and is very easy to put up too.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it is a tad heavy, but I also know its a quality material, so I can't complain.  I have had some crates that are really tough to latch...this one is easy, but not too easy!    I would recommend this crate to everyone!

This is an excellent toaster oven. It does it all, easy to use, large interior volume (really a 4-slice toaster) and big enough for doing cookies/small pizzas.

After searching online and in numerous stores for a toaster oven that would replace the old B&D Spacemaker I'd all but given up on finding a decent unit in the sub-$100 range. The cheap ones were too small and looked like they last about a week and the Delongi and similar units were too expensive (its just a toaster, after all). I wasn't looking for a convection oven unit, this one just happened to be convection. It works very well. I would say "buy it," I highly recommend this toaster. Good price, great function, and great quality.

Stephenie Meyer writes yet again another amazing novel. It shows the love and compassion between the characters and shows us that true love can never die no matter what the price you have to pay to keep it. The ending only makes you anxious for Breaking Dawn. If you're anything like me, after you finish Eclipse you will not be able to leave Bella and Edward and have to read the series over again. For me I'm on my third time. I'm fairly certain I will be re-reading through the summer until Breaking Dawn is released...then I'll probably start over again! Thank you, Stephenie Meyer, for such a beautiful imagination!

This product is easy to use.  It is really economical since there is no wasted coffee or tea, you make it one cup at a time.  In our house, when we have guests over, some like Decaf and some like Regular, some like flavored coffee or others tea this eliminates making extra pots of coffee and tea that ends up being disgarded when all is not consumed. We have one at our office too.  Concept great for offices with many individules and many different tastes.

I plugged this WAP54G into my existing home network, slapped the Linksys PCMCIA card into my laptop, and I was up and running in unsecure mode immediately.  I then had no problem enabling MAC address filter, 128-bit WEP, and the SSID Change for security.  It was a piece of cake.  I flashed the firmware to the latest version and have had no issues.  I consistently link up at 36 Mbps to 54 Mbps.The thing screams.  I can't tell the difference between file transfers across my 100 Mbit home network and file transfers across this wireless network.  The speed and range are fantastic.I read the other reviews and I am surprised that this is the same product being reviewed.  I have been in the I/T industry for almost 10 years and I researched wireless security for a year before buying -- and this product is fantastic.

I really enjoyed Transformers. I'm not normally a big fan of toy-turned-film movies, but I have to say this film was awesomely entertaining.

The plot? A race of sentinent robots have invaded earth with the goal of locating an artifact which both the good (autobots) and the bad (decepticons) want. To locate this device, they enlist the aid of a teen boy.

What can I say, it was funny! I particularly liked the little dog, the male hacker character, and the scenes where the military is fighting the decepticons in the desert.

Downsides? The blonde teen girl who played the hacker who decoded the transformer language was very annoying. Her makeup was all smeary and her acting grated on my nerves.

This camera is a great way for a person with zero video experience to get started without a big investment.  The instruction guide is really short, because the device is so simple to use.

I plan on using the camera at my next family reunion and posting the video on our website.

I was one of those people that anxiously waited for each act as they were released.  Originally I was only in it for NPH, who is my favorite actor.  I ended up enjoying all 3 acts and have watched it several times since.  The songs are addictive and fun.  

I preordered both the DVD and CD and was surprised at the speed at which they were received!  I have since lent out the DVD to convert friends into the madness that is Dr. Horrible (It's two r's H O R R) before I borrowed it out I watched it again and again.  Commentary! is almost as fun as the movie itself.  The songs are also stuck in my head.  I don't dare sing them out loud for I fear the looks I would get in my small little town when I start belting out "No one wants to be Moist."  I would love to have the Commentary available on CD as well, but for now I'll just sing along at home!

First mixer arrived damaged. I called the manufacturer's "Hassle Free" consumer service number. This was a pleasant experience and I was sent a new mixer. Returning the damaged mixer was a nightmare. It was difficult to re-package the mixer, and UPS apparently hadn't been informed it was supposed to be picked up and returned. After a call to UPS (another frustrating experience), and a conversation with my local UPS delivery man, the mixer was returned. The new mixer works well and helps me make great bread.

I am so glad we took a chance and ordered this cat litter box.  It is much easier and, to me, more sanitary than the traditional litter box.  My favorite part is not having to touch the scoop (most of the time, there is an occasional clump that needs to be helped out) and being able to pull out the drawer and dump the contents in less than a minute!  The only gripe I have is that when you roll the box over there does tend to be some litter that leaks out even when all the latches are firmly in place.  Overall, a very good product.

My understanding is that Feliway products emulate feline pheromones and, in essence, trick cats into believing their territory has already been marked, so they feel relaxed and are less likely to mark their territory themselves. We have indoor cats, one of which is very skittish with strangers, the other of which developed a habit of spraying after a recent move. All the Feliway products seem to work pretty well. When we use the spray before company comes over, the cats are noticeably more relaxed and outgoing. As is reasonable to expect, the plug-in diffusers take some time to work because (1) the air has to become saturated with the solution, and (2) it takes some time for cats to be reconditioned to a change in their environment. So the long-term effect occurs gradually, but now if we ever run-out of diffuser solution or remove the plug ins for more than a day or two we definitely notice a difference in the cats' anxiety levels, and the 'sprayer' (who we jokingly refer to as Sir Pees-A-Lot) is more likely to have an 'accident'. It helps to use these products in conjunction with using a cat-attract product in the litter box. My only complaint is that the diffuser refills are suppose to last ~6 weeks, and in our current apartment they last only about 4-4.5 weeks, which gets kind of expensive. We previously lived in a more humid climate, and they seemed to last longer there.

I really wanted a podless single cup coffee maker, and this seems to be the only one out there.  So was it worth the money?  I think so, and it brews a good cuppajoe but there are some caveats.  

- 95% of the coffee cup brews fast, but the last 5% is excruciatingly slow.  Unfortunately, that means you will grab your cup while the filter is still dripping.  Fortunately, there's no burner to turn the drops into crispy tar.

- If you use really fresh coffee, the basket can bubble over and send grounds into the fresh water chamber.  Usually if you're careful and pack the grounds down in the bottom, you can avoid it.

- The brewing mug has a thermos-like vaccuum insulating layer of air, but since the top is plastic, it's easy to get water caught in between.  If you wash the cup by hand and don't immerse it, you can avoid that too.

Anyway, if you like 1.5 cups of coffee in the morning, this maker will pay for itself in filters and electricty you save.  Not a bad thing, that.

As an avid reader of the Iron Man comics, I was excited but also very scared that this movie would flop.  While Robert Downey is not the biggest name in Hollywood, he plays the part perfectly and I was greatly impressed by how he portrayed Iron Man so well.  The humor works well for this film also. It's well-written and has a great cast.

What impressed me the most was the CGI! They're breath-taking, but aren't distracting enough to let you miss the finer points of this movie.
In conclusion, while not perfect, Iron Man lives up to its hype and my expectations as a reader of the comic.

This review is from: Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition) (DVD)

      



I rented Iron Man on DVD yesterday, and I had a chance to check it out last night. I had high expectations for this film---I expected more, a lot more, a hell of a lot more. Okay, it was a summer movie. Critics raved so much over Iron Man that I couldn't wait to see what all the fuss was about. 

My first gripe against Iron Man was the time it took to get to the action: about 40 minutes. There was too much exposition before the actual fireworks, and those fireworks were over in a blink. My second gripe against Iron Man was its conflict: weapons save lives, and weapons take lives. I wasn't expecting a brain-f**k, but I was expecting something more sophisticated. My third gripe against Iron Man was Gwyneth Paltrow. She's out of this world, and I would like to have seen more of her. 

On the plus side, Robert Downey Jr. invests more personality in a superhero than I am used to seeing. He plays the cold arrogant billionaire role with ease. Downey plays billionaire industrialist Tony Stark, who's the antithesis of everything heroic. Tony grew up as a child prodigy. At age four, he built his first circuit board. At age six, he built his first engine. At age seventeen, he graduated from MIT. And as CEO of the largest and wealthiest defense contractor in the world, Tony Stark has zero morals. He gambles, he drinks, he's irresponsible, and he's a womanizer. 

Tony pitches a new missile system, the Jericho, to the military in Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. There, a band of terrorists hijack Tony's Humvee. The terrorists overwhelm Tony's military entourage. The confrontation is furious and swift. Hours later, Tony awakens in a dark cave. His body is wet with sweat and blood, his clothes are torn, and he has a huge plug--an electromagnet--protruding out of his chest. This magnet keeps him alive by pulling the shrapnel embedded his chest away from his heart. Earlier, during the terrorist siege, an exploding bomb splintered and planted those splinters in Tony's chest.

The terrorists torture Tony; they dunk his head underwater. Then they show him why they kidnapped him in the first place. They lead him out of the dark cave and into the light. Tony sees an enormous cache of stockpiled weapons--weapons manufactured by his company. The terrorists stockpile these weapons to use against American soldiers. Now the terrorists want Tony's help: they want Tony to build the Jericho missile system for them to use against American soldiers. The terrorists promise to release Tony if he cooperates. But Tony has other ideas. He builds an armored battle-suit equipped with flame-throwers. He escapes. 

Back home in the U.S., the press mobs Tony. He's sober.  He saw terrorists use his weapons to kill American soldiers; now, he wants to shut down the weapons development division of his company. He wants to use his company to make the world a better place. Tony's plans embitter his guardian and vice president Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who has his sights set on selling the Jericho missile system to the U.S. government. The action starts from this point of the movie. 
 
Like Batman, Iron Man has no natural powers; this implies that some heroes are made. The exterior insulation of Tony Stark's vanity and ego are the perfect counterpoint to Iron Man's cold titanium shell. Overall, Iron Man's a solid movie. It's worth buying, though it's not as good as Verhoeven's Robocop.

I like this toaster because it fits with my retro-themed diner kitchen.  It stays cool.  It is glossy candy-apple red.  It's cute :)  It is a little wide - definately takes up more space than my $[...] special.  It stays pretty cool.  Bagels, muffins, waffles and Italian bread fit just fine in it.

The only thing I don't like is the digital 'display'.  There's a knob to select the toasting 'level' but its kind of cheesy because the digital display isn't quite as high-tech as it appears.  The knob has numbers on it and as it spins around, the numbers slide across a little light inside the toaster, making it appear digital.  I would have preferred a printed dial instead of a cheap digital-imposter ;p

Being new at this I made sure I was buying the best product. It arrived today and of course I had to try it out right away. I've never waxed before so I had no idea what to expect. I was able to do all of both my legs with only a little pain! Of course it didn't feel GOOD but once I got used to the tingling feeling it wasn't too bad. 
And then came the armpits.....It was very painful. But I was very motivated! I found that stretching my arm as high as I could helped. I also found that using a mirror was easier than looking directly at my armpit. And now that I battled through it, I have perfectly smooth armpits! There is some redness but I'm told it will be gone tomorrow. 
I am definetely glad I bought this product. It worked awesome and didn't pinch my skin once. Even as a first timer!
The power cord is plenty long, the light works fine, it's easy to operate and it did exactly what I got it for....to take all the hair away.

Considering that I remember being just thrilled when Iomega ZipDisks came out - they held 10 megs, I think - I should be just paralyzed with joy that it's possible to get a 500GB portable hard drive for less than $200. In red, no less. The eGo does have a few areas for improvement but all in all it's a good buy. 

First, the instructions provided are a tad minimalists and the page numbers don't correspond to the table of contents. (Yes, I notice these things.) It's a little silly to include the vital information that the eGo needs to be formatted to work with PCs in the "using the drive" section instead of in the "Quick install" section. And that formatting thing is problem number two.

Unlike the five other portable hard drives I've purchased in the last 2 years, the eGo needs to be formatted before it can be used on a PC. I'm not sure why this is or whether this actually a good thing. It took over 5 hours to format the 500GB drive I purchased. I can't complain since it turns out I didn't need to use the eGo immediately and now I know how to use the Computer Manager on Vista. But if you need to use a hard drive out of the box and you're using a PC you should look elsewhere.

Those two relatively minor problems aside, this is a sleek, stylish portable drive that actually feels like it could survive a fall from a desk. The ability to use either USB or FireWire is a nice bonus. It's good to see that Iomega is still in the game and still producing durable products that have a unique design sensibility without being pretentious.

I don't see well and it is much easier to use than a traditional scale where I have to bend over and squint to see the numbers.

The body fat meter is great, I think it is much more meaningful than just body weight alone. 

We checked the scale and body fat readings against those at our gym and they were pretty close, so it seems to be pretty accurate.

I have flown flight simulator since the first version that came out for Apple in the early 80's, but I have always used joysticks, the latest being Microsofts ForceFeedback 2.  I've always felt I had good control of the airplane, and it felt like really flying, but it just doesn't compare to te experience of having a real yoke and throttle.  I've always worked hard a keep the plane balanced to keep it at altitude or do turns without changing altitude, but with the yoke it's not problem at all, and maintaining level of descent on landing is a breeze with the throttle now.  As for the product itself, it is good quality, easy to install, and I love the mode switch on the back of the yoke's right handle.  It means I get triple amount of buttons as you can assign three different functions to the same key, and then switch between these modes by simply turning the mode switch.  I've set mode one to handle the radio stack and to handle ATC commands.  Mode 2 I've set to handle all functions of the autopilot, and mode 3 is set for flight functions like gear, flaps, brakes, trim, etc.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants the real feeling of flying even though it's just a simulation.

I put electrical tape all over the front of this router to cover the many lights that blink and pop. I still woke up in the night thinking the living room (which I can see from my bed) was on fire. A test button which would show all the pretty lights for 5 minutes and then turn them off would be very appreciated for us that like the dark. 

Other than the light pollution, this router has worked like a champ for 3 years. I set it up w/o an owners manual in &lt; 10 minutes. (I got the router for free when a neighbor was moving.) The Netgear website has many helpful guides. Just search the website for this model number if you lose your manual. The guide I found most helpful was "Using WPN824, WGR614, or WGT624 Routers as an Access Point." My mistake: I had to hook back up the cable modem with an Ethernet cable to get specs I needed!! SO! It would probably be helpful to print out this page while you are still connected to the Internet.

For an error free set up, shutdown everything: modem, router and computer. Use an Ethernet cord to connect the wireless router to your computer. (Yep that is right - to set up a wireless router, the first time you connect to it you need to run a wire from it to your computer.) Leave the cable modem unconnected. Now power up the wireless modem. When it stops blinking, start the computer and open your Internet web browser. Enter the router's default IP address in your web browser - as discribed on the guide from the Netgear website. 

From here you'll have to figure out your needs (DHCP, WEP, IP settings for laptops, SSDI setup, etc.) and customize it for your network. There are general directions on the guide from Netgear website. Configuing routers is not rocket science but it can be confusing. I recommend you set your router to the lowest security levels - and write the settings down. Create the SSDI (or Network Name, Location Profile, WLAN Settings, or whatever euphemism your wi-fi connection software calls it) on your computer using similar settings. If your router had the IP address 192.168.1.10 then your computer will need a different number in the same neighborhood: 192.168.1.20. It can't (repeat: can not) have the same IP address as any other piece of equipment on your network.

Once you have the computer and the wireless router talking to each other wirelessly, then shut down everything again and now connect the cable or DSL modem. The following sequence is important forever: boot the modem. When its lights stop flashing, boot the wireless router. When its lights calm down, then try to connect to the network and then the Internet with your computer. 

Once you know the network and its Internet connection is working then you can add WEP, no broadcast mode, etc. -- to give you the sense of security you think you'll need. You'll have to make the change on the wireless router and on the SSID profile on your computer. Do these changes one at a time - and test, then reboot modem and the router and test again. Yes. It is important to go through the full reboot protocol each time: changes on your network may be not compatable with the cable company's network. If your modem is not able to latch on, it is easier to fix one thing than figure out twenty what-ifs. 

OK That is some of the better things I have learned about wireless networks by trial and error. Oh! Interference! If your neighbor has a wireless router and you live in an apartment complex, you may want to run the router on a different channel than them. I run on channel 6 - my neighbors run on 2 and 11. For best results, don't plug routers or modems on the same circuit breaker as a light switch with a dimmer nor things with electro-magnetic motors: fans, blender, vacumm cleaners, elevators, garage door openers.... Stay at least 6-8 feet away from your electrical panel. Keep the wireless router 5-6 feet away from Bluetooth devices or wireless phones to avoid interference with your phones. Mirrors and metal (steel doors, tin roofs, i-beams, cast iron bathtubs) reflect the signal back. I keep my router and modem plugged into a surge suppessor - but I am the last house on the power line on my street and we get bad storms here. 

That's about it. I have not called tech support or tried to roast marshmallows on the fire. The router is small - about the size of a good beach book. I have it stuck on the wall in the living room (in the center of my house) with "Command" double-sided tape. I live in a small house but do not have any interference from this device or with this device. But it is purposely located away from the wireless doorbell, my cell-linked-with-bluetooth to DECT wireless home phone base station, the electric litter box and the many small yet powerful kitchen appliances. I stuck it on the wall near a window and bought drapes wide enough to cover it. It is still on fire but muted enough so I can sleep. 

I use it for a bit of gaming, but mostly work and websurfing. I have a Thinkpad laptop and a Time Warner Cable modem and Road Runner Max. I download and upload many large blocks of data and graphics. It works very fast and I get a very good to excellent signal, inside, on the deck, out in the back yard. 

Best of luck to you.

Breakfast time at our house was usually a bit of a scramble (and I don't just mean the eggs).  My fantasy envisioned a trusty maid who would have hot toast, eggs and sausage waiting for us, while we greeted the day with smiles instead of "hurry-hurry" admonitions.

	Turns out my fantasy wasn't so far off after all when I found this Back To Basics Egg & Muffin Toaster.  This is the coolest electric I've ever seen.  Would you believe this mini marvel toasts two slices of bread (or English muffin or croissant), cooks an egg, and warms sausage all at the same time?  Well, it does, from a push of the start button to done in four minutes!

	Wide toasting slots accommodate the bread of your choice, and it's equipped with an automatic shut-off.  It can be used for all three of the functions or simply one (but what's egg without sausage?)

	It's sleek and black measuring  some  8" high and 15" wide with a detachable crumb tray, indicator light, plus meat warming tray.  Not only that, but it's fun to use.  Now, kids can get breakfast for me - that, friends, is really a good morning!

It's more about these than laser guns and robots. I can't say enough about how much I love this show. The drama is gripping. The religion and politics in the show keep me guessing as to what it's advocating, if anything, and if the show creators think it would be applicable for today. Sounds geekish, I know, I am THAT into it. This show is not science and technology oriented at all, and some people might complain about the seeming lack of dazzling technological concepts here. This show is very fast paced, and it seems like every single sub plot grabs my attention - for me personally, there are no groaner plot lines, or amazingly even groaner events! The only one is where someone says they are a crack rifle shot and the rifle has a laser pointer on the top of it. See! I have to get that specific to find something stupid! Anyways, I love this show. Go buy it.

These are just like the original white strips in terms of how they work. Except they say to use these once a day for 14 days instead of twice a day for 7 days; although it says that you can use them twice a day. They are much thicker than regular white strips and go on your teeth like how I would imagine duct tape would stick to teeth. Because the white strips are so thick they do not bend around your teeth well. That is my only gripe. But to me the best part of them is you aren't left with a mouthful of the whitening goop when you are done as with regular white strips.

This review is from: Doubt [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)

      



At a Catholic school circa 1964, doubt has begun to enter a world of certainty.  Times are changing and the Catholic Church is becoming more liberal.  This sets the stage for a battle between principal Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) and Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman).  Sister Aloysius suspects Father Flynn of inappropriate behavior with a student (Joseph Foster II) on very circumstantial evidence and makes it her crusade to remove him from his position.  As she says, she has no proof, but she has her certainty.

It is this certainty which seems to make her a monster, as she dismisses each bit of information or alternate interpretation of events that would cast doubt on her belief.  But this would not be such a rich film if writer / director John Patrick Shanley had made it that simple.  The viewer is never given satisfactory ground for completely siding with either the sister or the father.  While it is very clear that Sister Aloysius is very rigid, cold, and judgmental, it is also possible that she is right.  I admire the way Shanley encourages us to think about the issues raised and draw our own conclusions, which is why I was very disappointed in the final moments of this film, in which Shanley makes explicit a element of his theme that would have been better left understated, ending his script on a rather jarring note.  Amy Adams, who plays the young sister caught in the middle of this battle, and Viola Davis, who plays the boy's mother, also deserve mention for their powerful performances.

OK, so I'll tell you this gadget really does the trick and removes gobbs of hair! When I received my shipment, I immediately used it on all 3 of my dogs and it didn't remove much hair at all. After reading the instructions, it specifically mentioned using the furminator AFTER bathing/grooming. So, I took the dogs to the groomers and gave it another round. What a difference! I felt bad when I left the park we were at because it looks like I left my 3 dogs there with all the hair on the ground! It has now been 2 days since, and I really do see a difference with the shedding problems. I highly recommend this tool, especially if you hate shedding as much as I do!

First of all, this netbook is worth every penny for those who seek a portable solution with a long battery life. Before buying MSI Wind I researched all the current netbook offerings and after several days of reading user and magazine reviews concluded this one provides best value for the money--better than Apple Air, eee Pc, even Lenovo. While solid state drives are theoretically more reliable as they have no moving parts, the performance of the ones that find their way into cheap netbooks is surprisingly sub-par to conventional hard drives (such as the one found in this netbook). However, do not mistake this for a full-fledged laptop. This is a netbook and as such its scope and function is different than that of a laptop. So, if you are in a need of a netbook, I think this is the best one can get currently on the market.

If I had to complain, it would have to be that:

1) my netbook came with a sentelic touchpad that has a limited set of functionality when compared to the ubiquitous synaptics found in most laptops (e.g. it supports tap-click and scrolling by holding a finger in top-right and bottom-right corners for scrolling up and down respectively). Some users reported they did get a synaptics touchpad so this aspect is a hit and miss. That being said, the touchpad works just fine and as long as you are not a "power user" commonly utilizing two- or three-finger gestures, you should be perfectly fine.
2) The netbook is so light, with the screen propped open all the way it tends to tip backwards which has in my case resulted in the netbook falling from my sofa. The good news it still works fine and there are no noticeable blemishes.
3) In Linux (see below for more info) some dialogs/windows have minimum size of 700+ pixels which makes it cumbersome to read on a 1024x600 screen.

OPERATING SYSTEM CONSIDERATIONS
Like Asus Eee PC, this netbook is also available with Linux (although AFAIK not in US). However, the Linux flavor it comes with has been reported to not work as well as some of the more recent distributions, such as the Ubuntu 8.10.

The Although XP does the job for the most part (assuming you wish to spend another couple hundred $ getting Microsoft productivity software or better yet use one of the free alternatives, such as Open Office), as a long-time user of Linux platform I installed Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid (for the uninitiated, this is a flavor of Linux) and was literally blown away by the fact that practically everything worked out of the box. In my 10+ years of using Linux I've never had this good of an experience installing Linux on a portable. If you do decide to install Linux, however, pay close attention to the wireless card you get, as mine was entirely different from all the online documentation, so it required a driver that was not included with Ubuntu. One simple download and I was ready to go. Overall, if you are brave enough to take a plunge and try Linux, I think this is the portable to do it on. Not only does it provide better user experience than the aging XP, but it also includes all the productivity software you will ever need in a netbook. If you do decide to use Linux, please pay special attention to fine-tuning power-saving features as the bios by default has rather aggressive settings for the spin-down of the HD which (unless configured properly) may significantly shorten its lifespan. For more info on this last feature look into laptop-tools and hdparm.

OTHER CONSIDREATIONS
One rather cute feature is with the latest bios you get to overclock the netbook by up to 24%. There is even a reserved key/icon for this feature(Fn+F10). Please note for this to work you do need latest bios update and you need to enable overclocking in the bios. Finally, the overclocking only works when you are running off of AC power (which makes sense as you would want to conserve power when running off battery anyhow). The crazy part is this is a feature supported by the manufacturer and it truly does deliver the 24% boost in cpu performance (as measured by the SuperPI cpu benchmark).

Overall, I love the portable and I use it regularly next to my 17" Apple Macbook Pro.

This is what I wanted. The keyboard is very small, so if your hands are large like mine, you'll not want this for your primary computer unless you plug in a full-sized keyboard. (I can use the keyboard, but it's easy to hit double keys.) There is no CD/DVD-ROM drive, so I wound up buying a USB external drive. With so much done via the Internet, this may not be necessary for some folks. So far it seems to do its job well, and it is extremely light-weight and small. For my application, the "small" part was absolutely necessary.

Have never been a big vegetable eater.  With this very reliabled juicer, am juicing vegetables daily!!!  It's probably more juicer than one person needs, but am sure it will last me a lifetime!  

Somewhere in my Internet surfing picked up the idea of not having to "wash" a juicer everyday.  I do rinse it in very hot water immediately after using it for a fast clean up, and then wash in dishwasher once a week.  Am juicing kale, spinach, cucumbers, green onions, garlic, carrots, etc., and always 1/2 apple for sweetness (vary my vegetables to avoid developing allergies).  Add Flaxseed Oil for the omega 3's.

This is by far the most important purchase I've made for myself in years.  All others purchases of jewelry, clothing, vehicles, etc. do not compare to the life sustaining nourishment my body will experience because of this juicer.  Recently read where vegetable calcium absorbs better/faster than dairy calcium  absorption.  Important for someone like myself with osteopenia.

First the good.
The feedback is strong and prescise. Very smooth steering and it will immerse you into the game. NFS Most Wanted and GTR 2 are great with this wheel. The shifter is awesome, although you do not want to beat it up. A ginger approach makes it work best. The pedals are very solid with good tension, although you have to have very small feet if you are going to use all three. I use my clutch for the brake forgetting the middle pedal.
Now for the bad.
The clamping system works, but for how long? Plastic screws are only going to last so long, and you have to really tighten them for the wheel to stay put. There are mounting nuts on the bottom, but are you going to drill 2 holes through your desk? Microsoft has a superior clamp in my opinion. The shifter works well, and I am sure it will last with care. Be nice to it though. The pedals are to close together. Other than that, they are perfect.
Overall, I highly recommend this wheel. For the money you can't get a better wheel.

This review is from: Slumdog Millionaire [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)

      



Frantic and pitiless, profane yet eloquent, flush with the ability to create laughter out of unspeakable situations, Slumdog Millionaire takes its simple message--what doesn't kill you yields the most lasting education--and weaves a riveting masterpiece about the life of a boy who makes it in a world of delicious contradictions.

This is trademark Danny Boyle stuff (of "Trainspotting" and "The Beach" fame). His stunners have left no doubt that he can poke into a subculture and emerge with a fresh new look at it. But Slumdog goes one better. It is pitch-perfect in its take, but also perhaps his most accessible endeavor thus far.

The narrative couches a crisp homage to Bollywood. Funky A.R.Rehman music. A largely Indian crew. Crisp acting, even from kids, in fact especially from kids. And then the gloriously larger-than-life thematic flourishes: poor folks at the behest of a cruel world, friend pitted against friend, brother against brother--and the most tried and tested one of all-- a rags to riches cavalcade of an underprivileged hero who makes it amid impossible odds. It's hero-giri alright.

But where it departs from Bollywood is Simon Beaufoy's screenplay. It's dazzling. Professional Indian reviewers have been overly delicate in their reference to Vikas Swarup's novel that inspired the film, "Q & A". The book was an enjoyable read, but the film merely borrows the central premise and that's basically it. There is a scene towards the end with our two protagonists at a train station where a trick of reverse cutting will tell a discerning viewer just how innovative the thinking behind the screenplay truly is--that is such a sweet, affectionate shot that it moistened my eyes.

It's a bummer that such fuss and to-do has been made about how this film projects an unfair image of the country. Guess the confusion arises when established reviewers such as Roger Ebert decide to call it a testament to "the real India". I wouldn't be so pedantic. To me, the film carries no such delusions of grand purpose. It's a gleeful entertainer. A breakneck story of one individual from *one* aspect of an astonishingly multifaceted country. To that extent, it covers its subject with addicting vigor and focus. It's witty, gritty, and--for suitable values thereof--sh*tty.

To address some petty cavils:

(1) The use of English by the characters. It's a British production, what did you expect. There's a world outside a specific country. We call it "International Cinema". Bet there will be local dubbed versions for those who truly desire it that way (now that the film's multitude of nominations have drawn it far away from a SlumUnderdog status).

(2) The disrespectful use of the word "dog" in the title. This smacks of nothing but ignorance of colloquialisms. "Word up, dawg", for instance? People forget that an insult becomes an insult only when we choose to let it become one.

(3) Finally, the unfairness of how it depicts India in a manner that might give people the WrongIdea. To these Einsteins may I point out that the baffling kaleidoscope we call India makes it pretty hard to ever get the RightIdea to begin with?

What level of dimness would make a viewer go seeking a wholesome view of a country in *one* film? Just because "The Godfather" showed with such pizzazz one specific aspect of the American underworld, should we infer that every American is a gun-slinging gangster? "Crouching Tiger.." may have sketched a mellifluous perspective of China, but I don't recall anyone thinking that our Chinese colleagues fly from tree to tree on their way to work. And so on.

It's a movie, not a national treatise. Sure, it depicts poverty. So? Those who have expanded their horizons beyond Spiderman Part 38 will know that countless movies have been made in the last decade alone that depict hard times in *every* country. At any rate, reality is nothing but a collectively accepted notion. I'd say Slumdog is as equidistant from reality as, say, Bollywood's gigantic palaces (yeah, we live that way) or the scantily-clad "item girls" gyrating on snow-capped mountains.

To people who have yet to see this upbeat thriller: ignore all the Pavlovian drivel. It's a delectable film, brimming with fun and suspense, and it has its moral spine exactly where it belongs. With one sweeping flourish it will break your heart, then heal it, then send you packing with music. Literally.

Don't miss it.

This stand mixer is a god-send.  I 100% agree with the reviewer that said this is what American-Made means.  I wish more things we all spend our hard earned money on, provided this much satisfaction.  KitchenAid has been a staple of the kitchen for so many years, and their stand mixers have become somewhat of a status item.  All that aside, it stands up to all the food thrown into it, and makes unbelievable creations.  It is well worth the extra money and has many versatile options.  This model is perfect for the home.

I have an aussie mix and hair and matting is a perpetual problem.  The Furminator has helped tremendously.  My dog even enjoys the brushing with it.

These sheets are amazing. I don't mean to cut them short by any means, but the reason for my 4 stars instead of 5 is due to not washing them yet. I just moved and they have been in packaging . I took them out felt them,judged them according to color (they match very nicely and were just what I was looking for) They are extremely soft and have a silky feel. I am not sure they are as strong as the Damask Pinson sheet set I had purchased before, but that is just going by the feel of them. They have more thread count and that's where the softness comes in.I love them and am more than satisfied, by feel,look,price, and above all comfort level.

My wife and I have watched this movie documentary a few times ever since it came out several months ago, and we're so glad that it's having such an exposure on a massive scale. You could not ask for a bigger platform than 'Oprah' and 'Larry King Live' to talk about these principles. People are responding in a huge way because these are truths everybody 'knows' but just 'forgot.' That's why it's called 'The Secret,' even though it's a secret that's been staring us in the face all along. The Law of Attraction is a natural law just like the law of gravity or any other law of physics. What this movie does is just remind everyone that we can be more conscious and deliberate in using this law to our benefit, instead of meandering through life constantly bumping into things we have attracted unconsciously. This knowledge is very self-empowering and, as attested to by several participants in the Oprah show, can lead to dramatic life changes.

What you put your attention on grows. Focus on what you want, not on what you don't want. If you don't know what you want, make a list of things you don't want and then write down the exact opposite. Simple enough. But the tricky part is the allowing versus resisting. Focusing on what you want and feeling joyful/grateful about it, and focusing on what you want but feeling the absence or lack of it, are two different things. The former is an 'allowing' energy that will manifest what you want, while the latter is a 'resisting' energy that will manifest further lack. The nature and quality of the emotional energy is crucial. (For more details about how to navigate the Emotional Guidance System, I highly recommend the Abraham-Hicks material, e.g. 'The Law of Attraction' by Jerry and Esther Hicks.)

Now, when we say focus on what you want, that could be anything. While most people would put material wealth at the top of their list (which is perfectly fine, for the law does not judge), I like James Ray's definition of Harmonic Wealth, i.e., a person's true wealth is measured by how fulfilled they feel in these 5 areas of life: physical, financial, intellectual, relational and spiritual. 

Anyway, watch this movie. And give away copies as gifts to friends and family.

My daughter has been sleeping in Halo Sleepsacks since she got too big for swaddling (4-5 months), and she absolutely loves it. As soon as I begin sliding her arms into it, she starts yawning on cue and preparing herself for sleep. I'm thrilled that Halo makes an XL so that we can continue the sleepsack tradition through her second year! My only negative comment is that the zippers seem to wear out before anything else. They don't break or anything, mind you, but just that they gradually get trickier and trickier to maneuver. Obviously not a big point, since I'm still buying more of them two years later. :-)

This is a wonderful piece that brings the period -and the man- vividly to life. My 17-year-old daughter joined me in anxiously awaiting each installment, for which I expressly ordered HBO. I have only two minor complaints, which I will address further below.  The portrayals were superbly acted, and the entire piece contained subtlety & restraint while giving the viewer plenty to "chew on". Each evocative scene unfolded with nuance & earthy context, formed by realistic dialogue. There was some use of edgy cinematography, with unexpected angles and tight -often off-center- closeups, but the effect usually works well. It forces the eye onto a new detail.

The conflicting emotions of this very real man can actually be supposed through these reenactments. I love that Mr McCullough's book was the basis for this adaption. His finely wrought depiction of a world turned upside down for Adams and the surrounding subjects is so realistic as to be stepped into, and this beautifully-made film does it justice. The locations and realism in living conditions are not to be missed.

The two overlooked areas of this project that were somewhat distracting:
It was sometimes difficult to know how much time had passed or where a scene was taking place. The aging of characters occasionally seemed inconsistent -most noticeably with the children. A simple caption introducing a location or year would have been appreciated. Still, these flaws do not prevent my rating this with 5 stars. We need more like this.

While not a blockbuster-mentality offering, I do feel that a viewer who has some interest in history, visually stunning scenery, and a decent vocabulary will find this biopic riveting. The tension and plot of human condition is palpable throughout. No car(riage) chase scenes necessary.

Together again, Edward and Bella are completely inseparable, much to the chagrin of Bella's father, who would like her to take things a little more slowly, lest she just get her heart broken again.  Edward and Bella take a trip to visit Bella's mother, which Bella finds out is really just an excuse to get Bella out of town as it becomes clear that danger is once again present.  More drama between Edward and Jacob, more Cullen-y goodness.

After scoffing at these books for quite some time, I am now forced to admit that I am a complete addict (even if I am an addict who still occasionally scoffs at the books ;) ).  I first started reading the series because I teach ninth grade and every year I try to read one book that my students are all talking about, as a gesture of good will.  And thus the insanity begins.  I liked Eclipse more than the second book in the series because having Edward around was a big improvement.

These are the first high thread count sheets I've ever owned, as typically they cost so much money. I got these around Christmas and they are all that's been on the bed since. I have washed them weekly without fail and they look brand new still. They are so soft, especially compared to the Target sheets I've always had in the past- and they even fit thick mattresses! It's a fantastic deal. I plan on getting 3 more sets so I can rotate through them and kave mroe variety for color. The one complaint I have is that they are ALWAYS wrinkled, but they are under a blanket, so no one can see that anyhow. Also, note that the "white" color is more of a soft or winter white- not off white or ivory, but not a brilliant white either.

I confirmed with Canon and they said it records at 1440x1080, not 1920x1080.  They expect the HDTV to upconvert it the rest of the way when viewed directly from the camcorder via HDMI.

I had this, on my Wish List, for a while.  Finally, I had to buy it.  I was only content with my SanDisk 8 GB Cruzer Micro USB 2.0 Drive with U3 SDCZ6-8192-A11 (retail packaging), with "U3" technology.  That drive allowed me to store a lot of info, college projects, research, and to save large files for various Operating Systems....  However, being a Tech Geek, I was drooling over the 32 GB flash / thumb drive, and I am very happy with the product.

I researched, for a while, due to the fact that prices were higher when I began drooling over the 32 GB availability, and the Corsair drive was my choice after reading reviews.

The drive arrives clean, and ready for possibilities.  My Cruzer drive has the U3 system built in...which is nice...but also can be a pain, on older computers, some public computers, or computers with slow memory.

On the other hand, having all of your email, browser settings, and favorite programs in your pocket is wonderful.

I have read several books, about how to create a Linux /home file, on a USB drive -- Knoppix Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips and Tools, for an ENCRYPTED /home file, to run "in Persistent mode," with a Linux "Live CD," such as Knoppix, or Ubuntu 8.04 DVD --and I have read about how to hack a Linux OS into a USB drive.... Hacking Ubuntu: Serious Hacks Mods and Customizations (ExtremeTech)...so the possibilities seemed limitless....with more GB !

Although I may use the above books, to later create an encrypted /home file, for USB "persistent mode" (carry your Desktop, anywhere....except across Borders, according to the news) /home file directory, for now I have simply setup an easy solution to duplicating a U3 type of setup.

You can purchase this 32 GB drive, then go to Portable Apps (on the web), and install the "Suite" package, then update the programs, and install new programs.  You can even import your email into the drive, and it works with multiple Operating Systems (see Portable Apps, for a list of supported OSes).

So, if you like the idea of U3 type technology, but you want more GB, you can purchase this drive, and use Portable Apps to turn the drive into a pocket Office, or organizer.

If you want to really Geek out, and you do not cross Borders (where Homeland Security is taking laptops and thumb drives), you can put your entire Desktop environment (Linux), in your pocket...then boot with a Live CD, and save data without leaving any traces on the machine that you boot from.

Either way, this drive gives nearly unlimited possibilities, until Uncle Sam takes it away from you...or hires you to teach him how you tweaked it.

As a fantastic bonus, instead of providing a small, old school extension, Corsair provides a fancy, sleek, LONG, "new fangled" extension that works very well, and gives you a lot of flexibility and reach.  Extensions are important, especially for office workers, and more so when the PC units are on the floor.  Who wants to get their nice dress slacks dirty?  Simply plug in the fancy, long extension, and you can have access, no matter where the USB ports are located, or what weird angle (Dell) they are placed.

Furthermore, the drive comes with a nice cap, and a durable lanyard, with a strong clip.  One loop through the beltloop, and if the drive falls out of your pocket....no worries.

I recently moved into an office without on-site Internet access. I had to walk over the another building (about 200 feet away) to use the local network. I was thinking about setting up a wireless bridge to extend the wifi signal to my office building. But thanks to the DIR-655 and its extended range, I don't need to. To my surprise, my laptop detected a wireless signal and could connect near my window. I set up a D-Link range extender in that window, the office now has wifi coverage. I'm getting throughput equal to about 80% of the company's T1 line speed.
 The DIR-655 is in another building, over 200 feet away, in a closed cabinet away from windows!  The range of this router eliminated the need for additional hardware.

  Edit: After 30 days use, the DIR-655 still works as described above, but I need to add some qualifications.  A wireless signal at such a long range is very vulnerable to interference.  The DIR-655 attempts to search out a channel with the least interference, but this does not always work perfectly.  Sometimes after a power flicker I lose the connection, until I enter the Setup utilities and change the channel number.  Cordless phones that use 2.4 Ghz frequency are a likely culprit.
  As for any wireless router, the use of WEP or WPA security is recommended. The bigger the range, the more important it is.

I have been using the wireless fence for a couple of years now with 2 large dogs.  Both dogs quickly learned the boundaries with little training on my part.  Basically, it does exactly what it's supposed to.  It keeps my dogs within my property.

I had tried the underground wired fence but they learned to run through and it would be hard to get them back in.  Now, the collar continues to "correct" them if they run through.

Two complaints.  The older collars take a standard button cell battery.  Petsafe decided they could keep an income stream if they used their own proprietary battery on the new collars.  Also, your dog will probably become terrified of thunderstorms.  The collar will sometimes shock him for no reason during electrical storms so take off the collar when you hear thunder.

Overall, this is a great system.

I replaced a Linksys G router with this model. The first one I got from Amazon I spent hours trying to set-up properly before giving up and declaring it non-working. (I'm not an IT pro, but I'm reasonably competent at these things and set-up our existing wireless network, which has some complexities, and just could NOT get this to work reliably.) Once the replacement arrived I had it up and running in minutes, even with a manual set-up on my Mac. My signal strength is increased, somewhat (wi fi signal extends farther in the house), and the speed, especially close to the router, is much, MUCH faster than with G. (I'd say it's doubled.)

As long as you're somewhat versed in home networking, set-up should be easy (assuming you get a working unit) and this is a definite improvement over G. Well worth the upgrade in the end.

I personally believe that this book was the perfect ending. In fact, when I finished it that was the best word I could think of to describe it. It all boils down to the fact that this is a work of fiction - escapist fiction at that. Stephenie chose the ending she felt was best for the characters she loved. I agreed because I also loved these characters and wanted only the best for them. It's a great book. Read it. Below I've answered some of the more outragous complaints with my thoughts and feelings. 

I should probably say that I have been married for three years to a man that I met when I was fifteen and who I married when I was nineteen and about to go into my last year of college (yes I did finish college). I don't see anything wrong with someone of Bella's age getting married. Yes my life is not the ideal that Edward and Bella's is, but my husband and I are learning and growing together. In fact, I think marriage is easier for us because we have gone through these early life changing events together and have therefore changed together. Sure, it's not a bed of roses but I wouldn't change it for the world. I think it's sad that women who want a family first and foremost are made to feel wrong. To each their own. The only thing I've ever really wanted is to raise my own family. I'm proud of that fact and can't wait until my husband and I have our first child. I don't look down on you for wanting to be the CEO of Wal-Mart, don't look down on me for being content teaching preschool and starting a family. 

As for the teenage pregnancy, she was married for pete's sake. She's not Jamie Lynn Spears - getting married after having a baby at 16. She was in love with Edward, eternally committed in the eyes of God and the law, and got pregnant. Again, not ideal in your first year of marriage, but not the end of the world in her situation. I don't think Stephanie Meyer was advocating anything. She was simply following the story where it took her. Bella was not particularly religous, but she felt that she could not abort this baby. End of story. All of these people who are "pro-choice" only seem to agree when the choice is to abort. How about allowing everyone to do what's right for themselves? I support a woman's right to choose, but I know that if I were in that situation I would have the baby because that's what's right for me. 

Also, Stephenie explained why it was possible for Bella to concieve. Vampire WOMEN cannot concieve because their bodies do not change. Vampire MEN are changed at a point where they are still producing the vital baby making supplies. Therefore, a vampire man is able to impregnate a human woman. If that doesn't fly with you write your own vampire novel. It's her book and she can do what she wants. 

Bella's power. Again, perfect if you look at her character throughout the series. The thing she wanted most of all was to protect her family and friends. She is now able to do that. She went from being a total liability to being their strongest asset. She is able to shield them from anything. Also, any "personality changes" her becoming a vampire brought about were expected. I can't believe that any fans of the series would have wanted her to stay the same as her human self after being changed. It would have made absolutely no sense.

I saw this blanket when I was pregnant with my second child.  At first I was reluctant to buy it. I thought it was just another "money-making" item that wasn't necessary. It's not!!  It really works!  I got this blanket when my daughter was about 3.5 weeks old.  She had been having trouble getting back to sleep during night feedings and we were all miserable with no sleep!  She loves to be swaddled in this blanket and now falls asleep easily after feedings and we are all much happier!  

I also love the fact that it can be used in her infant car seat as well!  She's still too small for all the buntings we have for her.  The swaddle blanket keeps her nice and snug in her car seat!  I don't worry about her being cold in the seat or at night when she's SLEEPING!

I have had several USB hubs and know that you definitely need a powered one. This time I needed a more "powerful" one. By that I mean that I kept getting warnings when I plugged some peripherals in that they were not getting enough power to run properly. I chose the D-Link 7-port hub and find it to be perfect for my needs. I have six of the seven ports in use and have plenty of power available. I highly recommend this hub.

I know that many movie critics bombed this movie, but you really need to decide for yourself. 

I thought this movie was very well made, the acting was excellent, and the story was very intriguing. I have read the book the movie is based from, and the movie follows the book very closely. 

I have to say my favorite part of the movie is the music - the soundtrack is amazing! It was made by the same composer that did the soundtrack for Titanic and Braveheart, to name a few. 

Be prepared for a shocking ending - some don't like it, but I did. I think it's a realistic approach to the Holocaust - not every story has a happy ending.

Just chopped 2 onions in less than 1 min, no tears or smell.  Also chopped pecans and graham crackers with no effort.  Clean up is simple.  I also didn't notice any odor remaining in the plastic cup after chopping the onions !  I couldn't be more pleased !!!  I used my Pampered Chef hand chopper for 5 years until it started falling apart.  Found this little beauty on line and will NEVER go back.

Just purchased 2 more, 1 for back up and 1 for my daughter. If you do alot of cooking or prep you owe it to yourself to get this!  Thanks Black and Decker and Amazon !

No kings in this country though John Adams seriously wanted something not far from one at one point in the process of naming our Commanders in Chief, Presidents.  These works will make anyone watching them appreciate the sacrifices made by not only the Founding Fathers, but the Founding Mothers and Founding Siblings.  These folks are portrayed in naked reality, the good, the bad and the ugly.  Be prepared to watch this riveting series front to back.  

David McCullough has created a wonderful biography of #2 and hats off to him for it.  What an amazing guy to have done all the research he did and how dynamically and beautifully done the cinematography was, too.  The collaboration between him and HBO's people made for one awe inspiring depiction of what were truly tumultuous times.  

The acting is excellent.  Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney are such incredibly convincing actors.  They are simply the tops!  One could do far worse than to see this movie.  The sound track is worth buying, too.  The orchestrations are first rate and play to the period.  John Adams Composers Rob Lane and Joseph Vitarelli really evoke the emotions of the era and the people in their works.  

The stories about the writing of the book and the making of the movie are well worth watching.  It will make the tyros among us appreciate all the more the great efforts made by the folks who work on these productions.  

This material is great enough to make non-historians wannabe historians!  Highly recommended!  If ever you thought American history was boring, this movie will change your mind.  Compliments to Tom Hanks for making a great investment in making Hollywood the most it can be!

What can I add that 183 other people haven't already mentioned? I don't know how I've lived without this. I've already purchased 3 more for family members. I like that the lid can be snapped onto the end of the flash drive; it helps it from becoming lost. Dig into the paper inside the package to find the teeny little string you can loop through the lid. The two people I gave these to didn't go into the packaging and would have thrown away the strings if I hadn't retrieved them. I've heard people complain that Kingston Flash Drives are slow, but they've worked great for me.

I bought the Flip for my boyfriend for Christmas after seeing an ad for it on amazon.com. He had never owned a video camera before and barely uses his digital camera, so I wasn't sure if he was going to like it.  But, he ended up loving it.  He uses it all the time.  It is so easy to upload the videos, too.  All you do is plug the pop-out USB into your computer.  After the holidays, we were able to share our videos with both of our families by just uploading them on to everyone's computers. The quality of the video is pretty good too.

When we got the Flip, there was a black blotch on the screen.  It didn't hurt the video recording quality, but was annoying because you couldn't view the videos on the screen completely.  Amazon was very timely about sending a replacement.  They did not give me any hassles and it didn't cost me anything for the replacement. I would buy all of my electronics here!

Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Protein is without a doubt, the BEST protein supplement on the market! I have tried both the vanilla and chocolate flavors, each being superbly delicious in their own fashions. The vanilla is rather smooth and creamy when mixed with milk and also does very well when mixed with smoothies. However, the chocolate is my favorite of the two. It is surprisingly rich and flavorful that makes you craving for more!Overall, you cannot go wrong with this product. With 23 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs per serving, this is the ultimate protein supplement drink on the market today.

This is book 3 in the Twilight series, and I definitely feel in the minority.  One reviewer commented that if Twilight is about "finding love", New Moon is about "loosing love", and Eclipse is about "choosing love".  I think this was a brilliant summery of this series so far.  What am I to do when this whole series is based on the "destined love" between Bella and Edward, and I wish something would happen to Edward so that Bella and Jacob could be together!

Jacob, to me, is the best part of this series.  He is "fire" to Edward's "ice" literally and figuratively, and I am so much more inclined towards "fire".  Not only Jacob's body temperature, but his heart beats with warmth and love for Bella.  I loved their friendship in New Moon and now I have come to love their romantic love in Eclipse.

Obviously, this is not going to happen!  Edward and Bella are destined and it's like Jacob said best......

         "He's (Edward) is like a drug for you, Bella.  I see that you can't live without him now.  It's too late.  But I would have been healthier for you.  Not a drug; I would have been the air, the sun."

The Flip Video Mini is on its was to making traditional video cameras obsolete. The Flip Mini gives you...

- Good video quality (certainly not HD... but not bad)
- A rechargeable battery
- Ease of use ... if you have a PC (more on this later) it really is as easy as plugging the camera into your USB port
- Very small ... it is thinner than a deck of cards.... really it is about the size of an average cell phone (Non-Blackberry).
- 1 hour of video capturing ability. 
-Sleek enough looks that you would think that it was made by Apple.
- And in my opinion a pretty decent value

  Now when compared to the Flip Ultra it loses some of its charm... in fact, I would only recommend the Mini if you value the smaller size (It is about 1/2 the thickness) or if you have a passion for rechargeable batteries.

  --- one alert----

 Flip cameras are not as easy to use when you use Macs - and you do lose some of the built in editing and you-tube type features. In fact, if you are interested in Flip Camera and own a Mac I would highly recommend you buying Roxio Crunch Roxio Crunch Win/Mac as a means to convert your videos so that they can be viewed on your Mac. It is not hard to convert using Roxio Crunch, but it is an extra step.

Final tally - 5 stars for a PC user - 4 stars for a Mac - happy recording!

I had purchased a PetSafe PDBDT-305 for my Golden Retriever mix. After about 8 months of use, it was nothing but a battery eater! We researched the internet for a better unit. We purchased this one and couldn't be happier with it! The tone is loud enough that we can hear it, so we don't have to guess if it actually beeped. We have it set on "1" and it seems to be enough to get her attention. Others have mentioned how large it is, but it really isn't too bad. The collar has more than enough length to fit any size neck. We will have to trim off quite a lot. The remote is great! It is more ergonomic, the dial doesn't move so easy that you accidently set it on another number, like our previous Pet Safe Trainer. The buttons are easier to press and conveniently located. The neck strap is nice, too! It is nice to have a rechargeable unit! It will save us money in the long run. So far it has worked completely as stated. The range in much better than our previous unit, too! After searching for pricing, Amazon had the best price. We received it faster than expected. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!  Petsafe PDT00-10603 400 Yard and Park Remote Trainer

Great unit for the price. High quality display, runs well, love the battery life...

But last night it went into hibernation during a Windows update and completely scrogged its self - so much that it wouldn't boot at all. I became entirely unimpressed with MSI when their "F3 restore" to factory fresh OS didn't work AT all... In fact, it didn't seen to do anything.

We finally got it to boot into safe mode and used Microsoft's System Restore to get back up and running, but it was a hassle. Even now, when the OS begins to degrade in time (as Windows inevitably does), I'm concerned about how I'm going to wipe and restore the unit.

Overall, I like it... But sometimes I do wish I'd gone with a major brand with full support for US customers.

We have 3 cats in a small apartment; we will buy just about anything that reduces the amount of cat hair that accumulates. 

This brush definitely helps with keeping our home cleaner. It also keeps the cats coats looking shiny and beautiful. 

I use this brush in conjunction with a standard cat brush for optimal results. 

This brush takes a few times to get the hang of the angle which will remove the most excess hair, and each cat is a little different.

I loved Fireproof.  It's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and although it's nearly two hours long, I could watch it over and over again.  I think that Sherwood Pictures is honing its talent, and is beginning to make films that not only carry good messages, but also stand up technically.  I thought the cinematography was flawless, the soundtrack was great - during the action scenes and the more heartfelt ones - and everything was well put together.  Some of the acting could have been better, but overall everyone did an okay job.  Kirk Cameron, as the established actor in the cast, was perfect as Caleb Holt.  He was very convincing, and it was surprising to see him play an average everyday Joe as well as he did.  The comedic relief was well placed, and didn't take away from the emotional tone of the story.  And the gospel message wasn't cheesy and didn't seem forced - which is a rarity in Christian films.  I was surprised that Fireproof made close to $3,000,000 when I first heard the box office reports, but after watching the DVD, I'd say it was definitely earned.

Let me start by saying that I am a 38 year old wife & mother of 2 - therefore not your typical star-struck teenager and I am stunned by all the negative reviews for this book!  I found it just as engrossing as all its predecessors and was in no way "disappointed" or "disgusted" by Bella getting pregnant and having a child or by Jacob imprinting on Renesmee (the only thing I DIDN'T like was the poor child's name!!  LOL)  In fact I thought it very poignant that that happened to Jacob and was glad that his broken heart was finally healed.

Obviously this story was not supposed to be realistic (it revolves around vampires for crying out loud) and I don't think that your average teenage girl is going to say "I think I'll drop out of school and get married and have a baby, oh and then become a vampire."  I think the fans of this series have more sense then that.  It was just a good, old-fashioned page turner and I for one am thrilled by everything that happened and only wish it wasn't the end of the saga.  I esp. loved Bella's "gift" of shielding which explained a lot of events from the previous books.  

All in all, another outstanding book from Stephanie Meyer - my 2nd favorite after "The Host".

This is replacing a wrist-type blood pressure monitor. It matches the results of a standard sphygmomanometer, which the wrist monitor could never do. The 3-reading averaging (over 2 minutes) is just great. The software is okay, data-collection-wise, but could use some function changes. The monitor connected easily to my computer, and the management software found it and accessed it without any problems.

I thought the women at work were insane and I am not a reader.  I left for vacation and decided just to buy the first book thinking that I would be returning it to the bookstore and would never finish reading it.  I was so wrong.  I got lost in this series and read all 4 books and the draft for the next book "Midnight Sun" in less than 3 days.  I have now promoted this obsession to all my friends and the remainder of my co-workers. The movie brought the entire story to life.  I will probably not read another series like this again but will continue to read this one over and over again each time I decide to get lost in a book that can take me back to those awkward High School days and want to experience that first love feeling again.

I have used the Vado for several weeks now, including taking it on vacation over the holidays.  It works like a charm.  The resolution is NOT HD, but is quite sufficient for most perposes.  With the ability to store an hour or more of video, review it on camera and try again if necessary, its just what I wanted.  Only issue is the the USB connection is short, so I use a 3 inch USB extension so the camera is still lying flat what I unload the videos to my PC and recharge the battery.

Product lives up to the other reviews...  It heats up, primes, and makes (8) Shots of Espresso in 15-minutes, and that includes the clean up.  I went out and bought a lb. of Starbucks and was surprised that I was able to make genuine Starbucks Coffee Shop Quality Espresso, at home.  To get comparable taste, I set the grinder at #2 and lightly pressed the coffee in the two shot filter with the built-in tamper.  Unfortunately, the coffee beans started to deteriorate after 3-Days, as did the flavor of the coffee.  For the next bag of coffee, I'm supposed to purchase an airtight ceramic coffee canister and maintain the beans at room temperature (Per Google hits).

So far, so good.  I bought this as a market standard router for our apartment after Time Warner failed to bring a router as requested.  I considered the rangemax and ultrarange as options, but decided that our 1200 sq foot apartment was probably fine with this one.  We all have relatively new computers, two of which run on Vista, so the 802.11g was compatible with all of them.  I chose Linksys based on customer reviews and overall ratings.  Netgear seemed to have the lowest rating overall but D-Link seems on par so it may work just as well.

I did a bunch of research beforehand which helped a bit (I had no idea as to 802.11b versus g, etc.), and also found instructions on installing a wireless network from [...] which were actually great to have on hand since the Linksys user guide is on a CD.  Overall, setting it up was pretty easy, the only issue was that my roommate had disabled her wireless!  Once we figured that out, everything was connected.  I had to power down the modem and the router and restart the computers once they were connected to make sure everything worked but now everything is set.  I'm 30 feet and 4 walls away from the router and my internet is faster than it ever was with Time Warner.  It was worth the time and less money.

We purchased this Presto popper after getting fed up with the crummy air popper we had gotten from Target.  This popper is many times better than that product, and it pops almost all of the kernels into really great popcorn.  To get salt to stick, we spray with a bit of cooking spray, which works really well.  Only thing Presto could have done to make this even better would have been to add an On/Off switch.  But it's very minor.

I have two indoor cats and two lab retrievers. I bought this to use on all my pets, and it works amazingly (although you really need the larger size to be efficient on bigger dogs). You definitely need to be in a confined area where you can manage the huge amounts of fur, because there is a TON, every time you use it. I wouldn't use it more than twice weekly, because it does seem to get right down to their skin, and if you push too hard or run the brush over the same area too many times it could irritate them. Great product, well worth the money.

This is by far the best thing in my kitchen, and that includes my cooking.

With all of the attachments available for this mixer, I was able to get virtually ALL of my prep needs into one dedicated space.  This, in turn, has opened up the oh-so important counterspace in my kitchen.

The mixing capabilities of this thing are impressive to say the least.  I bake a lot of bread, and this mixer is able to handle my toughest doughs.  I have read some reviews of people's machine conking out on them when they try dough.  I wonder if they tried reading the manual, which explicitly states to never go above speed 2 on it.

I love the fact that this mixer is adjustable.  Mine came set to the precise height, but in time, that will change.  I love that I will be able to fix that on my own.

Since getting this, my breads have become more than just a home-made novelty, and have taken over all of the bread consumed in my home.  The cakes I've made with this mixer all come out as if professionally done, textures so light and fluffy that I forget I didn't buy them.

I've only had this product for a month, but so far, I like it.  My cats were very bad about drinking from the toilet and faucets instead of out of a bowl of water set out for them, and this was a great solution.  They both drink from this.

The only complaint I have is how noisy it gets- on the plus side, it lets me know when the water is getting low, but if it runs low in the middle of the night, it's loud enough to wake me.

Have used this kettle daily for two weeks.  I think it's great.  It is meant to boil water easily, and it does this perfectly:  simple to fill, quick to boil, easy to pour, easy to clean, shuts off automatically.  It is a sturdy piece of equipment and has a great look and feel.  I compared it to all similar items at amazon, and I'm glad that I bought this one.

It can be filled with one hand; the lid opens automatically.  The spout is big, but not so big that too much heat gets lost during boil.  It is easy to tell when the unit is on - the whole water gauge lights up brightly.  There is hardly any plastic that comes into contact with boiling water, none at all if you fill to less than full capacity.

Here are the minor drawbacks (I don't consider any of these truly significant).  The "ding" that signals a completed cycle is nice but almost inaudible.  I don't find that this matters though, because you can easily tell if the unit is on or off just by looking, and you know when a pot of water is about to boil when the loud rumbling goes away.  It shuts off automatically anyway, so a bell is not all that necessary.  The pot is not insulated, so yes, the metal does get very hot.  Only a problem if you have kids - no more dangerous than many other items in the kitchen.

As far as the bad smell/taste goes, I noticed it with the first 3 or 4 boils, then it went completely away.  Not a reason to avoid this item - just dump your first few pots.  Sometimes I wonder if other reviewers have used their purchases more than once before reviewing.

Forget the oldtime ice cream makers with the rock salt and the bags of ice.  All you have to do is keep the bowl in the freezer, and you're always ready to go.  This has worked like a charm every time I used it.  Yes, the ice cream is a little soft, but that's the way homemade ice cream should be.  Store bought brands have gum in them to make them thicker.  It is extremely simple to operate, and easy to clean.  Only 3 parts to wash for the whole machine. It is a little loud, but that's the only negative that I've found.  Great ice cream in 30 minutes start to finish, you really can't beat the convenience.

The Flip Mino is a great small camcorder for the price, mainly because of the form factor. It's a lot thinner and smaller than the Flip Video Ultra Series Camcorder, 60-Minutes  (White), yet yields equal performance. The only negative is that it doesn't take AA batteries like the Flip Ultra because it's so thin. Instead, it has a non user replaceable built-in lithium ion battery like an iPod. 

The Flip Mino does not neccessarily replace the Flip Ultra and the Flip Ultra is being sold side by side with the Flip Mino. And, the Flip Mino doesn't come in as many colors, only a black version and a white version.

I would say If you already have a Flip Ultra, you may not want or need to buy the Flip Mino (unless you really want the smaller form factor or you have money to burn) since it yields about the same video and audio quality. If you don't own a Flip video camera yet, the Flip Mino is probably the one to get unless you require AA batteries which admittedly is nice because they are readily available everywhere. I actually prefer AA batteries over an internal rechargeable battery that over a few years will start to lose it's charge and not last as long between charges.

That said, the Flip Mino is pretty nice because it's so small and thin.

Even though I have a digital point and shoot still camera that can shoot video, I find it easier to shoot video with the Flip Mino. The vertical form factor is better suited to shooting video. The built in software is nice and it's built into the camera so you need not install anything on your computer.

The Flip Mino is a great 'take everywhere' video camera that fits in your pocket and can yield some creative and endearing videos.

Its a nice machine, I probably didn't need one quite so powerful, I wanted to make sure it would make bread Ok. It does that! The only thing I don't like about it is that I can't lift the head back to put in ingredients. It has a pourer shield that is supposed to take the place of the movable head but doesn't always work as well. Over all, I like it alot. Rose

Anyway, AMAZON has a super deal right now and the price is amazing so I bought 2 of these to give to my sons for them and their wives. GREAT GREAT BRUSH!!!!!!

This product is not for the faint of gums, and should be used only as directed. Achieves maximum results in a ridiculously short amount of time. Has 3 different modes: clean, sensitive, and massage (which greatly assists when cleaning/flushing gums). This massage program is perfect to gradually reduce the symptoms of gingivitis over time. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep oral hygiene tip-top on a regular basis, or someone who is experiencing oral problems (such as recurrent bad breath, or food stuck between teeth). It also comes with two brush-heads a standard for everyday cleaning, and a compact head to use in order to help clear food from the rear of the oral cavity and greatly assist in localized stain removal. This version of the toothbrush comes with a UV Sanitizer to give you that fresh-and-clean feeling everytime you brush, literally! Hope you fall in love with this toothbrush as much as I did. :) Cheers!

I'm a stinkler when it comes to finding the best diaper for the best price.  Amazon takes the prize!  I have found nothing else that compares...the closest thing would be the Costco brand diapers, but even their deal isn't quite as good as this one. (Their diapers are Huggies Supremes with the Costco name on it, for those interested).  Here is why I like not only this deal, but this diaper:

1.  Stretchy tabs
2.  Scented (not everyone likes this, but I'd rather smell the scent than the pee like you do with Huggies.)
3.  Good quality diaper.  These diapers are made by the same company as Pampers and are the SAME diaper, just made with slightly cheaper materials.  Still feels pretty dang soft to me!
4.  They have fit all 3 of my kids great!  My kids tend to be pretty meaty, so these fit quite nicely on them.

I am a 21 year old male, and this is the first time I have tried this product. I decided to get in shape as of Jan 1, and I purchased Hydroxycut hardcore because of my football player/weightlifter roommate's recommendation. 

I didn't have a chance to workout the first day I took it, so the only difference I noticed was maybe a little extra energy. I am not a morning person, so it was a nice pick up that got me through until my body caught up. I used to drink soda like crazy, so I didn't notice the huge caffeine rush like some others have. On the second day, I took it 15 minutes before my workout, and I noticed a huge difference. During my run, I felt it kick in and gave me the feeling that I could run for a lot longer. I usually start to fatigue around 2 miles, and after the first mile and a half, it felt like I had just started running! Then, during my medicine ball situps, I felt like I could go forever. I did twice as many as normal, and only stopped because I did not want to hurt myself. This stuff helped so much! 

I have yet to experience any negative side-effects, and I would say that others have because everyone's body is different. If you are used to drinking a regular coffee every morning or a good amount of soda, you will be fine with this, as long as you substitute this for your daily caffeine intake, and drink the recommended daily amount 

I am just looking to get rid of my small gut, and I have asked about 10 different people for their opinion on this, and read literally hundreds of reviews on multiple products in this category. Even though Muscletech generally "hypes up" their products like crazy, this is one that lives up to the hype. I will definitely recommend this to anyone who is on a low-calorie, high protein  diet, and is consistently in the gym. It will definitely help you to attain your goals.

I grew up in a Crepe lovin' household. We had sweet crepes for breakfast, savory crepes for lunch and meat filled crepes for dinner.I always have used a stove top crepe pan and thought it slow and kind of a pain. That is how my dad always did it so I always thought it was the best way.Not anymore. A friend recommended I try the Villaware electric crepe maker. Non stick coating, quick and easy. Boy were they right. Just dip the the cooker in the pan they include and you are making a crepe every 25 seconds or so. Easy to clean. I love this thing. Good recipes too, altough their basic recipe is not sweet enough.If you love crepes. This is the piece to get.

Sitting through a movie about sibling rivalry at a wedding, especially one starring the doe-eyed and normally facile Anne Hathaway, sounds like a potentially painful way to spend an evening. However, as directed by Jonathan Demme and written by Jenny Lumet (daughter of master filmmaker Sidney Lumet), this 2008 drama is not a lightweight star vehicle ?la Julia Roberts circa 1997 but a darkly realistic look at the dysfunction within a family thrown into disarray. Using an almost cin閙a v閞it?style, Demme explores how a wedding reopens old wounds within a family in a naturalistic way made all the more palpable by the emotional acuity in Lumet's screenplay.

The focus is on Kym, a chain-smoking former model who has spent the last several months in rehab. As a substance abuser whose only armor is cutting sarcasm, she is absurdly hopeful that her sister Rachel's wedding will be a harbinger for unconditional love from her upscale Connecticut family. Therein lies the problem as her narcissism provides the catalyst for long-simmering tensions that uncork during the preparations for a lavish, Indian-themed wedding weekend (the movie's working title was "Dancing with Shiva"). It soon becomes clear that Kym's link to a past tragedy is at the core of the unpredictable dynamics that force confrontations and regrettable actions among the four principal family members. Rachel appears to be Kym's sensible opposite, but their alternately close and contentious relationship shows how they have not full recovered from past resentments. Their remarried father Paul is a bundle of loving support to the point of unctuous for both his girls, while their absentee mother Abby is the exact opposite - guarded and emotionally isolated until she is forced to face both her accountability and anger in one shocking moment. 

Anne Hathaway is nothing short of a revelation as Kym. Instead of playing the role against the grain of her screen persona, she really shows what would happen if one of her previous characters - say, Andy Sachs in The Devil Wears Prada - went another route entirely. The actress' studiousness and persistence are still very much in evidence, but the story allows her to use these traits under the guise of a self-destructive, often unlikable addict who gains attention through her outrageous self-absorption. As the put-upon title character, Rosemarie DeWitt realistically shows Rachel's sense of pain and resentment as the attention veers to Kym during plans for the most important day of her life. Bill Irwin is winning as the unapologetically grateful Paul, but it's really Debra Winger who steals her all-too-brief scenes by bringing the remote character of Abby to life. Now in her early fifties, the famously tempestuous actress seems to rein in her innate fieriness to play a woman who consciously disconnects herself from the family she raised. What remains is a crumbling fa鏰de of propriety masking this obvious gap. It's similar to Mary Tyler Moore's turn as the cold mother in Ordinary People, but casting the normally vibrant Winger (who probably would have played Kym a quarter century ago) is a masterstroke.

The film is not perfect. Demme's home-video approach, while novel at first, proves wearing over the 114-minute running time. Pacing is also a problem, especially when the focus turns to the minutiae of the wedding ceremony and reception. I wish Demme could have cut this part of the film, so we could get to the icy, unfinished resolution sooner. As a filmmaker who obviously enjoys making music concert films (Stop Making Sense, Neil Young - Heart of Gold), there are quite a few musical performances presented in total. However, for non-aficionados, it may prove too much over time. While it's refreshing to see interracial marriages treated so casually (Lumet's grandmother is legend Lena Horne), Demme makes almost too big a point in presenting a global community though the diverse music and the wedding's multi-cultural themes. The movie starts to feel like a Putumayo collection of third-world performances. Still, Demme's intentions can't be faulted, and neither can the piercing work of Hathaway and Winger.

Now I slip this little camera into my pocket or purse and it is always on hand for some great shots.

I downloaded the trial version of Office Professional 2007 first, I mainly use MS Word, my old 2003 documents opened up great and I have more options now. I have saved as Office 2003 and opened at work with 2003 and everything is the same. 
With Excel there are a few things to get used to, but as with alot of major changes in new releases this was expected
I then downloaded the MS Office Ultimate 2007, and I like the features although I dont realy have a use for OneNote, and Groove.
Overall I feel this is a more user friendly user interface, I talked to some friends and they dont like the changes made, but they admit it is more "I am used to the old" "Why change?".
I use Open Office and MS office, each one has its own perks.
To me it is like getting used to a new car, the size, the functions, where the controls are. The more you use them the more at home you are with them.
Overall a very good product, although over priced. Open Office=free.

Next to the Bible, this is the most life changing book I've ever read. I find that the back cover of this book (the same description given above) is at best underwhelming and even deceptive. It's deceptive (not on purpose) because it doesn't give enough persuasive information to let you know how fantastic this book is. For the first time in my 19 years of professional life, the top of my desks in both of my offices are clear, there are no stacks of papers and folders on my shelves, things are in order, my mind is clear and I feel a level of optimism and enthusiasm for my (way too many) projects that I've not had in a long time. My colleagues are envious and amazed because I haven't garnered a reputation of being organized, but they see I am. 

Allen's approach is fairly low tech. While you can use a computer to help you get organized, you can use traditional pencil, paper, folders and file cabinets. He uses the raw materials everyone else uses. But a master artist and I could have the same materials in front of us and he or she will create a work of art while I will create slop. Ordinary office supplies in the hands of Allen's very logical (and easy to maintain) workflow are a work of art. I can't believe how simple this all is, but after 19 years of always trying to get organized, I certainly did not come up with these dynamite workflow habits, so Allen is to be commended.

This was the best money I've spent on a book.

I've had the Keurig B-40 Elite for about two months ago, and more than ever before, I am looking forward to getting up in the morning.

What initially attracted me to the Keurig line of single-serve coffeemakers was the option to use your own coffee in a reusable coffee filter (available separately from Amazon.com for $14.95) instead of the K-Cups, which can cost over 50 cents each. Leery of signing onto a razor-razor blade model, I wanted the flexibility to be frugal.

I ruled out the higher-priced B-50 and B-60 because I didn't need all the bells and whistles that those models offer. I don't need a timer (really, if you can brew a cup of coffee on demand, why would you want a machine that makes it at a set time?) or a blue LED display (although it is pretty). I might have liked the variable brew size option (two sizes on the B50 and three on the B-60), but to save $50 and $100 respectively I could live without it.

Setup on the B-40 Elite is straightforward. Follow the instructions for priming the unit (a one-time affair), and you're good to go. I confess that I brewed my first cup with one of the 18 K-Cups that came included with my unit. They are fiendishly convenient. The B-40 Elite delivers 7.25 ounces of coffee per brew, which turned out to be just the right amount for me. Before this, I was using a French press, so the coffee that comes out of the Keurig does not measure up in strength, but it is still flavorful and oh-so-fresh, and of course with a French press only your first cup is hot. I was astonished at how quickly the Keurig produces a cup of coffee-pop in the K-Cup, or spoon your coffee into the filter basket, (firmly) lower the handle, press "Brew," and in less than 30 seconds you're drinking a very good cup of coffee.

Even in its stripped-down incarnation, the Keurig B-40 Elite still has some nifty features. In addition to Auto Off, which is handy if you're only going to brew one or two cups in the morning, the unit has lights that come on when it's time to add water to the 48-ounce reservoir and when it's time to descale the machine. (As I've only had the unit for a short while I haven't had to descale yet.)

One cautionary note: When filled with water, the reservoir is somewhat awkward to replace-instructions recommend filling it to the line, but putting in less water than that makes it easier to handle. 

All factors considered, the Keurig B-40 Elite is a handsome and functional single-serve coffeemaker, and I recommend it to anyone who loves their coffee fresh and hot.

I had read the reviews but remained somewhat skeptical yet reasonably assured enough to buy this product. It sharpens all of my knives very well. My old high carbon steel chef knife that mom brutalized by sharpening on the sidewalk was restored to original sharpness in one instructions cycle. Just follow the instructions to the letter, that is quite important. Using force on this machine in hopes of getting the job done faster than what the instructions say will just stall the motor, but it will spin again once the excessive force is released. It gets tricky sharpening long knives like my 2 feet long BBQ-stabber, as I like to call it, since the tip requires some tilting and a steady pace is needed for even sharpness. I did not experience any sparks from sharpening my Dexter Russel high carbon knife. I usually see sparks with the higher velocity motored sharpeners like the one I use at work; put enough pressure on those babies and there'll be fireworks alright. Not exactly a good idea though ;)

We were recently given a feral kitten. Afraid of people, we didn't want to stress it any further by taking it to the vet. Back in the day, I would call my vet and he'd have whatever medicine needed ready for me at the counter. I no longer have a relationship with a vet, but called around trying to find someone sympathetic to my plight. No one would write a prescription unless they had seen the kitten. I called around to stores, but the brands I found were reviewed poorly online. I read positive statements regarding the application of Zymox Otic online and set out to find it locally. The only place I found it was with a "holistic" veterinarian, and they refused to sell it to me! I ended up purchasing it online and the relief was almost immediate. We applied it as recommended and the mites are gone for good. I see no difference in the efficacy of this medicine compared to any other prescription drug available from the vet. Don't hesitate because it isn't coming from your vet, this is medicine which WORKS!!

I am soo disappointed. On Twilights page i stuck up for it all the way. but now? i feel like the series everyone loved had turned south. i admit im still hooked but i hope it shapes up. 

First of all i want to say, i love jacob, but he needs to go NOW. im tired of this whole "jacob or edward" crap. We love twilight because of EDWARDS and bellas relationship, not jacobs. i really do like jacob, i do, but still. He might have been amazing for bella, but if your going to do that, MAKE ANOTHER SERIES. this series is about bella edward and that other wonderful vampires. Im just mad that meyers totally changed up the plot to make jacob involved. its like The O.C. they tried to make up for the shows by making a huge change and kill marissa, but it didnt work, and this isnt either. it seems meyers is getting worse. its like when she wrote twilight it was for her, and now its not.

out of all the three books, this is my least favorite. i regret buying it. the whole day after i felt grumpy. Why would bella do that to edward. i dont care what people say. Edward is the best and is wayy more mature than jacob.

Truly one of the best movies I have ever seen! It was breathtakingly beautiful. Not only the looks (which were by far the best Pixar has dished out) but also emotionally. I'll start with the star: WALL*E. He was THE most adorable thing I have seen. From the way he moved to the way he "talked". He oozed cuteness. WAAAALLEE! And then there was the relationship between WALL*E and EVE. I have seldom seen a more true relationship, even in humans. I think I speak for most when I say that I was a little teary at some parts, whether it be story related or from it's visual beauty. However, the movie is not just sun shine and rainbows. It has a very strong message, present throughout most of the movie that really unnerved me. This future is very possible. However, only Pixar could suceed in not turning it into the preachy film it so easily could have been. The perfect movie! Way to go Pixar! 10 out of 10

I just got the Pink Flip video camcorder today and I have to say it is so easy to use. The features on it are basic which is perfect if you just want a simple camcorder. It's pretty much all in one no USB cables to use and it has the software pre-installed into the device so all you have to do is hook it up and the it installs automatically. Updated software is available which is a plus. I love to vlog on Youtube and this is perfect! It's so small you can carry it anywhere. I think what would make this product better is having a lithium ion battery vs AA batteries but otherwise it's great!

This is the little camera that could. you can download easily to YouTube and be famous! Or you can blackmail your family and make them famous. 

But my favorite feature is the ability to remove still shots from any video. It is a huge advantage to be able to pick your expressions, their mouth open or shut, ditto their eyes. If you try this on your Flip, you will probably ditch your little still camera and quit using your phone for movies or stills, since you pick them later directly from the computer screen, thus allowing a BIG picture instead of the usual postage stamp image from your camera or phone.

It is the best of both worlds, a great easy to use-and I do mean easy to use-video camera with the super little farkle of being able to make really great stills from the footage.


I did cover the lens and back screen with protective film on the one I gave my grand-daughter, as the ladies often tend to just drop it in the purse with keys, razor blades, machetes, lawn mower blades, and the inevitable sling-blade weed scythe lurking in there.

When I initially ordered this item for my girl friend, "Gossip Girl Season 1", I asked the seller if he could have the set to me before Christmas? At this time it was about 3 or 4 days from Christmas and I was already thinking that I'm going to have to tell my girl friend that one of her gifts may be a bit late. To my surprise, the set arrived 1 or 2 days from Christmas, which was one of the best and nicest things you could do for another human being! This seller saw to it that my gift for my girl friend, which by the way was all explained to the seller as well, as far as this being a Christmas gift for my girl friend. It, as I said, arrived a day or 2 early and because of this person, the seller, I had that much of nicer Christmas all due to this person caring enough to get my purchase to me as fast as possible. For that, I could not give this seller as much credit as he or she deserves! Thank you!!

I tried the wrist unit that I borrowed from a relative and the readings seemed to be too low.  The arm unit is much more accurate, closer to the doctor's office than the wrist device.  The memory comes in handy for tracking changes and it gives an average.  It is physically a lot bigger than I expected, though.

for a while i had been considering switching to an electric razor...but i was a little stand-offish after hearing that you can't get as close as a blade...i didn't want a sandpaper face after spending a good bit of money on a razor...so i borrowed a rotary razor from my grandfather and decided the shave wasn't as bad as i expected...so after doing a good bit of research...i decided on the braun 9595...holy cow did this ever do the trick...from the get go i had a shave that was just as close as a blade...no irritation, smooth skin, quick shave, easy operation, and it cleans and recharges itself in the dock...the cleaning system is very nice...not only does it leave the razor smelly nice and citrusy...but the dock also lets you know the level of the cleaning solution...also...i thought a 1 hr charge only yeilding 50 minutes of shaving was odd...but as it turns out...i have to clean it 2 or 3 times before the charge gets halfway down...

the only reason this didn't get 5 stars is b/c i have to work a little hard sometimes to get all the hairs on my neck...but its usually not a big deal

i would reccomend this razor to anyone and everyone...i might go as far to say that this is the best money can buy

This review is from: Doubt [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)

      



One may be initially drawn to Doubt because of the star power of Meryl Streep, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, or even Amy Adams. About ten minutes into this phenom of a movie, you become drawn into this tale and await the thespian standoff you just know is coming. And what a treat it is!

Sometimes, plays that become movies, despite the authors attempt to "open it up", just end up looking like a filmed play, static and overly talkative. John Patrick Stanley, who authored the play, clearly knows his stuff. The screenplay sparkles with the spoken gems of the stage production, yet moves through the screenplay with panache and vigor. He quietly allows us to get to know these formidable characters, their strengths and weaknesses (if any), and them lets them loose in the story to wreck havoc amongst each other. This is truly a character driven drama.

Sister Aloysius Beauvier (realized fully by Streep, and is this the same woman who gave us Donna in Mamma Mia! The Movie (Two Disc Special Edition)?) is a stern and discpline driven principal of St. Nicholas school in the Bronx, run by nuns trying to educate their students and care for their souls. Father Flynn (Hoffman) is a radical new priest which immediately runs into opposition by Beauvier, clinging to the old ways. But this is not merely a new versus old conflict. Stanley interjects another story, one more modern, concerning the revelations of the Catholic Church's decision to hide its abusive priests from the public. Flynn may or may not have done something improper in the rectory with a new black student. Kind Sister James alerts her boss to the suspicion, and, pardon the expression, all hell breaks loose in the school.

The brilliance of the script is Stanley never allowing any of his characters to fall into stereotypes. Beauvier cares for her students and fellow nuns, revealing a softer heart than you might think; Sister James is not merely a bubble headed optimist, but truly has depth to her compassion; Flynn has his motives, unspoken as they are. With each scene, who to side with is difficult to pick; do I want the principal to win to protect the kids or to stop the church's progress? Do I want the progressive priest to win, to encourage movement forward but at the risk of the children? Stanley plays with us constantly, and to watch that interplay is the movie's true joy. Add in a spectacular twist that I just didn't see coming, and an Oscar worthy performance of Viola Davis as the possibly afflicted student's mother, and you have a truly cinematic experience.

Doubt is one of those movies that comes out in December to hopefully gain some attention from the Oscars. In this case, it is well deserved. I highly recommend Doubt, very worthy of your time during this busy holiday season.

My dog does well on two a day. If he misses a dose, he's limping within hours. 

The downside: The tablets may be chewable, but he doesn't like the taste of them and swallows them whole. I wonder if that lesses the strength. 

The upside: However, it's easier for him to take these than the capsules. The capsules are sticky when wet and get stuck on his tongue.

I was skeptical reading all the promotional material for this new shaver.  I'm 54 years old and have been using a razor all my life.  About a year ago, the razor started irritating my skin so I was forced to begin using a Norelco rotary electric shaver that I kept under the counter.  The results were far from satisfactory but at least it didn't cause a rash on my face.  I figured that was just the nature of electric shavers and was convinced that I would be living with a scratchy, stubbly beard the rest of my life.  Then I read a review on this new Pulsonic shaver in the August 2007 issue of Popular Mechanics magazine.  It sparked my interest so I researched it more on the internet.  I finally decided to take a chance and purchase the highly acclaimed but expensive shaver.

I've been using it now for one month and am convinced that it is not possible for an electric shaver to work better than this one.  I't leaves the Norelco rotary in the dust.  I would say it shaves about 97% as close as a regular lather & razor shave.  It does not leave stubbles and it isn't necessary to shave more than once a day.  Yes, it takes a small investment to purchase this shaver but it is a quality item that you can live with for life.

The self-cleaning charger/holder requires replacement cleaning fluid cartriges periodically.  The information I read says that a cartrige is good for about a month.  However, the razor head can also be cleaned by rinsing it under hot water...which is what I do for two days and then run it through the complete cleaning cycle every third day.  After a month doing this the original cartrige still says "FULL".  I have purchased three more cartriges for $16.  I think those will last me for a very long time.

I have nothing bad to say about this shaver after having recovered from the shock of the initial purchase price.  You get what you pay for and you will certainly pay for this one.  I don't regret spending the money for this shaver at all.

Neat product! Appears to be well built, is very quiet, easy to refill, and looks nice.  Our cats like the fountain and the water sound.  I like the charcoal filter that helps keep the water fresh.

Pros:  Small and light for throwing in your bag with a sweet price tag.  Has enough processing power for web surfing, listening to music and composing papers.  Since it has an integrated video card gaming is not exceptional, but great at solitaire!  Great battery life with a good work load I get an average of 4-5hrs depending on what I am doing.

Cons: The Xandros OEM software does not allow for customization too much, so I changed it too Ubuntu.  Works awesome now! Takes some getting use to typing on the smaller keyboard, but you conform.  The right shift button takes the most work getting use to.

Great computer for students who are looking for a word processor, web surfer, and music box(get and external HD).  Gamers would be better looking else where.

This was exactly what I was looking for to try and get my cat out of the bathroom sink.  Unfortunately, my cat still likes the sink but he does enjoy the drinkwell bowl as well.  This was easy to setup and keep clean.  It is a little loud (sounds like it's raining outside on the quiet night) but some people may enjoy the sound.  I would not get the large water bottle attachment since you should clean the bowl often anyway.  Overall a good product for the price.

I am greatly enjoying my Zen still after a month. It's thinner and lighter (and cheaper) than the competition and the software and interface are all easy to use. It sounds great through my premium $350 and $150 earphones. The video screen is nice for a 2.5" and just barely big enough IMO to actually watch video.

All of these PMPs have oddities and this one does too:
- I have had to reset it twice now but lost no data.
- It occasionally loses connection with the PC and USB needs to be reconnected.
- It does not support AC3 sound. This is a bigger problem than you might think as most .mp4s from the iPod world have AC3 sound.
- As per the .mp4 problem expect to convert most video. All video must also be 320x240 or smaller.
- It only supports iTunes AAC, not Nero.
- The media transfer program will deny many Xvid and avi videos but they play fine if transferred manually.
- The button clicking noise is actually a little loud, use care in libraries!

I give it 4 stars due to these but I have no plans to get another and will keep using my Zen.

Galactica is without doubt one of the best TV shows ever produced. it is a deeply moving experience on so many levels - spirtual, emotional and so forth. it delves into the very nature of what it is to BE and the nature of existence itself. I always feel that Sci-fi is the wrong category to put Galactica in as it is not some silly tosh where peoeple run around in romper suits with plastic guns and (obviously) prosthetic 'aliens'. 
Never forger, of course the astounding music that goes with it! 
All you downloaders - DON'T - buy it instead (yeah, like that will have any effect)! support the shows you like or they will cease to be.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)

      



Two important features of Office for Mac 2008 that you'll probably never notice is that fact that it now runs natively on Intel Macs and that it's completely compatible with Office for Windows 2007. However I have to say that it took almost twice as long for the newer version of Word to open on my Intel iMac as did the 2004 version. Excel and Entourage opened at just about the same speed. I don't know about Outlook, because I don't use it.

The new Mac version interface is an awful lot like the ribbon interface on the Windows version and all those toolbars are now palettes which I like better. I don't know think this makes it any easier to use, but it's still very Mac like and now more closely resembles it's Windows cousin.

However, even though it's interface has been changed, Word for Mac 2008 isn't all that different from the 2004 version. At least not for most users, but if you are into creating fancy documents, then you're going to like this version, because it's got some nifty desktop publishing tools. If you want, you can be creating flyers and pages that look like they came from an expensive page layout program in no time at all.

And Excel for Mac 2008 has new tools for walking you through formulas and I just love Formula Builder. The Elements Gallery gives you lots of templates for common tasks, like figuring out your household budget for example.

All in all I'd have to say that this program is worth buying and if you already have the 2004 version I think the upgrade is worth it too.

It's everything you expect from a CH product. Its amazingly precise and built like a tank. The Fighterstick USB is one of those products that helps you achieve a higher level of play. Be warned though that this stick is definitely made for larger hands. My hand dimensions are as follows: 7 3/4" from end of middle finger to wrist. 3 1/2" wide across the palm. Thumb length is 2 3/4". I can reach everything without too much trouble, but the top (8-way) hat switch and the top button is a bit of a stretch. This joystick could have benefited from an adjustable hand-rest like those found on the Saitek sticks. I still give this product 5 stars because it works flawlessly, has never lost calibration, its durable, and its the most technically precise joystick I've ever used.

Before I purchased it, I read the reviews... and hesitated.  It seemed that several people were having problems with the product.  But the price was right ($20) so I went ahead... and I'm so glad that I did.  I'm guessing that those who had problems cleaning it didn't read the directions on how the strainer pops apart (which makes for really easy cleaning); and those who may have had trouble with the motor burning out, likely were pressing wayyyy too hard (which isn't necessary for it to juice quite effectively).  Treat it gently and respectfully (like any molded plastic product), and you will have a delicious return on your investment.

I am wandering far afield from my regular fare to review an over-the-counter medication, and I am certainly not a doctor or in any way qualified to advise anyone as far as medicines go, but I did feel compelled to review Prilosec because, to me, it is a wonder drug, and I am so very glad it is now available over the counter.  My stomach and I have something of a love-hate relationship, and I am prone to pressure of a certain sort in my upper abdominal regions from time to time.  It may or may not be heartburn; all I know is that it feels like industrial strength hunger pangs taking root way up high and that it can be triggered by the consumption of such foods as white chicken meat, turkey and dressing, and cantaloupe.  Whatever it is, it is darn uncomfortable and liable to last for a couple of days if left to its own acidic devices.  Antacids do nothing to help me, and even the purple pill known as Nexium strikes out every time.  My only hope in these situations is Prilosec, which until now has not always been available to me because it could only be obtained with a prescription.  Now, though, I can always have a ready supply of this wonder drug on hand, and while the pharmaceutical company isn't exactly giving this stuff away, the cost is definitely worth it in terms of peace of mind, not to mention peace of stomach.The package says that Prilosec is not intended for the immediate relief of heartburn, that it should be taken over a course of several days and may require at least a day to reach full effect.  I'm not going to argue the point.  In my case, though, Prilosec knocks out the worst of my discomfort within an hour; it really takes no time at all to work its magic inside my system.  Prilosec may not work as quickly or as effectively for others out there, but I would definitely recommend you give this product a try if you do suffer from heartburn and similar problems on a frequent basis, especially if nothing else you have taken in the past seemed to prove very effective.

My biggest fear was that this film would just totally destroy the original transformers storyline and be a big joke, but it wasn't. I can see why it took so many years after the original series to bring an actual film (live, non-animated) to the big screen, the special effects are just phenominal in this film and just weren't available back in 1985-88.  Second, despite it having some changes in the origin story of how and why the transformers came to earth, it a good one, and does nothing to tarnish the transformer's legends.  There is no ark, and they didn't crash land here on earth and lay dormint for 4 million years like the Cartoon (and original marvel comics), they came in search of a cube, not just any cube, the cube is the Allspark, lifegiver to all of the transformers (similar to the oricle/spark from the original cartoon and bestwars)  Yes, it is still a civil war of robots, and yes, the cartoon characters are the same ones in the movie.  So they made some changes in the type of cars/vehicles/items that the transformers were, notably bubblebee a camaro not a  Bug, And they used Sam Witwicky instead of spike witwicky (and dad was not notably named sparkplug), no big deal. Overall, they stayed true to the ideals and personalities of the original series, and even the voices and vehicle styles.  Finally, the casting of the actual people was done well, and the acting was actually decent for an action flick.  As a transformer's junkie, I must say I highly recommend seeing this film, and will definitely be on my shelf when available on DVD.  Do note, that unlike the cartoon, this does get fairly violent with people getting stabbed and flying all over the place, so not really great for little kids.

My cat was full of attitude...  He was so sweet, but he had one major FLAW, he would pee on our beds.  Nasty, I know.  Thank goodness we had mattress protectors so nothing soaked in, but I was doing laundry just about everyday.  I found this on the net, and it is the nest stuff ever.  He has stopped pottying anywhere but in his box.  I love this stuff and am a customer for life.  It is great.  It makes your cat happy and relaxed.

This toothbrush cleans my teeth about as well as my traditional toothbrush did, but makes the chore of brushing a little easier for someone who is kind of lazy about such matters.  Overall I'm happy with it, but there are some minor gripes, and one serious flaw you should be aware of.

First, as you can see, this is going to take up a lot more reality on your countertop than a regular toothbrush, and will take up one of your electrical outlets.

Second, brush head replacements are seriously overpriced (think razorblade cartridge replacements).

Last, and not at all least, unless you remove the brush head and store it separately in between brushes, slime and gunk WILL build up in the space between the unit and the brush head (it is not water-tight).  This slime and gunk WILL grow mold.  This mold WILL be in close proximity to your mouth, and make you thoroughly disgusted.  Also, once it's in there, it's impossible to clean out because the inside of the brush head is full of nooks and crannies you can't get to even with a q-tip; you'll have to throw out the brush head and buy an overpriced replacement.

So for someone like me who bought this because he is lazy, taking the brush apart and putting it back together (and taking up more space storing the brush head separately) is fairly unappealing.

It works well, but just be aware of that one major flaw before buying.

I work at home when I'm not traveling to customers' sites.  The B70 fills my coffee and tea needs all day.  I usually drink about 5 cups of coffee throughout the day.  I enjoy having it on-demand and being able to make it quickly.  I prefer the k-cups made by Timothy's, especially their Nicaraguan bold and Sumatran bold.  For teas, I enjoy the Timothy's Lemon Blueberry.
Many reviews focus on the poor coffee strength.  That is why I prefer those "bold" types by Timothy's and other coffee vendors.  They have more coffee and produce a stronger-tasting drink.

I bought a Farouk CHI 1 inch ceramic flat hairstyling iron a little over a year ago from Amazon.com. I use this iron almost every day and I absolutely love it! Farouk flat irons are a higher end model for hairstyling devices so they can be pretty expensive, sometimes running as high as $200! But, I found a more affordable one online at Amazon. When originally looking for a high quality flat iron, I soon learned that Farouk flat irons are one of the best brands in the market! Through my search, I learned quickly that Farouk's flat irons are used at most beauty salons and have earned them an impressive reputation. Through my use, I have noticed that they are extremely durable hairstyling devices. I have dropped my flat iron several times and it has always avoided damage. Also, I have accidently left my flat iron on for several hours without it becoming damaged or anything near it. But, it is not due to human error why Farouk's have a great reputation. Farouk have earned a high reputation because the irons have a ceramic coating which prevents extreme heat from damaging the hair, which is great since most women straighten their hair almost every day! Also, this iron takes only one time to flatten a section of hair. This is unlike most other hairstyling devices because usually it takes three to four times to straighten a section. This can be extremely damaging to the hair due to the repeated heat. When using the Farouk flat iron, I recommend using the Farouk Heat Protection Spray which coats the hair with a protective agent. I have a noticed a significant difference in the amount of damage since using the spray with this flat iron! My only complaint is with amazon.com, the flat iron was originally to be mailed within a few days but instead took several weeks.

Admittedly, I was hesitant about dropping almost $300 on a MIXER, but since my wife has been asking for one for quite awhile I took the plunge.  Not only did I get a good discounted price from Amazon, but when it arrived we were both very impressed at the quality and expandability this unit has.  It has quite a few peripherals for shredding, slicing, etc. as well as making your own pasta and even *shudder* "sausage"...  (eek...)  In any event, it all works great and it's an excellent unit for the price.

I've used one of those round metal hoop combs on our cat for the past two years and thought it was effective. Didn't think it was worth springing the extra money for the Furminator, but I was wrong. I am shocked by how much more hair comes out. Her coat is super soft after using it as well. She purrs the whole time and typically rubs her face against the Furminator as soon as I pull it out of the basket. Highly recommend it, even if you think your cat doesn't shed that much. The small one is perfect sized for a cat, but probably too small for medium or large dogs.

This is much lighter and feels cheaper than what I would have expected, but I purchased it based on someone else's online review who ran over it when it was stood up on edge. It didn't break, but instead gouged the asphalt. I don't plan on doing that, so I'll take that test at face value over my own assessment of weight and construction. If it is truly made of titanium, I know weight can be deceptive. Very pleased with product. Like not having a cap. It doesn't have much to work with if you want to use a lanyard, just a small ring attached to one corner. I use a fishing barrel swivel to attach it to my key ring.

I received this for Christmas and have loved using it daily. All you have to do is clip it on and walk. I monitor my daily progress and love the ease of this device. It shows calories burned, time of aerobic walk, miles and the 7 day memory is a bonus. This along with the Omron Heart Rate monitor and your set to burn that extra weight away. The accuracy of this is outstanding. I test mine all the time and it is right on target. Highly recommend this.....10 stars if I could.

My husband bought me this mixer mainly for the purpose of kneading dough.  I love this mixer as it has made it so easy for me to bake bread.  It does a better job of kneading than when I would knead the dough manually.  I love the fact that it's one machine that one will ever need and I am able to use many attachements for many different things.  It's my favorite thing in the kitchen!!

I admit...I jumped on board the Galactica bandwagon just before the 3rd season began, but boy am I ever glad I did. To say this is the best show on television is an understatement. This is by far the best show I've seen in many years, perhaps the best show I've seen since I first sat in front of a glowing tube. I had zero expactations coming in. I simply saw a promo for season 3 on SciFi one day and decided to give the first season a try. It wasn't long before seasons 2.0 and 2.5 were in my cart ready for checkout.

This second season starts where the first one left off with "Scattered"  all the way through to Pegasus (which is one of my favourite episodes of the series, even though it has a particularly uncomfortable scene involving Sharon).  Along the way is "Flight of the Phoenix" which is one of the few episodes that inspires hope and was just satisfying to watch (Especially for Roslin). I'm not a particular fan of splitting up the season like this, but it did work since I bought it anyway.

The acting is phenomenal, and I don't think Tricia Helfer gets the credit she deserves. She has to play multiple characters who all display different characteristics, and she makes you forget that it's one actress playing all of them.  That's not to say that Callis, Olmos, McDonnell, Sackhoff, Hogan and everyone else aren't great actors as well, because they're also fantastic. The writing is top-notch. The CGI is frakking awesome. And perhaps often overlooked, the cinematography is outstanding.

If you're looking for a show that deals with issues that range from  political and societal to philosophical and religious, then you've come to the right place. I've been trying my hardest to get friends and family to watch this show, but so far one one person has heard my plea.  People are turned off by both the name and the genre it's classified under. But this is a drama first and foremost. Not only that, but it is perhaps one of the most mature and intellectually stimulating shows on television.

Perhaps if there is one flaw in this show, it's that it is unrelentingly dark. However, that is exactly why we watch...there is simply nothing else like it and nothing else dares to be.

I had the professional edition, usually what i get, and when I saw this saying student I thought that it would be missing some extra tools etc.  This is good not just for kids as others has been saying you can do just the same amount of work load and the profession and ultimate the same MSWORD, EXCEL, PP, it does not have outlook but if you dont use outlook not an issue, The others have publisher, accounting so those who use tht would be more geared for them.  The graphics screen is all blue, all the icons are section all in little segments [ex. edit would have copy, paste,etc.. all in that section visible so that you can see and you hardly even have to use the pull down menu] BUt I will say at first a little confusing trying to find the icons you are looking forward so many added functions, once you sort the screen the way you want it, than everything is a go. Everyone would benefit not just the kids. Im happy

Okay, I have lots to say and I will try to be organized about it.  I had never heard of an epilator before.  I was looking for a new electric razor and came upon them in my search.  I ordered an Emjoi and when it came it did not work.  I started researching after that and found many reviews that said Emjoi works well WHEN it works...so I moved on to Braun.  First let me say that Amazon has the fastest shipping and terrific customer service.  Now on to the epilator.  

First of all, the pain.  I am not a wimp...had my first baby naturally...on pitocin.  This process HURTS.  The first time I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to get through it.  But, I did one leg one day and the other the next.  My hair is course, medium darkness, but I have a lot of it.  I think I should have shaved and gotten the hairs and different periods of regrowth.  Although I used the trimmer, I was yanking a lot of hair all at once.  The worst areas were my ankles, inner thighs and behind the knees.  I found that my bikini did not hurt as much as other areas-perhaps because the hair is more sparse there.  Now, the second and third time I used the epilator the pain was decreased one hundered fold.  BUT...IT STILL HURTS-it is just more bearable.  This last time was even better....perhaps as the hair changes it will continue to get better.

Now...the results.  VERY smooth the first time, but not very smooth since.  However, the regrowth is so fine, that although I am not completely smooth, I ahve found I can last 7-9 days without a touch-up and it doesn't bother my husband or me.  I used to have horrrible stubble the morning after shaving.  I have used the electric razor part to smooth some problem areas out and it works better than any I have ever used.  The trimmer is also very nice.  I am too afraid to try my underarms.

Side effects:  I got a terrible red rash that clears after 24 hours.  That has also been getting better with each use.  But...don't expect to put on shorts right after epilating.  I got some ingrown hairs, but I got those along with horrible razor burn after shaving also.

TIPS:  Exfoliate before and EVERY day in the shower.  Pull your skin tight in the opposite direction that you are epilating...it eases the pain.  The roller head is a good idea for 1st timers, but if you can stand it, use the "experienced" head on high speed-the pain is reduced and it is much more efficient.  

I gave the product 4 stars because you don't get completly smooth for "weeks."  Epilation is not for everyone.  It is very labor intensive (my first time took me 2 plus hours) and it is painful.  But, I find that compared to shaving every other day and my razor burn and stubble from that I really like it.  The more I do it, the less I want to go back to shaving.  I first used this around Feb. 20th and it is March 19th and I have not used a razor on my legs since. 

The product itself is great...the attachments are nice and it works as described.

This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)

      



Forget the fact that it's a cartoon, Wall-E is simply one of the best movies I've seen.  Written beautifully, with seamless animation, and with direction that brings storytelling to a new level, this movie engulfs you into the life of one little forgotten robot.  

There is something so pure about Wall-E. There's not a selfish gear or wire in his entire little trash-compacting body. His only goal is to serve, help, and love - truly the most selfless character ever portrayed on the screen.  And as it turns out, he's the wisest character in the movie, simply because of the fact that he follows his heart. It's this kind of altruism that leads to greatness. Can one little robot save the human race?.....This one can.

In my eyes, he is one of the most hopeful characters on film.  He can be put in the same category as Atticus Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird, Andy Dufresne in Shawshank Redemption, or Roberto Benigni in Life is Beautiful. All characters that never give up hope because they see that life is indeed too beautiful to waste on selfishness and waste. And all characters that can reach through the screen and inspire the viewers to become something better than they are.  For Wall-E, not only is the glass half full, but he's always striving to fill the other half.

Wall-E's my hero.  Watch this movie and he'll become your hero too.

I got this scale to replace my previous digital scale which was hard to work.  This one is super easy, can be turned on and off with your toe!  The body fat feature seems fairly accurate though does vary somewhat from day to day.  The weight feature is right on and matches my doctor's office scales so no more five pound jump in weight when I see the doctor! You can get on and off this scale three times in a row and your weight does not fluctuate as with some scales. This scale feels sturdy and not flimsy (like the one I got rid of).

Slept in these sheets last night, with my eyes closed I love these sheets- I think that they feel strudy.  I ordered the cafe color thinking it looked like a nice coffee color, but it is more like a mustard or maybe burnt mustard.   That is nice if that is what you want, but doesn't go well with my browns and blues in my room.  Maybe they will look ok in my guest room.   I think the picture is not accurate- the color looks more true to life on this cafe:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HX4K7S/ref=amb_link_7864942_2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=hero-quick-promo&pf_rd_r=0HQRN37KWZR8HDNCCEMG&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_p=463857211&pf_rd_i=B000BB06OI

Although I too was enthralled by Twilight[ that explored the love between a vampire, Edward Cullen, and a mortal, Bella Swan]this sequel in my opinion is far better. Yes, like other readers, I too was disappointed that the vampires were not a dominant feature in this novel, yet the way the author wrote, you could sense their presence throughout the novel, so it didn't really seem like I missed them. This second novel explores the emotions of Bella as she learns to live on knowing she might never see Edward again. The main theme here is the friendship between Bella and Jacob and how that friendship is challenged not only by Jacob [who wishes more] but the knowledge that Jacob is a natural enemy of the vampires by virtue of his birthright [shall not give away too much]...suffice to say, the vampires do make a reappearance, and the second half of the novel does proceed at a quick pace with lots of thrills thrown in for good measure. I loved the way the author draws Bella's character, lovelorn yet strong-willed, courageous yet weak, Bella is a study in contradictions, yet we can't help but love her for she is someone all who have been in love can relate to. Her love for Edward is all-encompassing, and utterly believable even with the vampire/werewolf angle! I can't wait for the third novel, and it would be great to see Bella's wish to join the vampire clan fulfilled, and how she deals with the challenges...would it change the love between Edward & Bella...gosh, I'm getting ahead of myself, this is purely wishful thinking on my part. I highly recommend this author!

So far so good. I just received my Iomega eGo 320 GB FireWire 400/USB 2.0, I used the USB to connect, the instructions to format were precise, had no issues there. The only thing I wasn't happy about was that in formatting to NFTS I lost 21.91 GB, so almost 22, I had 298.09 left to use, while this is still a lot of space it means the drive is not as big as advertised. That is a bummer. I just got it and used the copy here from drive to drive (didn't use any software) and everything went well. I'll update in a couple of months as to how it's holding up. 
Although everyone else said it ran hot, I didn't notice any excessive warmth, it seemed to run cooler than my other devices. I think good price for what you get, but you will not get an entire 320GB.

I bought this laptop recently. First thing I noticed is that it is a polished shiny surface, not brushed like most laptops. Please be ready to have smudges and fingerprints all over this machine. 

Also, like a fool, I was confused into thinking the i.Link 4-pin FireWire port was a 6-pin FireWire port when reading the description of the laptop. So, my TB external drive will have to use one of the 4 USB ports instead of a 6-pin FireWire port. 

Additionally, there are no ports of any kind on the back, they are all located on the left and right side of the laptop. Just a head's up if you plan on using them all, wires will be spilling out on the sides.

This minilap does run a little slow with Vista Basic and only 1GB memory.  However, I upgraded mine to 2GB with the memory available here at Amazon (for an incredible price) and now am running just fine for what these are basically meant for (surfing & email).  I might add that I have installed Slingmedia's Slingplayer to connect to my Slingbox and have no problems whatsoever.  I now have a really neat "TV" on my kitchen counter or on the go using my own Cable TV service.  Giving 5 stars as it does very well what it is built to do.  This is NOT a desktop or laptop replacement but is a very easily portable "Netbook". I have not noticed problems with heat.  I would have gotten a system loaded with XP but did not want to take a step backwards. By the way, mine did not have Norton as HP advertises (don't use Norton anyway), but DID have the minicam much to my delight!!!

I have ripped 603 gb of TV shows and movies to store on this drive so far.  Before I got this drive, it would take about 26-35 minutes to copy one TV show disk to my laptop's hard drive.  It takes about 28-39 minutes to copy them to this drive.  I have a little netbook without an internal CD/DVD drive, so I have an external drive for that.  I have the CD/DVD drive and the Western Digital drive plugged into a powered USB 2.0 hub.

The point is, this runs fast.  It only takes a couple of minutes longer per DVD to run through the hub and into the WD drive instead of straight into my laptop.

I have watched some of the movies from the drive.  (The point was to store DVDs I own on the external drive, then copy a few of them to my internal drive when I go on vacation.)  I haven't noticed any drop in speed or any problems.

This does what it's supposed to do and I really like it.

I have a 1 year-old, 100lb black and tan coonhound that LOVES to bark at imaginary squirrels and raccoons in the yard. Honestly, the barking was out of control and I was starting to worry that I would get complaints from the neighbors. I tried this collar despite the mixed reviews and I'm thrilled that I did. I first time that I put it on him he only barked once and then he stopped after the spray. I let him outside and he barked again only once. I haven't heard a peep from him since! He's such a calm, pleasant dog now - it's as if he knows that the jig is up:)I don't even have it turned on most of the time and he doesn't know the difference. For me, this is a 5 star product all the way. I also use positive reinforcement when he stays bark-free. My trainer always tells me that frustrated, under-exercised dogs are the main reason why they bark. I use the Kelty Chuckwagon backpack with weights during our walks and that really helps burn off some energy too.

This is the most satisfying coffeemaking experience in my 50 years of drinking coffee. The unit brews very quickly and produces a smooth full bodied brew. The adjustable hot plate lets you crank the heat level down a bit, which extends the half life of the finished coffee and prevents a blistered toungue when waking from sleep induced dementia.  The lids snaps on securely and this pot never drips a drops.  The spout makes pouring a breeze.  It is possible to aim exactly where you want to pour and never worry about dribbles. Hitting the fill ports for the water reservoir,is easily done with the pouring ability of the carafe. After two years of frustration witha faulty KitchenAid units, I could not be happier with this fine coffee instrument.

I just finished watching the seven episodes back-to-back.  

The story of John Adams and his contemporaries is something young people in the U.S. need to understand.  Unfortunately, I can't recommend this for children and young people because of the graphic nature of the tar/feather scene, the amputation scene, and the surgery scene.  I understand that graphic scenes are something adults are supposed to tolerate (although I don't tolerate them well), but it's wrong to expect children to handle those scenes, even if they see graphic violence in movies and games.  

Was it necessary to show the saw hacking through the limb?  And was it necessary to show the breast surgery in graphic detail?  For that matter, was it necessary to show John and Abigail celebrating their reunion with a quick nooner?  It felt gratuitous, like because it's an HBO movie they had to be sure to include enough blood and toss in some spontaneous sex, but unfortunately these scenes make the movie unacceptable for the audience that would most benefit from understanding John and Abigail.

Well done series for adults, great acting (although Thomas Jefferson was wooden), powerful score, but I learned more from the book, and enjoyed the ride every word of the way.

We've been using Ooma since Feb 20, 2009 when our previous phone number was ported to the new system. Set up is easy and the system works well; initially we had some issues with voice quality, but I upgraded our Bright House cable modem service from the basic Roadrunner (7 Mbps) to Turbo speed (up to 15 Mbps) and it seems to have solved the problems. Voice quality is good now, and my internet connection is faster also, for another $10/month.  Overall it seems to be a good system.

The movie is fun to watch.  It's not too serious but it isn't campy either.  The effects were top notch and the Robert plays a great Stark in my opinion.  The only thing I sort of dislike is the ending, the bit after the credits.  It reminds me of all that crossover nonsense that happens in the comic books which really kills comic books for me.  Plus I find Samuel a tough actor to like now a days.  But that's just me.

I had a Braun (recognized name) conical grinder which went south, so I began looking for something just a bit more substantial.I wanted to avoid the multi-hundred dollar grinders favored by some of my coffee bretheren.  95% of my coffee is ground for a French Press; the remainder is for my MokaPot which requires a finer grind, but not as fine as for an espresso machine. I read the newsgroup rec.coffee and saw this grinder mentioned. It is substantially built and priced just right. Any concerns about static build-up causing the grounds to cling are put to rest by simply adding two (count them, two and only two) drops of water in the whole bean reseviour.  I don't consider it noisy and it does not wake my wife when I grind at 0530. Just in case, I've put a mouse pad under the unit to further deaden any noise.  I've had this unit for a month and am very pleased with it.

This show is simply one of the most exciting and interesting on television today.  Battlestar Galatica takes traditional science fiction and blends it with modern drama in a way that I found completely unexpected and amazing.  Fans of SciFi will eat this show up- as I have; and fans of great drama will also find Battlestar accessible.  The show itself can be described as a mix of Band of Brothers, the movie Aliens with elements of the original Battlestar storyline.

What the writers and producers have achieved is a scifi story that seems more plausible than the typical entries in this genre.  No one will believe the story is real- don't get me wrong -but it seems more grounded in reality.  The series has a gritty edge, and tension, that is not usually present in scifi.  The writing also sticks to the main premise, and only deviates if the new course advances the original dilemma: How will mankind survive?

I also like the conflict between the military and the civilian government.  This gives the series a chance to comment indirectly on some of the contemporary issues that we are currently facing today in the war on terror.  It also brings to life some 'worst case scenario' situations that are just entertaining to contemplate.  "Battlestar" does so in a fair manner that encourages discussion and thought, rather than a one-sided partisan argument.  

I do believe that the writers treated Crash Down unfairly in the first three episodes- he is the only example so far of a one sided character; in my 3 years in the military I have never met a single LT as obstinate as that.  That episode also neglects the perspective of an officer- it is more of a stereotype than anything.

The Second Season writers must have a new advisor on military matters, because the influence is hard to miss: digital uniform, modern military lingo (SITREP, OPORDER...).  It does the series well, and increases its grounding in reality.

Season Two picks up right where the cliffhanger on Season One left us hanging.  The rest of the episodes included are all great, and take the story in new and unexpected directions.  One of my fears was that they would not be able to match the excellence of the First Season, but this is not the case; Season Two is even more exciting and entertaining that the First.  However, don't be fooled, this boxed set is only HALF of the Second Season.  In a few months we'll be forking over the cash for the second half.

My only critique is that the pricing is a little high for only half of the season, and you'll be left craving more episodes.  But honestly, not having access to American Cable TV in Europe, I was so happy to see that I'd get my next dose of Battlestar, the price was not a deterrent at all.  Now, on the other hand, if the second half of Season Two is released with this first half attached, I will be a little irritated.  Purchasing episodes that you already have might be a pain; but trust me, after watching the first half; you'll certainly want the next installment when it is released.

I like it a lot, good features for the price. Provided hardware/software is weak, not much better online from Acer, can't understand restore options. Not that it's needed now but maybe in future if I hose it. Battery replacements are expensive, especially 9 cell option. More than half the price of whole unit. Overall, for its immediate use, a good buy. So far has proven reliable.

It's a super nice PC between a regular heavy 6 lbs laptop and less functional PDA.  If you aren't in world of warcraft raid guild and need to go for 25 men raid every day, it's nice small laptop for you to do many things and go everywhere because the convenience talks and that's what you paid for.

Because I could get 8GB more internal SSD space providing flexibility to install software or storage personal files.

I definitely think this is a good keyboard for those who want an awesome illuminated keyboard, but don't really want to spend lots of money. The keys are easy to type with and the glow is just right.

Finally my wife and I can have toast together with this 4 slice unit.  I bought it after reading the reviews: I'm very picky and was not going to spend a hundred bucks or more on a toaster.  My last toaster would not allow access to bread that was short in stature.  After toasting I would need to slam the handle up and while the toast was airborn I would retrieve it.
This thing toasts very evenly and bagels will actually taste good.  It just toasts on one side when you select "bagel".  You don't know how this will help until you try. Another excellent feature that is great is the "warm" setting. I try to get everything done at once and if the toast is done a bit too soon I can just pop it down and hit "warm".  Also, with just the 2 of us I usually keep the bread frozen.  I pop 2 frozen slices in this toaster, hit "warm" and by time I have the tuna mixed up and ready to plop on the bread it is perfectly thawed out.  I could go on and on.  In this case, you get what you pay for.  I wish I would have bought this years ago.

Going into this I knew it was more it expensive and other reviewers are right that it doesn't last quite as long as the box states, however I LOVE this product!!  I have begun buying a large jug of Tidy cat crystals and when I notice the crystals yellowing I change out 1/2.  It helps with the smell (almost none) and it only took the cats about a day to acclimate to it.  If you realize it WILL be more costly; that you need to clean out the droppings from under the trap about every 7-10 days (for 2 cats); and cycle in more crystals in lieu of throwing out the box then it will be a wonderful present for you and your cat!

if you are thinking about getting a portable dvd player don't bother and get this instead!  however if you know about the Eee PC and are thinking (like i did) that you are getting the lower end one so you can spend less money and upgrade it yourself for a quarter of the price, think again.  the 2G surf is not upgradeable like the other models but i like it so much that i plan on buying a different model soon.  i would recommend the 4G galaxy, it has enough internal space to do more and you can do some hack/mods to it.  there are a ton of things to do with it, and best of all they are easily found on the internet with step-by-step instructions.

The good:

We use the stage 4 diapers, and have been using Seventh Generation and singing its praises since stage 1.  I love that they are chlorine free. 

The bad: 
Recently they redesigned the tabs to be larger at the base (on the back) and narrow at the end (where it attaches to the front), and are also shorter, meaning that it's harder to put the diaper on securely, and they don't fit as well (although they don't leak unless they're /really/ full).

Secondly, they have decreased the number of diapers per package in the last month or so, from about 36 or 38/package to 30 per package, and they have also increased the price per case as well.

Finally, we joined the "subscription" program a few months ago, where you get a discount for subscribing to an automatic-order of at least one case per month.  I recently discovered, however, after buying diapers one pack at a time at the store, and hoping the diapers would arrive any day, that my "subscription" orders are a full 5-7 weeks back-dated on shipping, which really annoyed me, especially as I didn't receive any notice that they would be delayed so severely, or at all.

Summary: 
It would have been five stars, except for the recent design change and the subscription problems.

Just finished watching the Blu-Ray version of Wall-E and I have to say ... "WOW!"

Cartoons and animated movies like Disney's Cars and Wall-E REALLY shine in Blu-Ray and I really think that if you saw Wall-E or Cars in high def and didn't think or say "WOW" when you saw the picture and how clear and crisp it was then the whole high def experience is lost on you.

As far as the film goes ... I LOVED IT!  This, in my opinion, will become a true Disney classic!  I think this movie is appealing to all members of your family whether your 8, 18, 48, or 88.  It is cute, heartwarming, and despite the lack of speech on the part of the two main characters the movie is very funny!

This is the epitome of a "family film" and there is absolutely NO reason why anyone should not see or not be allowed to see this film.

So, if you're looking for a family film or even if your just looking for a good funny movie Wall-E is a distinct possibility for the evening!

ALSO, if you're looking to have your HI-DEF put into use ... pick up the Blu-Ray version, dim the lights, and have a "WOW" or two ready!

I have had gastric bypass and I have tried a lot of protein mixes and this one is the best every once I found this one I haven't had to try another one again. This one dissolves and isn't chalky. It tastes like choc milk. I use only non fat milk cause it does make your milk thicker and that's ok for me. I used to have this 3 times a day but now I only need it for breakfast and it is feeling and satisfying until I have my first break at work. And now that I found it on Amazon it mails out to me and I don't have to worry the store is going to be out any more and it was cheaper then in the store. Yea for me!  And it has very low sugar and high protein. Try it you might like it.

Wall*E - the new animated movie from those genuises at Pixar - you had me at hello. Seriously, from the first moment I saw a trailer for this, I knew my family & I had to see it. This is an EXCELLENT movie in every single way. Wonderfully positive messages for all of us are laced throughout the movie, which is something I greatly value in these types of movies, plus it's just a fantastic movie to watch for entertainment purposes. 

This movie has so much heart, I still feel Wall*E's hold on my heartstrings, I think it's permanent, and that is lovely. It is an interesting & topical story to start off with, a clear message on our environmental footprint and what the future could hold should our behaviors go unchecked. It is also a wonderful comment on respect and reverence for 'life' in all its myriad of forms, of working together, of love & companionship, of personal courage and standing up for what you believe in, no matter the odds stacked against you. I think, for me, its most powerful message is one that is echoed in other great stories (such as Lord of the Rings, for example) - that no one is too small, too "insignificant", to make a great impact on all of our lives. There is great power for positive change in the unlikeliest of beings.

Funny, sweet, touching, exciting, memorable. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

I will love Wall*E forever :)

This is our (my Daughter and I's - we're walking buddies, get one!) first Pedometer. Following the instructions to calibrate the meter can be more difficult than just measuring your stride! That's what I ended up doing. I'm still not sure if its correct, but I'm pretty sure it is. I look at the meter while holding it against my leg, and it tally's every step. It also detects aerobic steps! I believe that no matter what meter you have, you will have the problem of the meter adding steps you never took. I grab my meter and walk out the door and I've accumulated over 55 steps! Not so. Other than that, I highly recommend this meter! The software is really informational and will run not only the meter, but other Omron devices as well. This way, you don't have a separate software program for each. The meter comes with a strap and a clip that you can pressure clip to your clothes, and they've always worked flawlessly. Omron makes a good product. I also own one of their blood pressure monitors as well.

what can I say, I LOVE this ipod.  Not just that I have over 2000 songs with me at all times... but the games and the apps are wonderful.  I am not a computer gaming fiend, but I downloaded some racing games to find out how much fun it is to use the ipod as a steering device and I was hooked.  My four year old nephew and I spend hours playing on the ipod every Saturday.  I also use an app to monitor my diet and exercise as well as several apps that are just cool to look at when I'm feeling stressed or bored.  Listening to podcasts on my 45 minute commute everyday not only makes the time go by faster but I am really learning all sorts of cool new ideas.
Just get it.. you won't be sorry.

(Last paragraph added Jan. 14, 2008.)
I took a close look at about 10-12 external drives on the Internet, comparing capacities,  dimensions and weights and looks. Yes, looks were important to me because I intended the drive for travel purposes. After a business associate had his notebook stolen in the Hong Kong airport I decided that my notebook would never again contain my entire 'business office' again. I wanted a drive that I could put in my shirt, coat or pants pocket whenever leaving my hotel room, and leave only my notebook with the O/S and applications on it. You can move your Outlook.pst file, your Favorites from IE, anything you want, onto the external drive by right-click/drag/move these (and other) O/S folders to another location of your choosing. In terms of data files I decided to keep only my iTunes system on Drive C: and I put all other data files on the external drive. When traveling I keep the drive on my person at all times. If the notebook goes in the overhead compartment the portable drive stays in my pocket. Before leaving home for any kind of trip I first copy everything from the portable external drive onto a desktop external so that I lose nothing much if my traveling drive meets with disaster. I also copy the entire iTunes system from drive C: to the desktop external.
So, I really needed and wanted a small, light and good looking external drive that would not need external power, thereby available for use at any time. The 160GB Ego USB 2.0 by iomega fits the bill in spades. It's very light, looks like a million, no boxy sharp corners like all the rest, and is advertised as having special shock protection in case of being dropped. I'm not planning to do any end-user testing to prove this point. My wholehearted recommendation for this drive.
One more reminder for backups: you can leave the desktop backup at home when you travel, but when you return take the backup out of the house. Take the backup either to the office, or your detached garage, or some other off-premises location. A backup sitting next to your original data is protection only against hard disk failure. Other calamaties like a fire, or theft, requires that the two be separated a good distance. Hey, stuff happens.
Now the follow-up. I will keep it short. The first Iomega 160 Gig. drive failed after a month, went back for factory repair and it failed again shortly thereafter. Iomega replaced it and the second drive failed a few weeks later. I gave up on it, bought a Stor-It 320 Gig. (also red and pocketable, from pexagontech.com), and it has been performing flawlessly for over a year.

This DVD and the first My Baby Can Talk DVD are the very best media I have found for my daughter.  We started watching the First Signs DVD when she was 5 months old. During that month she started to sign "dog" (we have one and use the sign).  At seven months old she started to say (speaking) "dog" and "duck". By age one, the second DVD had come out and she had a signing vocabulary of about 50 signs and a speaking vocabulary approaching 100 words which astounded her pediatrician.  A couple of months later her vocabulary is just too big to count.  I am sure that watching these DVDs was instrumental in her early language development. We enjoy signing with our daughter but these DVDs are great for the spoken language development alone. However, when your child does start to speak, it is great to have him signing also because one can't always understand a child's pronunciation but it is easy to know what he is communicating from the signing.

My daughter prefers these to Baby Einstein, which she also likes, and always smiles when the music starts. The founder of the company said when speaking to my mothers club that they tested the footage with focus groups of babies to make sure that they captured babies' interest. It shows. They were engaging to her from the start and at nearly 20 months she still loves them.  These two DVDs are the favorites of my husband and I also.

I particularly like the use of "please" and "thank you" in the Sharing Signs DVD.  Although my husband and I say these words to our daughter frequently, we don't sign them very much. But our daughter does.  I am sure that her frequent use of "thank you", which she both signs and says was learned from the DVD. Sharing is a tough concept for a child her age but I am sure its use in the DVD will help her catch on early.

I appreciate the inclusion of the foods in this DVD because when transitioning to solid foods it is so helpful to be able to communicate with your child about what he wants to eat. I hope that future DVDs from Little Hands Productions will include more healthy baby and toddler foods.

These DVDs are my favorite baby shower gift now and I eagerly await future releases from Little Hands Productions. I have checked out many other signing videos/DVDs from the library.  These have a much higher production quality than most of the others, are much better and more engaging for infants and toddlers and, as nearly as I can tell, the signs are true ASL signs not made up.

For parents who enjoy these DVDs I recommend books from the Early Sign Language series which our daughter enjoys (kids love the photos of other kids) and helped us to learn more signs.

I have an OLD crock pot from the 70's.  I have been looking for a reasonably priced pot off and on for a couple of years that could do it all.  This is it.  If you don't want to spend the money on the comperable All-Clad pot, the VersaWare is the one.  I use the VersaWare at least 2-3 times a week.  We have an electric stove and I almost always brown the meat using the buffer grate that comes with the pot.  After browning the meat I usually turn the pot to high for an hour, then turn it down to low for the rest of the cooking time.  It is VERY EASY to use and clean.  I do not mind that I cannot see through the lid.  I have not refrigerated, microwaved, or baked in it yet.  This is a heavenly appliance.  It helps me make a good meal for my family without spending as much time in the kitchen.  I highly recommend this pot.

I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to enhance their fitness level! The heart rate strap fits just fine under clothing and the wrist watch is helpful. It is easy to use and seems to be accurate 95% of the time. Not only does it provide on indicator of cardiovascular exertion, but it is fun to look at during a workout! I am constantly switching back and forth between the stopwatch and heart rate. And I didnt realize this when I bought it, but when I wear the chest strap alone, several machines at my gym will pick up my heart rate. You definitely wont find me doing any cardio without my heart rate monitor anymore.

A few years back I bought a George Foreman Grill.  It was small with a timer and looked so cute, I thought I'd try it.  BIG MISTAKE!!!  I tried making a grilled cheese sandwich and then some sausage.  The grilled cheese took awhile and never did get crispy.  I put two sausages in next.  The one to the back sort of got done, the one in front kept falling forward because the machine is tilted.  Only half of the one on the outside ever got cooked.  I took it back to the store and got my money back.

So, now, my husband only has dinner with me on the weekends because he eats at work.  I didn't want to play with the gas barbeque as it's just too scary.  All that pushing the button and hoping it doesn't blow up my eyebrows!!!  But I needed a way to cook one chicken breast, one hamburger, two lamb chops, etc..   Did I mention that I don't like broiled meat??? So that wasn't an option either. I had been using an old aluminum fry pan with a little butter and shortening to get a great tasting base to fry my meat in.  Well that was no way to help me lose weight and eat healthy!!!

So I looked for a grill that I could depend on without remodeling my kitchen.  I originally thought of a panini maker but I wasn't sure if it would cook meat properly.  Well, I researched it on Amazon.com.  Seemed like most people loved this machine and a very few had some objections.  I spent the money, thanks to Amazon's free shipping and $25.00 off any kitchen item over $125.00. With free shipping and $25.00 off, no one else could beat that deal so I ordered it.  It took three days to get here and I was anxious to test it out.

I've had The Griddler for one week.  So far I've made two paninis.  I had bought some blah tasting french rolls for deli sandwiches and some really good, thinly sliced Black Forest Ham, Roast Beef, Provolone Cheese and Swiss Cheese.  Even with the blah tasting bread, the Griddler made a wonderful crunchy, melted cheese and meat sandwich. Can't wait to buy the good bread!

Tonight I thought I'd try a hamburger.  Remembering what one of the reviewers said about grease going everywhere, I took precautions.  I put the machine on a large bread board so as not to ruin my laminated countertop.  I also remembered reading that the food did not sizzle when the reader put it on the grill.  I read the booklet that comes with the machine.  It said to set it to Panini/Grill and the heat to High.  I waited between five and ten minutes and the machine was ready, green light on!  I seasoned my hamburger (premium, not the high fat kind) and put it on the grill.  Shhhhhhhhhh went the machine as the cold meat hit the grill!!!  It took about six minutes to get to medium and it was ready to eat!!!  I turned off the machine and unplugged it.  I did see smoke coming from the grill plates as the minimal amount of grease laid there burning with the top closed.  I had put the drip cup next to the drain opening.  I decided to use the plastic scraper that comes with the machine to push the grease down the trough into the cup.  I kept the cover closed for about five minutes and it cooled down.  I noticed that although it heats up quickly it also cools off quickly as well.  I checked for spatter around the outside of the machine and there was a little.  After all the cover doesn't come all the way down unless you want pancake hamburgers.  On the stove I would normally have splatters everywhere around my frying pan and the overhead vent fan would have to be on.  This is far less mess than frying on the stove.  By the way, the hamburger was fabulous!!!  

Well, I would recommend this machine to anyone who wants an answer to quick, grilled food without turning on the stove, the barbeque or the broiler.  It has already become a necessity for me to eat properly without the mess and without all the fat.  No more take out food when this is so good and so easy.  Going to grill up some eggplant next with some roasted red peppers and a chunk of a baguette.  Should be great!!!

This is a great machine and even though it's a little more money than others, it is stylish, well-made, heavy duty, non-stick, efficient and easy to use!!!  By the way, it also comes with a three year warranty.  Buy it!!!  You won't be sorry!!!

Easy to use, easy to clean, excellent results--what more can you ask for from a kitchen appliance?  Seriously, a 5 year-old child could make their own frozen treats, it's that simple.  Drop your ingredients into the bowl, turn the machine on, and 20-30 minutes later, Voila!My only complaint (and it's very minor) is that a thin layer of your dessert freezes to the bowl as it mixes.  When you're making a single, small serving of something, you lose a fair amount of it due to this adhesion.  The solution is simple, however:  make a larger portion!This is a great way to test your creativity in the kitchen, and a fun way to introduce children to &quot;cooking&quot;.  All in all, a terrific product.

I love my Cuisinart ICE-20 Ice cream maker and would highly recommend it to anyone. I have made countless different recipes in it, and this machine makes creamy ice cream in mere minutes. I have also partly frozen the ice cream and then layered a combination of flavors creating a stunning semifredo dessert. When you can get Cuisinart quality at such a reasonable price, why pay more? The only problem I had was that the ice cream was so good I wanted to make more shortly after and the freezer bowl had not completely frozen again. An additional freezer bowl is on my Christmas wish list this year!

This graphic novel has everything you could ever want. The characters are well-developed, if a little morose and deeply in need of therapy. The plot is complicated, with a lot of twists and turns. The morality is more complex than a four-colour comic, adding an extra dimension. The art has sometimes been mocked for being a little to realistic, but I thought it was quite good and I liked that the artist was obviously enjoying what he was drawing.So, why not five stars? Because it's not Eisner's "Into the Storm." That's all.

This is everything I ever wanted from an MP3 player plus more. By plus I mean 3 extra (BIG) features that the FUZE has and the Nano doesn't. That would be 1: microSD expansion slot ( I have an 8gb SDHC in mine, a total of 12gb ) 2: an FM Tuner and 3: The ability to record FM radio,  That means recording a favorite song from the radio and going back and listening whenever you want YES!!!! .  Another thing I like about the FUZE is that it's fully compatible with my Playstation 3 (the Nano isn't) . I pop in a CD and then import it into my Playstation 3 in MP3 format, then copy to my FUZE . The control wheel is easy to use as it actually turns and clicks so you won't over travel like on the Nano's very touch sensitive wheel. One feature that surprised me was the Podcast feature. I thought that feature was just for iPOD's. If there's one thing I don't like it would have to be the ON/OFF switch NOT button. It's a little hard to turn on and off with no nails. Overall, Im VERY satisfied with this neat looking, high quality, easy to use MP3 player and look forward on buying accessories for it with the $100+ that I saved on not buying a Nano.

I've had our U100 for about two months. I love it! It has the perfect screen size for my tired eyes (the white keys help with that, too). The way I use my computers, having both a wireless and a wired ethernet capability is a feature I appreciate. The hard drive is plenty large enough for me. The camera is great, too.

Soon after buying mine, I did do some remedial upgrades. I got a good quality Bluetooth dongle, added another gigabyte of memory, and a nine cell battery that gives it more than six hours of useful computing time. These upgrades cost about $100 in total. I hasten to point out, the upgrades weren't essential, they just made a good thing even better for my situation.

My spouse used the webcam to talk with her family overseas using Google talk; she said it was just like being there. Her happiness by itself totally justified the purchase!

The MSI Wind series has an enthusiastic following of computer hobbyists. They have discovered many ways of enhancing the U100 for everyday use. Because of this following, I don't think the Winds will soon join the ranks of orphaned hardware.

For those unfamiliar with the MSI name, I've bought their system components for years and always have been pleased with their quality and the way that MSI provides continuing support.

This grinder is at the lower end of the (good) Burr variety, but it does its job admirably. The first time I turned it on I was surprised of how quiet it was; that's not to say you should grind your beans in the bedroom while your spouse is sleeping, but it would be ok to run it in the kitchen at 5am and not have your neighbor knock at your door.

The actual "on" switch is a mechanical timer dial with arbitrary numbers 1-10. I found that unexpected if not unnecessary (on-off would have been fine), but I guess you can look pretty cool setting the dial to "3" so it grinds while you get the milk.

The produced powder is flawless as far as I can tell. It makes perfect single-shot espresso on my Gaggia Evolution when set it to level 1 of 4 on "finest" grind (which, in turn is the finest of four levels, the coarser ones being for drip coffee). In case you're still on the fence, it does make a difference to have your own grinder. I found that pre-ground espresso coffee turns a little bitter after 3 days or so, whereas your self-ground beans last quite a bit longer.

I am owned by four adult cats, all shelter rescued.  Since their beginnings were less than grand, I try to make their lives as happy as possible without going to extemes.

This fountain replaced a less-expensive one, and I've never regretted spending the extra money on this purchase.  When I'm cleaning the unit.........about every two weeks will do it.........my cats lay right where the fountain always sits.  As soon as I've finished the job, all four cats line up for the first drink from a freshly cleaned fountain.  Because it just makes sense, I also bought the large reservoir.  I refill it once every 5 or 6 days, and I've got a family of happy kitties!

As hardcore gamer i really depend on good hardware. During my gaming times I owned several mouses/pads. This one is for my stable homme gaming station. It is big aluminium plate, double sided (speed vs accuracy) I am acctually using the accuracy one (less speed) with compensation via the mouse skates so it is like on speed one side. 
I am not recommending the wireless mouses (even i am still using one), the aluminum somehow interference with wireless mouses, so i faced several problems with Logitech MX500. Which was solved by decreasing the length between the wireless base and mouse.
The exactres gell is really good one, it handle your hand for hours, the gum layer is also really well fitting the rest of the pad so it doesnot move on table.

PS: for mobile lan parties I use "Thunder8" aslo double pad but it's from "plasstic" with mobile case and little bit smaller than the razer.

Let me start by saying that this setup is not for the typical gamer or the flight simmer that likes to yank n bank.  This setup is more for fans of Flight Sim, and other more "serious" simulators out there that focus more on reality than action.  That being said...For the price this setup cannot be beat.  I treated myself to the CH Yoke Pro USB and USB Rudder Pedals about 8 months ago, and I am still greatly enjoying them today.  I probably paid about twentyfive more for each (Fifty total) at that time, but even at that price it was a great deal considering the quality and entertainment I've received from them.  I've always been a big fan of flight sims and I must say that this rig in conjuntion with MS Flight Sim 2004 is the best commercial flight sim there has ever been.  The level of realism increases immensely with the use of the yoke and rudder pedals.Also, with the number of buttons and levers on the yoke, you almost don't need to use the keyboad at all.  Just about everything you need is right at your fingertips; Throttle, Mixture, Prop Pitch, Gear Up/Down, Flaps Up/Down, 8-Way View Hat, Rudder Trim, Elevator Trim, plus 4 other misc buttons to do more stuff with.  Note that all of the buttons and levers can be customized to anything you like.  MS Flight Sim immediately recognizes this yoke and sets it up with a default set of controls that does just about everything you need.Another really nice feature is the rudder pedals have independant variable braking (something I didn't know that real planes even have) which means you can break the left and right wheels independantly.  This is done by each foot pedal being pushed in the typical way a gas or break pedal would work on a steering wheel setup.  This is not only used for braking, but also as an aid in steering.  Of course the pedals also slide forward and back for rudder control, all exactly the way a real plane works.  This adds an even higher level of realism that no joystick can reproduce.A review would seem biased if I didn't mention something I didn't like about the product, but I can honestly say that I am perfectly happy with it, and have nothing bad to say.  The yoke and pedals are built solid and meant to last, and the performance is flawless.  So all I can say is if you enjoy flight sims, or if you're toying with the idea of getting your pilots license, then this setup is a must.  I have no regrets on my purchase, and it's even cheaper now.  I hope that doesn't mean they are going away, but if it does make sure to get one before they do.

I am surprised that so many people didn't like this book. I thought it was a wonderful end to an amazing series. I am an avid fantasy/ Sci fiction reader and many parts of the story that people disliked so much have similarties in the supernatural worlds that fantasy writers create. It's a supernatural world, one that doesn't function the same way our world does, and many people in their obsession with the series forgot that. What some of the readers are so disgusted with, would be horrible in our world without a doubt, but when your writing about a world with vampires, magic, shapeshifters and other magical people anything can happen and people have to realize that. 

As mentioned by quite a few other reviews many of the spoilers that reviewers wrote were taken completely out of context...avoiding the explanations and story that Meyer included in the book that make everything ok. 

So story was a little too "everyone with a happy ending" but at the same time other than one or two minor charactors happy endings that i thought was pushing it, i thought the story was very well thought out! As for people's complaints that these happy endings never happen in the real world... hello this isn't the real world this is a fantasy novel, life ending as a misery is not neccesary and makes for depressing reading. 

I loved the story and i thought it was a great ending to a relaly good series. My recommendation is to read it without the prejudices of all reviewers (mine included) and form your own opinion!

I hope you enjoy!

This is a great pedometer and worth spending the extra money on. It is accurate and has a lot of features. I wouldn't buy one of the cheapies or freebies, they are no good, they are not as accurate as this one.

This is a great pedometer. The highlight is that it can register steps in any vertical postion. Meaning even upside down it will count steps. As long as it is not flat it will count steps. The belt clip sucks...don't even waste your time. But the little clip can attach to anything and is very strong. The best thing is that the pedometer makes you want to walk or take the stairs just to get more steps. Its best if you get 2 and give one to a friend or partner, its literally a healthy competition.

This is the best laptop I have ever owned.  The keyboard is small, but big enough to type, even for my husband.  And there's a friendly community that can help you tweak it (www.eeeuser.com).  It fits in my purse and I can take it anywhere - I use it to type notes in class.  It will also fit in larger suit pockets or jacket pockets.  If you don't like the Linux OS that it comes with (Easy Mode), you can change it to Advanced Desktop or even put Windows XP on it.  If you're new to Linux, you can still use it, and if you're an expert, you can tweak the you-know-what out of it.  Finally, a laptop that you can take everywhere with you!  Definitely worth buying!!!

I only bought this product because I had a gift certificate to spend. I wouldn't otherwise have been able to justify the expense for a mouse pad, especially when my old one, that I had been using for well over a decade, was still working just fine (by which I mean it was still just lying on my desk doing what it does). But now that I've used the Exactmat I can see that it would have been worth purchasing, even if I had to put down some cash for it. I wouldn't have believed that there could be such a difference between a "normal" mouse pad and this one. But truly, there is. I don't quite know what to say except to encourage you, if you use your mouse as often as I do (pretty well all day every day) to give it a shot. I bet you'll be as amazed as I am. It actually makes a difference in accuracy, speed, and everything else you expect your mouse to do for you.

This review is from: The Princess Bride (VHS Tape)

      



I was in a video store looking for something to rent when I saw the newly released &quot;Princess Bride&quot; on the shelf. I knew nothing about the movie except for a magazine snippet about the main swordfight outlasting the one in Errol Flynn's &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. (Such thin threads!) I took the movie home and watched it 5 times straight through (not an exaggeration). This movie is in a word- CHARMING. Is it the best movie ever made? No. Did it have problems in editing, make-up, dialogue and other places the critics are so quick to point out? Yes, but I am of the mind you should find out things for yourself- research, but make your own decision. This is a beautiful love story, told in such a way that it is a completely unbeleivable fantasy and a totally credible account all at the same time. It is one of those kind of movies you need to watch to understand. I was fortunate enough to see this movie on the big screen at college several years after first watching it on video. It was fun to sit in a room of people who knew the movie inside and out, and could quote the dialogue along with the characters. (It was like a live showing of &quot;Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;- which I also recommend.) We cheered for the good guys, whistled at the Princess and booed the Prince and the Count- and you almost expected the people on the screen to react to you. That is only part of the charm of this movie- that it draws you in to the point you feel that you are part of the action. They say a picture is worth a thousand words- this is no exception. A written review cannot possibly tell how good or bad something is- you should always find out for yourself.  One last thing- do read the book. I like the movie plot better, but the book does fill holes in the story line, which makes the movie that much better the next time you watch it. If you want a recommendation, you have it from me.

It's a really great movie.  The greatest performance Heath Ledger do.  Regretfully, he died.  The only thing that I don't like and is the same thing that I don't like in the originals, is that the villans in Batman always ends in Arkham or prison, not dead.  In the originals, The Joker, The Pinguin, "Catwoman" (maybe) and Harvey Two Faces, all of them died.
In Batman Return Raz Al Ghul and now again, Harvey Two Faces, died.  That's is the only thing that I don't like.

This is my first experience with mp3 players, and I am very happy with it.  I have debated between 4 and 5 starts, however, as the documentation is a little sparse.  The click wheel took a little getting used to, and sometimes I will rewind a podcast all the way when I only intend to backup a minute.  Nevertheless I really like compact size and the logic behind it.  It is great for catching up on broadcasts when you are on public transportation, and music/sound quality is great also.

I own a white dog that I show.  I had tried every possible home remedy for preventing and removing tear stains.  He hated the Apple Cider Vinegar....and I hated having to apply homemade bleaching paste to his face every night.  He eats only a prey model raw food diet, so I was very hesitant to put him on something with antibiotics in it.  But after the umpteenth wrestling match over trying to get a teaspoon of vinegar down him I caved.  And I'm so glad I did!  He's been on the Angel Eyes for about 3 weeks and the tearstains are only a shadow of their former self.  I did have to continue to bleach the existing stain, but there is no new staining fighting me for control of his white facial hair now!  I will recommend this product to anyone fighting bad tear stains....the OTC and home remedies are worthless.

One minor peeve is that I'm glad I was warned in other reviews....the bottle comes about 1/2 full.  It's still a lot of product, but if I had been expecting a full bottle I would have been seriously miffed to find it 1/2 full.

After my beloved MX1000 mouse died on me, I decided the Microsoft Optical Mouse I had sitting in a drawer was such a burden I needed a new mouse, bad.  
Here comes the Sidewinder to save the day, its natural weight is pretty good, however I've loaded it with 3 of its 10g weights, and this mouse is great, smooth switching between DPI settings, the side buttons which I originally thought would be in the way, are actually well placed, I have yet to click them on accident. The scroll wheel is great also, while I am disappointed it was not a free wheel like the MX Revolution, It has a good feel to it and it is simple but not too much so to click the middle mouse button.

This makes a great tasting cup of hot coffee.  I recently purchased the Cuisinart DCC-1100 12-Cup, White.  I had a Westbend for 8 or 9 years and that made good coffee, but it just stopped working after Christmas so I bought a Black & Decker 10 cup, but it did NOT make the coffee hot enough. After 2 mornings of not so hot, not so good tasting coffee, I read on-line reviews and the Cuisinart 1100 & 1200's seem to have the most that said it makes HOT coffee. I didn't realize that coffee needs to be brewed hot to taste good. I had never thought about it because I had my old one so long and I took it for granted that all coffee makers make good, hot coffee.  This Cuisinart DCC 1100 makes great tasting coffee, very easy to use and program.  It also looks very nice.

This video has some great moves, you break a sweat and it gets your heart rate up but apparently you have to be quite a bit overweight or new to exercise to lose 5lbs per week.  If you're trying to get rid of a stubborn 10 or 15lbs, this isn't it.  Jillian is much more pleasant in the video than on Biggest Loser but still comes off as somewhat cocky.  I find most of my other videos to be much more motivating and upbeat and they make me actually WANT to do them instead of going to the gym.  You WANT to push for say Cyndi Whitmarsh or Violet Zaki as they are much more encouraging eventhough tough.  I gave it 4 stars bc I don't feel this video alone (or even combined with No More Trouble Zones) is sufficient for weight loss.  Your calories either have to be severely restricted or you need to add something else to your routine!

The included sample pack is excellent, as well, because one can quickly determine the style of K-Cup one likes best.  For me, the bold varieties are superior to the regular and medium blends.  The milder blends taste a bit thin.

So far, I have not used the 9.25 oz. cup size.  The 7.25 oz. size delivers just the right flavor.

I also ordered the My K-Cup.  While not nearly as convenient as the prepackaged K-Cups I can create very nice, robust brews relatively easily with the My K-Cup.

The only con is the large size of the brewer.  It takes up quite a bit of space on the counter.  Its size, though, is a minor issue considering the hot, fresh, delicious coffee the machine produces.

Every episode in this season really hit the mark for comedy. About Last Night which featured a great parody of the "Real Story" behind the election was priceless with all the hype going on. The Tribute to the classic movie Heavy Metal is an episode I have watched plenty of times on XBOX Live.

This season of South Park is a must own, almost more so than the other seasons. South Park is evolving from a funny show to a comedy classic. Watch this season and you will find out what I mean.

My first review is below and this is an update after more than two years (January, 2009). The machine still works perfectly -- I use it very often and it always turns out a great loaf of bread. The instruction booklet cautions against adding anything to the mix not mentioned in the recipes, but I sometimes ignore that -- being prudent but feeling free to throw in a little something now and then. For example, I often add a tablespoon or so of chocolate powder or instant coffee to the white-bread mix, which gives it an added flavor that I enjoy. Overall, this is a quality machine, built to last (and it has) and easy to maintain. I would also add that I still see NO reason NOT to use the "rapid bake" for regular bread every time -- I can't see any difference between the 2-hour and 4-hour loafs.

********
My unit just arrived today and I opened it up, quickly read the instruction booklet, threw in the ingredients -- and 4 hours later out popped a perfect loaf of bread. I'm impressed. Sure, it's just one loaf -- and we'll see how it goes as I try different recipes and the unit ages. But right out of the box, it worked perfectly.

Ok, so, now more than two months later, I can report that I use the machine at least three times a week to make all kinds of bread and it has NEVER failed to produce a great loaf. I found that the 2-hour cycle is just as good as the 4-hour, though the French bread requires six hours. My favorite has been the focaccia -- the machine makes perfect dough which I then bake in the oven. The machine has performed flawlessly and is a snap to clean up. I liked it so much, I bought my sister one for Christmas. If anyone writes a review saying they don't like the machine, either they are using it incorrectly or have a defective unit because mine works flawlessly.

I'm 23 and have been using PCs for about 15 years.

In terms of the competition for this laptop, I've had my hands on everything from Sonys to Dells to Toshibas to HPs, everything. This computer puts every one of them to shame in literally every category.

The speed is just amazing. Out of the box it rates a 4.5 out of 6 by Vista (most similarly prices models rate a 3). It can be overclocked from 2.0ghz to 2.4ghz, yet the thing never heats up. I compared it directly with a more expensive Dell. I ran a particular high demand program. The Dell could not run it. This computer ran 4 instances of it. That means this thing is at least 4 times as capable as a more expensive, bigger name computer. That's what happens when you put an AMD processor on an MSI motherboard against an Intel on some generic Chinese motherboard, the Intel will always fail in comparison.

The touch pad actually works, it's fast, and it doesn't misinterpret anything. Out of the dozens of touch pads I've used since their invention, this is the only one I can't complain about.

It's the lightest 15.4" laptop I've come across, yet feels so solid that I know it's more durable than any of the alternatives. Even has some aluminum construction which isn't just aesthetic, but actually aids in cooling. Probably one of the reasons this comp never overheats.

It doesn't come loaded with a bunch of useless programs that try and steal your money (AOL etc.). It comes with what you need, Vista, and drivers that work.

I have literally found no downside to this computer except that it isn't free and that it took me 15 years to find a computer I have no complaints about.

My son is 9 months old and in size 3.  The diapers don't seem to contour to his body as well as the smaller sizes did.  He's walking and constantly on the move, and they don't seem to have much flexibility.  I love Seventh Generation as a company and would still like to support them with other product purchases, but think that I might try a different brand of diapers next time.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)

      



Here's something to think about. Ever bet the farm or your last dollar on someone you thought would never leave? This was such a sure thing that the word failure never came up in your mind. What would you do if it happened? When your heart shatters into a million pieces and falls right through your toes and into the dirt. What would you do?
 When we left Bella she had a prom dance with Edward and everything was close to normal for a vampire and a regular girl. I know some of you think that Edward and Bella took huge gulps from the same bottle of corn syrup before they spoke to each other it was "too sweet for words", but they were in that special place and I'm sure there are a few of us who wound up with someone we thought were way out of our league and thinking back wondering if we swooned way too much for our own good. Where love is involved nothing is impossible.
 New Moon is every bit as good as the first book, Twilight. Bella doesn't go on a drinking spree when Edward leaves, doesn't find God or even dye her hair she just puts one foot in front of the other and soldiers on like a ghost or zombie. A few side projects that lead to a friendship with Jacob Black starts and things drift back a bit to normal until Jacob begins to run with a gang, but is no replacement because your other half is still gone. Good heart felt writing in this book - like when Bella says she is a moon orbiting around a planet that no longer exists and being in love only gives the other person the power to break your heart. Oh I could go on but that would spoil it more for you if  you want to read this book and oh yes expect a few surprises and a cliff hanger ending too. It's a great read and the next installment can't get here quick enough.

I really wavered between between buying a license to iWork 08 or Office 2008 they're both so good. Although much easier to use, iWork 08 just didn't have all the features I needed, plus I get a lot of Word and Excel docs from colleagues on PC's (you can easily import MS Office docs into iWork 08 but then you have to continually export to return them back).

Office 2008 is very polished and I really like it. Although the price is almost twice the price of iWorks you actually get three licenses in the pack which is a major bonus.

If you are a professional user, need all the MS Office features you had on the PC, need to exchange MS Office documents with other Mac and PC users, or you have at least 3 Macs in your household I would say that Office 2008 is the right choice. Otherwise iWorks is more than adequate for the casual and less demanding user.

I love Huggies diaper.  The feature I like the most is the stretchy waistband, the best out of every diaper in the market.  Also, these diapers absorb wetness quickly (reducing leaks) and feel dry even when wet (reducing diaper rash).  The Baby-Shaped diapers (with Lion King characters) are now Snug and Dry (with Mickey characters), they are considerably softer than Baby-Shaped (inside and out), and the waistband has more folds than before so it is even easier to fit the diaper around baby, which is great.  Other than that, they haven't changed much, and it is still the same great product, just getting even better.

I have tried Pampers Swaddlers, Pampers Baby-Dry, Luvs, White Cloud, CVS, Especially for Baby, Top Care and I regret not having tried Huggies before I tried all those other brands.  This is by far the best diaper out there.

We love this wearable blanket so much that we bought every kind. They are wonderful. First I must say that they, obviously, do not confine the arms, so if your baby still gets startled by her jerky arm movements when trying to fall asleep he/she may not be ready for this yet. I am slowly making the transition from the Miracle Blanket over to this. My baby still needs the extra swaddling at night and when she is fussy, but she likes the freedom during her naps that this provides and likes to get at her fingers too. 

I did not find that my cotton sleep sack shrank. The zipper doesn't lay exactly flat on her, but I haven't found this a problem at all.

I do feel the sizes run a bit small. My baby is wearing the small size and at 23" has just about outgrown it. I'd recommend getting them one size above what you think you need.

I don't like that there are no arm sleeves at all. I really would have liked the choice of putting her in one with or without sleeves. 

This cotton is so nice and light (I wonder if the other reviewer was reviewing a fleece, flannel or quilted one instead) that I can't imagine it being any lighter without being to fragle to hold together. 

I very much like that the zipper is "upside down". It undoes from the bottom which means you don't have to completely unzip your baby for diaper changes and the zipper tab doesn't poke into the baby's chin.

These are made in China of course, but are excellent quality and fit at a very reasonable price. They were even cheaper than comparable sheets for my queen size bed that I'd purchased at my local Sam's Club store. It's rare to beat Sam's on price, but when it does happen it's usually @ Amazon.
These seem to be made specifically for Amazon, since "[...]" appears on the packaging and labels.

I had read the first three books when I took a peek at Amazon's ratings and was shocked to see that some fans hated this one. What on earth had gone wrong? Had Edward decided he'd really rather kill Bella, after all? Had she shrugged off her true love for a career in corporate finance? It was with relief and great satisfaction that I read "Breaking Dawn" and found my favorite characters getting what they wanted most.

Maybe it's because all four books were available when I started the series. There was no long wait in which to come up with my own notion of what would happen next, only to have it conflict with the author's choices. Once a book leaves the writer's hands, it becomes the readers'. Each person filters the story through her own experiences, tastes, desires, etc. Some seem to think a great love story has to end in tragedy. If that were true we wouldn't have the heart to invest in characters and to enjoy the delicious suspense as an "impossible" love tries to conquer all. Even Shakespeare, creator of the ultimate romantic tragedy, gave most of his lovers their happy ending.

The most baffling criticism to me was that the characters didn't have to sacrifice enough. Excuse me? Were we reading the same story or is sadism the new empathy? Edward's entire life has been about sacrifice and his natural reaction still is to take everyone's problems and responsibilities on himself. In a less colorful way, Bella's had to suppress her own needs and desires, curtailing childhood to prop up her flaky mom and clueless, if lovable, dad - not because she's a victim, but because she genuinely loves them despite their shortcomings. Although she's smart and brave, she's never really had the chance to recognize her own strengths or develop confidence - until she meets Edward, which doesn't exactly spell the end of her troubles. A lot of broken bones and a venomous chomp later, she's still risking everything for the people she loves, finally blowing off an entire "normal" life just to make things work. Even agreeing to a wedding is a sacrifice from Bella's point of view; her experience has left her suspicious of the whole marriage thing, but she knows what it means to Edward's more Victorian sensibilities, so she goes through with it - for him. Personally, I think there's been more than enough sacrifice from these two; they deserve their reward.

I saw that some readers objected to the baby, but the reason these books have been so successful is that despite the mythical elements, we can identify with the characters' feelings, and for a lot of us the ultimate experience is putting on the earth a new human being who is part you and part the person you love most in the world. I'm glad they got that too. (Not to mention, enduring the world's worst pregnancy ought to put a couple of points on the sacrifice scoreboard for poor Bella.)

Other readers objected to Jacob's imprinting on what's-her-face. (Sorry, I find that name hard to pronounce - even in my head. It could be worse; they could have named her Britney.) I didn't see that coming at all and thought it was a delightful resolution to the Jacob problem, one that was foreshadowed all along.

So I'm grateful to Stephanie Meyer for providing a pay-off that both her characters and at least some of her readers could appreciate. This is a series I'll read again, knowing I won't be disappointed in the end. The course of true love never does run smooth but - at least sometimes - it ends up where it should.

Anyone who is planning on getting married should see this movie before they take their vows.  Those that are having problems whether dating or married should also.  Families who are struggling with conflict with parents or siblings can also relate. Friends, who are true friends can be identified by the instructions show in this movie.  If we loose sight of our Creator, we loose sight of self.  If we really want to succeed, there is no half-way.  Very well done and you don't have be of any religious demonination to appreicate the uplifting values demonstrated by this movie.  I give it an A .. WELL DONE, A MOVIE TO OWN.

Being that my previous Norelco trimmer (a T770) took 10 hours to fully charge, I greatly liked how the T980 took just 70 minutes to do the same thing. And I just LOVE the mini-beard trimmer attachment!! Now I can trim my beard line, mustache and sideburn hair (with the help of vacuum power) without having to worry about a HUGE mess to clean up!! And the turbo power option? The 30% increase in vacuum power it provides helps out in situations where you have to hold the T980 in contorted, odd positions  to get the job done (i.e. upside down), and you don't want hair that's being cut coming out of the device.

In short, the Norelco T980 is a BIG improvement over the trimmer that I used to have!! And the price was pretty damn reasonable, too!! I definitely feel that I got my money's worth when I purchased this product!!

This movie is about a struggling marriage and the distractions that so easily could harm almost any marriage.  It can be intense at times, but has humor in just the right spots.  It is said in the movie that fireproof doesn't mean that there will never be a fire (in your marriage), but when the fire comes, that you will be able to stand together through it.  Very true.  Our vows are for better or for worse.  Love your spouse and God bless!

When he wants video games,stories are for babies says the child.As the story gets more exciting little Ben Savage gets into it,by story end he has learned his Grandfather is as magical as the story he reads. All in all, THE PRINCESS BRIDE is for all ages. It is a favorite of my teens and my young adult children as well as my 4yr old grandchild.,This is well worth keeping on your shelf at the ready to be viewed.

The Lacie 1TB external hard drive is simple and elegant.  It runs whisper quiet, so you hardly know it's there.  Actual space out of the box is about 945GB, plenty for backing up everything and then some.  It has two fire wire connections on the back, so you can connect to multiple PC's simultaneously (one USB and one eSATA also).  The included software allows you to make partitions for both your Mac and Windows PC.  It's really nice that it came with all the cables, but each is only about 2 feet long.  That's my only gripe as this is now the third Lacie drive I've owned, and all are still working perfectly (two 250GB drives have been in regular operation for the past 4 or 5 years).  For $150, the 1TB drive is a steal!

After a lot of research I chose the Breville 1000-Watt Juice Fountain because I knew that if it wasn't easy to use and clean I wouldn't use it often. I've been juicing with this at least once a day, often twice, for 6 weeks now and I absolutely love it. I mostly juice hard vegetables, like beets, carrots, parsnips, etc., plus leafy greens like watercress, parsely, wheatgrass, spinach, etc. There is no sign of wear on the filter basket and I've had no problems with leaks, flying vegetables, etc. (The guy who has fruit flying over his head is clearly not using the food pusher that comes with it. I use this no matter what I'm juicing, and it's impossible for something to fly up out of the machine and make a mess.)

I recommend that people read the directions first, as there are lots of good tips. For example, even though it's advertised as being strong enough to juice pineapple with the rind on, the directions clearly don't advise it. For leafy greens they advise bundling them or sending them down with another fruit or vegetable. This works great. I was surprised at how well this juices wheatgrass and parsely as long as I either roll it up in a lettuce leaf or stuff it between two halfs of another vegetable or fruit. This machine juices very quickly, with a good yield and leaving pretty dry pulp. The tube is very large so I don't have to spend a lot of time cutting up produce -- most of it goes down whole or just cut in half. This is a huge time-saver!

It's a breeze to assemble and a breeze to clean. I don't bother with the dishwasher. As suggested in the directions, I line the pulp basket with a bag, so there's no clean-up there. After juicing, I immediately rinse off the food particles and soak the parts in a sink full of soapy water. Then I just rinse them off and let them air dry. The brush included does a great job of cleaning the filter basket, but you have to clean both sides. I love that there are no tiny nooks and crannies where food can get stuck -- everything is easy to clean and it's a snap to put back together for the next batch of delicious juice. I am really happy with my decision to purchase this particular juicer.

Well, after 1 day of drinking coffee until I'm shaking, I have to say that I did not make a bad choice in buying this wonderful maker.  My wife and I are the only two in the house that drink coffee and our schedules are so different that making a whole pot is impractical.  We had a small B&D single cup but it was a royal pain to fill, wait for the coffee and then clean.  

With the Keurig, we can choose what we are in the mood for.  She can have her cup at 6am and I can have my travel mug at 7am when I leave for work.   Even at the largest brew size the coffee is still very respectable in strength and flavor.   I may try some of the other K-Cups that were recommended for stronger flavor in my large mug. 

I was at first, a little surprised at the loudness of the motor but considering that you don't have to fill the container for days that's not an issue.    I've programmed it to turn on at 5am to heat the water and to turn off at 7:30am after I've left.   With the Auto Off feature, we can also turn it on if we're in the mood in the evening (waiting 3 minutes for it to heat up is nothing) and we can brew a perfect cup for ourselves or even if we have people over.  I love how you can have the rack and allow each person to select their own private cup of coffee.   An hours after the last brew is done, it then turns itself off. 

The only negative that I've see is the in-ability to drain the internal tank easily and that you have to use it (not a problem with us) at least every week or Keurig recommends that you flush the tank going though 4 cycles.  

My wife is also a heavy tea (bag) drinker, so not having to wait for water to boil on the kettle is a very big plus as well!

We have a male Samoyed with a gorgeous, super dense, thick coat.  He had fleas once and it was a nightmare!  We started using the frontline and it is a wonderful product. Never saw another flea again! It is very easy to apply. My dog gets excited when he sees me pull the package out because he knows a treat is coming when I am done putting it on him!!! On the tick end...We have land in WV and in the spring and summer the ticks can get pretty bad. If we find a tick on him, it is either dead or just crawling on the tip of his fur. It will not dig down inside of his coat because the frontline kills it....and if we do happen to find one inside his fur, it is always dead! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to eliminate dealing with fleas or ticks. IT WORKS!!!!!

I own the matte black version of this coffee maker, no fingerprints like you sometimes get on stainless steel. Although it is a tall unit, it fits under the cupboards above, the only problem being I need to slide it forward to lift the top lid to fill the water. But this is a minor issue for me, since I love this coffee maker more than any other I ever owned. It keeps the coffee really hot, right up to the last cup. The pot doesn't dribble when you pour a cup, and it's a good sized pot. The replaceable water filters are inexpensive, and if your water is great you probably could go without the filter. I will never buy another cheap coffee maker again!!

The only problem i've noticed, which isn't really a problem is the blue led's are so bright that they bacically act as a nightlight, so if this were in your bedroom it might be hard to sleep. It's not in my room so its not really a problem for me, just thought i would mention it. I actually got this at wal-mart for only $75, so i would recommend getting it there so you can easily return it if you have a problem.

This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) [HD DVD] (HD DVD)

      



Transformers has raised the bar on special effects!! The robots looked spectacular with all their moving parts and intricet detail. The story line wasnt half bad either, making Shia Labeouf's character have a reason to be interacting with these aliens. The action sequences with the batteling robots is where it lost me though, well probably because there wasnt alot of it, especially the final battle between Megatron and Optumis Prime. Everytime there was going to be two robots getting it head on, there would be a pan to another event happeing with the humans, it's like Bay & Co. were afraid to tackel the commitment on making robot battles in complete sequences. But other than that that's my only complaint. It was fun from begining to end. And yes it is better than Armaggedon, as was said by some random kid about the meteor hitting near, where he was standing. Way to poke fun at yourself Michael Bay. I also noticed that the camera shots used in this film were a lot like the ones used in Bad Boys 2...any thoughts on that? I guess I could see Optumis taking down some Hatians in Miami....Enjoy the movie, be a kid again.

This is an excellent attachment. Very first one that we bought and is  essential as we make lots of Indian cooking like Koftas, Kebabs and Tikkis. If you compare the price of minced turkey or chicken in the Super Market, you will find this product very useful. It works very good and there is no negative points to highlight. You can use it for all type of meats uch as chicken, turkey, lamb, beef etc. We are glad to have this gadget. I can say that the ROI on this gadget is not more than 6 months. Must buy product.......

Because the violence in this film is not as overt and tasteless as that in most American movies, this is one of the most effective horror movies I have ever seen. Since few thought-provoking horror movies have been produced in the past decade, this one may seem weird, but it also shines brightly, engaging both the heart and the mind.  No comparison to "Twilight" is possible--this may not be as romantic, but it is at once more true and more intelligent, its use of symbolism stunning and moving.  It left me questioning where the boy's fantasies of violence end and the vampire attacks begin.

"L錿 den R鋞te Komma In" is being remade by an American director, so I recommend you see this before Hollywood kills it. This is a perfect example of what horror movies should be.

As a person who doesn't care for earphones or status symbols anymore, I was reluctant to purchase an IPOD. After much homework, I ordered it and I love it because I can easily transfer music from one place to another. I would rather have it an inch longer and a 1/4 inch thicker. Also, it should come with a cover case and recharger. Other than this, it is perfect!

We had a great time with the little Flip Video Ultra Series Camcorder -- and for a low-cost, MPEG powerhouse, this is the one to get! For action use like surfing or skateboarding, its ease of use and quality capture is unequalled! Mac users can view clips in QuickTime Player (Pro). Or import the clips into iDVD. Edit and burn DVDs with full iDVD functionality.

This camera beat two others in the hand-held, pocket sized video camera category. It worked immediately with computers without software or even reading any instructions. It works exactly as you would expect as opposed to many of those with cryptic, non-intelligent user interface and controls. NO, it is NOT a network broadcast camera, so don't expect NTSA quality. YES it does produce surprisingly good image and sound -- and it's PERFECT for YouTube and other video blogging purposes. 

And, if you take a spill and land on it when you hit the pavement, it's cheap enough to toss in the trash and pick up another one!

My husband is the breakfast cooker in our home and I got the Oster 4716 egg cooker for him to try instead of the "boil on top of the range" type cooker. He absolutely loves it. He prides himself in poached eggs on toast and the eggs are cooked just right and slide right off the poaching plate. He tried the hard cooked eggs and the shells just slid off the eggs.

The results were great for the pets.  It was a hit with my mostly-Siamese cat, who loves to lounge in the sink and begs water to be run on her for "spot drinks" and will drink faucet drips even if they're almost a shower.  And, once my Sheltie decided it wasn't going to bite her, she liked it, too.  It beat her dog bowl that seemed to collect every bit of hair and debris that made it that far.  And they both seem to prefer the fountain's filtered water to nasty local tap water.  (I don't drink it, so why should they have to?)
  And that she delayed may have been my fault.  The pump made a lot of noise 'til I turned it on full force and got it filled properly.  One must remember the capacity of the reservoir means you have put nearly half a gallon of water in it for it to run right!  The blue reservoir holds about a cup or so, and will have to be filled several times.  If you can hear any sound from it, you need to add more water to the reservoir, which is easy to do even as it's running.  My rule of thumb is that I refill the reservoir 'til it doesn't bubble and drain out if I find it low or I can hear the pump running.
  I haven't had to clean it yet, and almost dread that, because my major trouble was getting it apart at the outset to assemble the parts that weren't set up.  If you have problems with arthritic hands as I do, it can be a little aggravating, but it's do-able.  To clean it, I'll try pipe-cleaners to get into the intakes, but keeping debris out of it in the first place makes frequent cleaning less a necessity.  I'd have given it a higher rating if not for the difficulty of disassembly, but somebody without arthritis would not have that trouble.

I'm the proud owner of a digital SLR. For professional looking artistic shots this is what I recommend. But the large sized D-SLR is not convenient for those less formal spontaneous photographic moments such as when you're out with friends or when you're on a vacation and wish to relax rather than document. I needed a small light and uncomplicated point and shoot camera for those unexpected photographic moments. This fit the bill perfectly. I took mine for it's maiden voyage during a weekend vacation in London. As far as the photographs go the 7.1 mega pixel resolution pleased me quite a bit. The 16:9 aspect ratio was a new feature to me in still cameras and is my new favorite feature in the still photo department. 

But unlike any other still camera that I've used before, this one features the ability to capture 720p HD video at 30 frames per second. This coupled with a fast 8gb SDHC card will land you 28 minutes of highest resolution 16:9 aspect ratio video. Considering this is not a video camera that is excellent. This space is perfect for those moments where you would like a short video to merely capture a moment rather than document an event as you would with a actual video focused product. For instance a few minutes of myself and friends in the Absolute Ice Bar in London. Or the belly dancer in the next bar/lounge we visited.

Ultimately I found the camera small, fast and uncomplicated for my level of technical ability which may be higher than the average consumer. I'm what is known as an early adapter. If you wanted to perform tasks such as manual focus and manual white balance a person would be frustrated with the task though not impossible without leaping through a few hoops. But the quality with the quickly accessible features are excellent and I have already recommended this camera to others.

I've had this hard drive for a few days and I have it hooked up to my Dell XPS Laptop. My notebook is very very quiet and this hard drive is a little noisy when you have dead silence. It is very small and cool looking. It stays pretty cool temperature wise as well. The light in the front is much less bright than the previous versions of Western Digital's hard drives, and I like this one much better. If the hard drive is in sight though, the light can get a little annoying because it is pretty much always moving around and pulsing. Speed wise it is one of the fastest I have used. And I am using USB. 

The coolest feature I think is how it starts up and shuts down with you PC. Very handy compared to other hard drives I have owned. 

One small problem that I have run into is that when I shutdown my computer, it doesn't always recognize this hard drive when I get back into Windows. I mostly just put my notebook to sleep, when it wakes up, the hard drive wakes up with it and works great. But for some reason when I shutdown and start up again, it never recognizes it. I have to unplug it and hook it up agian. A little annoying, but I don't shutdown much.

Overall, I would highly recemmend this hard drive. Granted I have only had it for a few days, but it has suprized me in speed and reliablilty.


UPDATE... This hard drive crapped out on me after less than a month. It just stopped working and I lost all of my information. Really really sucked. DO NOT BUY!!!

I honestly expected a $35 novelty item.  However, the Drinkwell is whisper quiet, effective, and simple to maintain.  Our cats love it and are drinking noticeably more water as a result.  The big "con" is that there really is no reservoir to speak of; we find that daily refills are necessary to keep up with evaporation and the cats' thirst.  The add-on reservoir is a must if you want to go more than a couple of days without refilling.

I'll just keep this short and sweet -- I love this litter box because it is so EASY to clean.  I have five cats that use three of these litter boxes.  I used to let the old litter boxes go a few days before cleaning them (because it was such a smelly hassle), but I would have to completely change the litter.  Now, because cleaning the rolling box is so easy, I can clean them daily.  Cleaning all three boxes takes me FIVE MINUTES!  And now my litter lasts longer because I'm cleaning the boxes daily!  I highly recommend these roll-and-clean litter boxes for *all* cat owners.

Amazing build quality. I worried that it would be janky and wobbly but this thing is ROCK SOLID. Has predrilled mounting holes for my G25 Racing wheel, along with the pedals and shifter (with additional shifter adapter). It comes with the bolts for mounting the G25 (and I suspect other lower-end Logitech wheels), as well as plenty of velcro and zip ties. However, I didn't have to use a single piece of velcro for my setup. The zip ties... well thats one of only two complaints I have. You have to zip tie your cables along the frame, which I would have rather of had the option of running them inside the frame to totally hide them. My other complaint, with the G25 you have a clutch pedal and the bar that supports the wheel obstructs my leg a bit. It's not a big deal, and I would not let these two complaints stop you from purchasing this thing. I still give it a five-star rating simply for the build quality, rock solid design and providing EVERYTHING you need to mount your wheel setup. Except apparently for that XBox 360 Wheel, but an adapter plate is available. If you have a Logitech wheel of any kind this is a must have. I have the know-how and ability to design and build my own setup like this but it would be difficult to match the quality for the price they are selling this for. I mean this thing has some quality steel but is still light enough we can push it out of the way when we're done playing. One warning though, if you have tile or hardwood floor make sure you buy a rug or the Playseats matt to throw under it because there isn't any padding under it.

I am very excited as this is my first Netbook, and it's probably the best one that you could get in the market at present time. Samsung pretty much took the best features from different brands and makes of Netbooks, and cramped them into this one nice and tiny package.

Pros: The size and weight is great. Strap this into your backpack and you're ready to go. The power brick is tiny as well. If you're always travelling or on the road, but you don't want to lose touch with people over Skype or any IM engine, the in-built 1.3MP webcam and microphone work great! With 5-7hours of battery life, I think this is totally a deal breaker. The network adapter picks up any available Wi-fi signals really well. Bluetooth is also a bonus, considering this feature is absent on the european versions.

Cons: The touchpad is too small and takes a little more effort to get comfortable with it. It's quite responsive, and the single-button with a rocker in the middle works okay. The glossy coat on the surface of the outer casing is a finger print magnet. The white NC10 with matte finishing works much better IMHO.

Breaking Dawn was an awesome culmination to a great series. Kudos to Stephenie Meyer for writing such an amazing book. For those of you who are cutting it down, remember this: you didn't create this world and you can't determine how it ends. Many people were unhappy with the ending of Harry Potter, too. Just because it didn't end the way you wanted it to, doesn't mean it was a horrible book. Part of the great anticipation I had waiting for this book was seeing which way she would choose to end it. I loved it and I'll read it again and again just like the Harry Potter series.

I have SMA type III which causes my muscle strength to deteriorate.  I have been looking for a workout with no impact yet would strengthen what muscles I do have left.  This workout does just that.  It also shows modifications if you are not strong enough which is right up my alley.  I have just moved to the second level and it's kicking my butt, but I love it.  I feel so good afterward.  All of the yoga stretches do wonders for all of my tight muscles.  I highly recommend this dvd!  I have been recommending it to my friends and actually bought one for a gift for a friend.

I just finished watching Let The Right One In and I was impressed,especially with the actors who played Oscar and Eli(the fact Eli is able to finish a Rubik's Cube is impressive)


The movie says a lot without being overly gory,unike past films in the genre.Some may be a bit weirded out between one particular scene between Eli and Oscar,but (not giving away any plot points here) there's a logical reason that the relationship is purely platonic.

Sweden is used well as a backdrop for the film(during the time the movie takes place,there is almost always snow on the ground)

The last few minutes of the film are jarring(the scene  at the pool is one to make you go "Oh.My.God."). The ending is a bit up in the air(I wouldn't be surprised if there's a sequel in a few years' time).It'll be interesting to see what the American remake is like.

I have owned the WRT54G from Linksys for several years and have operated on their 1.4.2 version firmware.  It has performed admirably until now.  It started to drop the internet connection and not let me ping or surf into the admin web interface in the unit.  I flashed the firmware and upgraded to version 4 which is stable and works great.  You get more features and you can configure this unit manually in many ways.
That being said, despite the fact that other users are giving it a bad review, it IS a consumer model, and NOT a PRO-sumer or professional piece of equipment.  If you want extreme flexibility in a router or switch or Wi-Fi AP, then get a Cisco router or other pro-level piece of gear.  People have too high of expectations for cheaper equipment.  Its not the way it works folks.  You get what you pay for and this unit goes from $50-100 bucks.  A professional piece of gear goes for in the $thousands of dollars range.  This unit offers great price and flexibility given the price.

All those cooking shows made me buy this.  I have always admired these kitchen-aid mixers... but never thought I'd get THAT much use out of them.  I watched a cooking show... where they made chocolate mousse.  That was the last straw.Now I can't say how glad I am that I got this!  My cookie dough is done as fast as I can measure out the ingredients! I was too lazy to mix the dough well before... so I rarely made cookies.  The first week this was home I made 3 batches of delicious cookies, an angel food cake, a meat loaf, mountians of whipped cream, and the chocolate mousse. Clean up is easy too.  Plus this cool chrome-esque color looks awesome in my kitchen.  Only now I'll have to join a  gym.

Used these kettles in England on my vacation. I loved them and had to get one when I came home, everyone had one there....Boiled a full pot of cold water in 5 min. It took 11 for my non-electric kettle to boil with hot tap water. Nice and fast. Boiled a whole pot first and poured it out to clean it then made a cup of tea. The mesh filter comes out to rinse. The lid opens all the way if you hold the button down and push it up, so you can get your hand in to clean it etc. The handle is comfortable to hold and it pours well with no drips.

I recommend this kettle. It has a 1 year warranty and Braun is a good name.

The movie was good, but the book was much better.  They had to cut so much out of the book to turn it into a movie.  My husband went to the movies with me without seeing the movie and said it was a good movie but it did not have the same impact on him as it did me because he did not know the background.

...this is a great product!  We (my husband and I) have had ours for five months and love everything about it.  It's convenient to use and makes GREAT coffee.  We fill the "hopper" and when we want to make coffee (which we do every morning) we turn the dial to how many cups we want to brew and it grinds the perfect amount of beans.  NO MEASURING, just  one step:  turn the dial.  Then we pull out the cup that holds the ground coffee, dump the grinds in the coffee filter, push "on" on the coffee maker, and put the cup back in the Capresso grinder.  It's that easy for tremendously flavorful coffee.  (note on coffee:  we've been buying dark roasts because they have the most flavor.  However, the darker the beans the less caffeine, so we make the coffee "strong.")  Anyway, I've read reviews on here that elaborate on how difficult it is to clean etc. and I just don't get it.  I don't want to offend anyone but those reviews sound compulsive to me.  If you slide the cup in, which is easy, then the grounds go into the cup.  The cup is very easy to clean.  What else do you need to clean?  I suppose if you want to use this only occasionally like once a month or less you may not want to brew the grounds that have sat in the burr grinder all that time and it could be an issue.  If that's the case I would recommend going with a small grinder that better suits your rate of consumption.  I have never needed to empty the grinds from within the machine so I can't tell you if it is difficult to get them out or easy (like tipping a toaster upside down and shaking it.)  One suggestion would be (for example if you go on vacation) to grind enough beans to push the old ones out, and throw the old ones away.

If you're just a regular person who likes great coffee on a regular basis, or you want to give a grinder to someone who drinks coffee on a regular basis as a gift, buy this with confidence.

My recently adopted, very excitable dog has had the collar on a total of
maybe 3 hours over two days. Already, *without* the collar on, he has
absolutely stopped barking at (a) the vacuum cleaner, (b) the neighbor's
perpetually yapping (instigator) dog right on the other side of the
fence, and (c) squirrels (real or imagined) in the trees behind the
house. The transformation is absolutely beyond belief. Get over any "I
don't want to hurt my baby" thing you may have going on - I did too -
and buy this product if you have a barking problem. I'm floored by how
effective this thing is and wish I'd known about it years ago. I realize
that training isn't complete at this point but I've seen instantaneous
and really dramatic improvement. Good luck and I hope you have even half
the success I'm having with this product.  Note to those who got a defective one - try again!

Added 2 days after my initial review - it gets better!  Tried this on my other young dog, adopted a month or so earlier, who is pretty good about barking except while I'm preparing her food.  Then, she barks like crazy and runs back and forth.  It's cute and no problem at my house, but it's not cool when we're visiting my mom's apartment in a retirement community.  I stuck the collar on her before starting food prep tonight and got two (count 'em!) barks during the entire prep process.  Normally I wouldn't be able to count the frantic, nonstop barks during food prep.  This change was astonishing.

I have become more aware of the need to be on top of things since I have two relatively young and energetic dogs.  They may go from a "barking's not good now" situation (barking at the fence at passerby) to a "barking's OK now" situation (chasing each other around the house) pretty quickly.  You need to be ready to take off (or put on) the shock collar at such transitions during training.  But I'm finding that even occasional concentration on this is yielding bigtime resuts faster than I would have ever believed.

Yes, Sonicare electric toothbrushes and their replacement heads do cost money.  It's money very much well spent.  My gums no longer get sore from recession from vigorous tooth brushing.  I used to brush over vigorously with soft bristle manual toothbrushes and it wore at my gum line.  Now I use the Sonicare Essence and no longer have that problem.  Not only that, but my teeth feel cleaner than they ever did using a manual toothbrush.  I don't have ANY cavities either (27 years old) - been using since I was a teen.  So I only have to go to the dentist for prophalaxis (cleanings) and checkups/X-rays.  So basically, the money you spend on prevention saves you the money you would have spent on imperfect fixes to oral health problems.  What's more "painful"?

I have tried many pedometers over the years and this is by far the best one.  It is very accurate and counts steps even in your pocket or purse.  It has the added feature of counting aerobic steps while keeping track of total steps seperately.  I must have tried 8 diffierent pedometers prior to this one.  This one wins best pedometer by a mile!

On the plus side this waffle maker makes great waffles -- the adjustment lever actually means something (although I find I need to set it on the higher side), it heats up quickly both initially and, especially, between waffles, and cooks quickly, too, not to mention evenly, and it stands on its side when not in use so is really easy to store without taking up a lot of room.  The negatives are (1) no chime when it's ready, just a light that switches from red to green, so you have to be close by, although you don't have to be looking at it as it makes an audible click when it switches; (2) no on/off switch -- it goes on when you plug it in and only goes off when you unplug it; (3) the plates don't remove for cleaning so all you can do is wipe them down, which wouldn't be so bad if there were some kind of tool that fit in between the grooves -- all you can really do is wrap a paper towel around your finger and try to wipe in between, not easy to do unless your fingers are tiny; and (4) the setting lever is pretty flimsy and easily dislodged.  Unless you make a lot of waffles, this unit is probably adequate for your needs and a nice price for an appliance that only does one thing.  If you make more than a batch a week, I'd recommend spending more and getting a more sophisticated unit, but if you're new to waffles or only make them occasionally, this is a good start.  As others have mentioned, spraying the unit with no-stick cooking spray or brushing with melted butter or oil is a necessity.  And as an aside, if you want something other than your standard white flour, really sweet waffle, the waffle recipes in The Splendid Grain (especially Strawberry Blue Corn Waffles and Overnight Coconut, Millet and Buckwheat Waffles) are super tasty and good for you, too, as they use all whole grains and little or no sugar.  Happy waffling!

What I love about this machine is that I can set it to always come on about 20 minutes before I leave for work.  Then, when I'm racing around in the morning grabbing everything because I'm late, it's simply a matter of grabbing a K-cup, tossing it in the machine and hitting the brew button.  In less than a minute, my coffee is ready and I'm heading out the door.  I always brew it into my jar thermos Thermos #2330 10 OZ Stainless Steel Food Jar for quick coffee on the go that I can drink on the way to work or at work.

After a long search for an egg cooker I was pleased to find this one.  Wow!  I am very happy.  The cooker works well and I can enjoy poached eggs every day.  Living at high altitude and a very dry climate, I had to adjust the water markings slightly to get the perfect egg.  I have since ordered another egg cooker for my brother.

Just for everyone that worries about picking up the blu-ray becaues of the aspect ratio change...get it! The IMAX scenes look amazing and it is not at all distracting. It adds to the movie for sure!

I have had several pedometers and most of them have been either freebies or inexpensive purchases. I got tired of 2 things: 1, having them fall off and get lost, and 2, inaccurate readings. The Omron addresses both of these issues and gives some bonuses I had not experienced before.

First, the Omron has a back-up clip that latches securely to your clothing. The "holster" clips on, and the strap has the second latch that is very secure. It will NOT come undone by itself.  No more lost pedometers.

Second, the accuracy: you must set it up accurately to start with. Most important is gauging your step length. It took me a few tries to get it right, but I would vouch for its accuracy now that I have it set right. You do have to be careful not to rely on inches but feet+inches - it can be a little deceiving. But get that right, and you will know how many steps, how many miles, etc. you have walked.  It also records your aerobic steps by taking pauses into consideration - stop too long to water your dog or chat with a friend, and the aerobic measure pauses until you have resumed a steady pace again. 
I have a Garmin Forerunner that is great for outdoors use, but often walk in an indoor track where I have no satellites to measure my distance, so the Omron is my tool of choice. Also since I don't always have a waistband to clip it to, it even measures steps while it's in my purse or handbag.

I just finished reading Watchmen for probably the seventh time. I have a few books I have read repeatedly (&quot;The World According to Garp&quot;, Updike's &quot;Rabbit Angstrom&quot; series, &quot;The Stand&quot;). I  revisit these stories because they touch some emotional chord. Watchmen  still resonates that chord. All good literature (for that is what it truly  is) challenges your perception of the world, and asks you to look at what  your belief system entails. Beyond that, Watchmen challenges you to ask why  YOU are the way YOU are today. The Dark Knight Returns has a similar feel,  but is more one-dimensional (Batman) contrasted with the multiple character  elements of Watchmen. If you enjoyed this book, there is an anime video  tape you would also find appealing, &quot;The Wings of Honnemaise&quot;.  It, too, will evoke that feeling that you had when you were  &quot;into&quot; the world of the Watchmen.

Along with all the other twilight books in the series, i finished Eclipse within a day. SUre all the books are great, but this one was my favorite. Bella is annoying at times and lacks confidence,but overall the characters are intriguing and the plot is quite entertaining. 


Jacob comes off as the adventerous careless one which is why i think most girls despise him. They get the feel that he is just trying to steal Bella from Edward from the moment he turns into a werewolf. Edward is the "dream guy" that all girls wish they had and despise bella for having. He says YES to anything she wants and never wants to hurt her. Bella is the whiney, annoying, clumsy, yet so desperate to be loved one. i liked her in the beginning of New Moon, but she just has some qualities that would be best not mentioned.

While reading this book i fell in love with jacob only because you can't really blame him for being the way he is. I blame it all on Bella for leading him on in times of need then turning him down as soon as edward returns. He basically ammuses me throughout the book with his wittiness and rude, but true, comments.Of course Edward is lovealble too, but i refuse to take sides. 


It is very upsetting to see all the negative comments on Stephanie Meyers books. Especially on this specific one. Her first novel was based on finding true love. The second one went through the path of Losing true love. and the third was supposed to be focused on Choosing between true love. I felt as if i was facing the same situations at times. Jacob brings most of the Humor in the book which is another reason why i loved him. Edward was more for flattery which in my opinion, Bella didn't deserve. The murder mystery in the book and the rising events kept me on the edge of my seat, turning each page until i found myself almost crying on chapter 26. The ending of the book was what made me want to buy the fourth book right away! it ends in jacobs perspective which i think shows the readers a little bit of an understanding side to Jacob Black and what he has to go through. 


People who have high expectations should really just drop it. dont expect anything. just read it not based on a review by some angry people who couldn't relate, but because you feel drawn to such a fantasy. It shouldn't be read by people who judge too much on what a person is doing. there were moments where each character pissed me off in some way but i eventually got over it by the actions they took furtherwise. 

COmedy mixed in with fantasy and some relativity. It has a high dose of enthusiasm and a whooping "OMG WHAT JUST HAPPENED!?" in it. Hhahaha its a really great book and i recommend to anyone who has an open mind to new concepts.

I have had this router for about 2 weeks now and I am very pleased with it.  The set-up wasn't quite as helpful as I would have liked, but with a little patience, it set up after about 30 minutes.  Have not lost a signal once and get coverage all over the house and even out to the back patio.  Highly reccomend this router!!
