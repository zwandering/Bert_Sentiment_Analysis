<review id="5000">Although the documentation indicates that you are able to stop the wireless network from broadcasting the SSID, the option is not available.  I contacted Netgear and they agreed that this was a problem and it was going to be fixed in the next firmware release.  They stated that the firmware was in the final days of testing.  That was two weeks ago.  The ability to stop broadcasting the SSID is a basic security feature.  I would not purchase this product until the new firmware is released.</review>

<review id="5001">I really tried to like this book...but I just couldn't. I loved the rest of this series, but this book did not meet the caliber of the others. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was because it gave me some closure. My problems with the book have been re-stated by other reviewers, but here are my main concerns:1. The charachters were not consistent with previous books. All charachters should develop, but they should still maintain some consistency. I felt that the charachters in BD especially Bella were completely OOC. Also, it became hard to relate to Bella after she becomes a vampire. Your book is in trouble when you can't relate to the main charachter. P.S. Do not start calling main charachters by nicknames like "Jazz" halfway through the book. 2. Rosealie takes a huge roll (arguablly the least likeable charachter in the series) while main likeable charachters like Alice and Edward take a back seat.3. Bella has a baby. This story had so much potential and lost all of it the moment that Bella had the baby. It took all the focus off the main charachters and put it all on the baby (don't even get me started on the name) and Rosealie and Jacob. Jacob was probably the only consistent charachter in the novel, and even he became "creepy" by the end. I saw the imprinting coming, but still "ick". He could easily have ended up with Leah and still had a happy ending. Despite this not so wonderful plot twist, Jacob still came out as one of the most likeable charachters, where in previous books I didn't like him as much. In previous books I was completely in camp Edward and by the end of this book I felt like I could care less about Edward or Bella. Jacob was one of the few "developed" charachters in the book. 4. No one had to work for anything. Even in fairytales people make sacrifices and face obstacles. In this story all Bella had was a difficult birth (which shouldn't have been able to happen) and suddenly everything works out. Even the Volturi are completely impotent. 5. Lastly, I am not completely comfortable with the message this book sends. I was looking for a light read, but the messages in this book are really negative. No, I don't believe that teenagers will now run off and get married and have babies young because of this book but it is still not a positive message. "Hey kids! It's okay to get married and have no life outside of your spouse. You too can have a baby to support, mansion, and fabulous cars without the benefit of a collsge education." I was expecting a light and fluffy read like Twilight which would bring me closer to my favorite charachters and provide a satisfying ending to one of my favorite series. In the end I was given a conclusion that was not satisfying and the sense that there was so much potential for this book and this series that was completely wasted. I still love SM but this book was extremely dissapointing.</review>

<review id="5009">If your main need is to have something that can make 8 GB of files portable, then this is a pretty good value. If you are looking to use Vista's ReadyBoost function, this drive is too slow. If you are looking to run applications off the drive (like Portable Firefox or Disk Utilities), it is also incredibly slow - and you'll probably want to look for something that has faster rated reads and writes.For my needs, this turns out not to have been the right drive. For you, well it depends on what you're using it for :-)</review>

<review id="5010">GOOD PARTS: Something about this movie made me want to see it to the end. The selfishness that ruined the marriage was well portrayed. And of course, I wanted to see the struggle and renewal. I love focus on the husband character as the one who, like Christ, has to suffer for the wife, the Church. Like the Church, the wife is not too deserving. (I don't know what he sees in her, she winces too much.) BAD PARTS: The script was cornier than a bag of tortilla chips and almost as preachy as the 700 Club. I was expecting Kirk Cameron's "dad" character to look into the camera and offer to heal somebody's lumbago. The action was predictable; so much more could have been done. For instance: instead of smashing the computer, Kirk could have taken it outside to smash it and then said, "What's wrong with me? This thing's worth money!" Then he could have called the newspaper and placed an ad. Then he could have set it back down in its old place and looked at it, feeling tempted and realizing that the safest course would be to smash it. A little more realistic for a guy who has been hoarding money for a boat. Unf. most of the solutions are just that easy, especially the "getting saved." God comes down Deus ex machina and makes everybody a nice decent Christian. Interesting how the very sympathetic best friend gets around the question of his divorce and remarriage, which Christ clearly forbids in the gospel. (It doesn't seem to apply to saved people.) The Christians are glossier than Currier and Ives. UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS ESSENTIAL TO THE MEANING OF MARRIAGE:The film does not even mention contraception. The childlessness of the couple is unexplained as if fruitfulness is some side issue unessential in Christian marriage.A parallel can be drawn about their spiritual lives. They now have the pleasure of being with God but where is the fruitfulness? The sun shines down on an empty, barren cross. God did it for you, go back to your McMansion and have fun. What about taking up our cross and following him?</review>

<review id="5011">I was so distressed by my lack of connection to this book, even though I couldn't wait to get my hands on it, that I was driven to write this review.  I am almost 30 and read mostly well-written adult literature, but was drawn to this storyline which reminded me of things I enjoyed reading growing up...the dangerous and dramatic love affair, the complicated love triange, and a twist of the occult.That being said, I really enjoyed the first three books and finished each in a few days.  I was so drawn to the Edward/Bella relationship and felt such a strong pull of my own emotions as I pictured so vividly everything happening in the book.  I connected with the characters and the storyline and couldn't wait to see the conclusion in Breaking Dawn.Breaking Dawn was not only a huge disappointment for me, in the way that everything was wrapped up so perfectly in a sickening, unrealistic bow, but I kept thinking the whole time I was reading, "Who are these characters?" and "I can't even visualize or connect to them at all."  This is what really ruined the book for me, because the connection and transportation into the exciting love story was what really made me read this series.Along with my general disappointment,(**spoilers ahead**) I am more than disturbed by the many negative messages and unrealistic treatments of endpoints for young readers.  Pregnant at 18, really?  But more than my initial shock, I found the inclusion and handling of this storyline to be ridiculous, impossible and that it didn't go at all with the characters.  And the Jacob twist, gross and totally would never happen in real life with real love!  As an adult, I know that the storyline wrap-up here is complete garbage, and while I was expecting and wanted a happy-ever-after for Bella and Edward, including her becoming a vampire, I could have written a more realistic and yet still satisfying ending myself, seriously.  I was sad that there was nothing really of the Bella and Edward magic from before (Jacob, too). I really wish I could just forget that I ever read it and imagine my own ending without all of this convoluted, poorly written trash.  Sorry Stephanie, but this one needed a serious rewrite.</review>

<review id="5012">This device has an annoying thermostat that keeps turning on and off - not mentioned in the product description. It has a light on in the front that is permanently on as long as the power cord is connected - it does not tell you if the coil has switched off. The only way to tell is to keep checking below your pan if the coil is red hot or not. It then waits till the coil completely cools down before it decides to come on again. I find this completely unusable if you're doing anything that requires constant heat. If you're toasting burgers or buns or cooking vegetables, you will find that it takes a phenomenally long time because of this constant switching on and off. Food also cooks unevenly because of this. The only good thing about this is that it is light and compact. If you're heating only water or boiling soup, maybe it might be ok, but otherwise I can't recommend this product to anyone.</review>

<review id="5013">I purchased this to replace a 5 yr old Linksys router after upgrading to a new Verizon DSL modem. Let's just say the wireless part of this router works great, but I could never get it to work with the new modem or the old modem.

My only good experience with this router is when I returned it to Best Buy.</review>

<review id="5017">This product prompts to set the date and time every time it starts, and never saves them.  If you set the time, the computer freezes and won't boot.  If you ignore setting the time, the system boots but is set to January 1, 2000.  If you then change the date and time, it reverts to non-set upon a reboot.  It also shows a fatal error message briefly while booting.  My theory is that whatever battery backs up the time in the bios is missing or not working.  Hence the thing is kind of useless.  It seems like quality control is a real issue on this baby.I bought this from Tiger through Amazon.  I want to return it and get a refund.  It seems rather junky to me.</review>

<review id="5018">Today is Day 11 from the day I ordered this product.  Today, the status of the shipment shows that it has finally left the Hazelton, MO post office, the same place the shipment originated.  I realize I took the "free shipping" method to save a few bucks, but in no way did I expect this thing to get put on absolute bottom priority.  What a joke!  The distance between the originating town and the place it is to be delivered is 14 (FOURTEEN) miles!!!!  And yet, it still is in transit.With this much delay, and having been somewhere at the bottom of a stack of boxes marked for the slow boat to China, I am wondering how much damage has occurred.  Guess I'll find out soon.  This was a gift.  Needless to say, if Amazon's "free shipping" means this level of quality, it won't mean anything.  Meaning, if another company offers the same product for the same price or lower, and I have to pay for shipping, I might as well since this "free shipping" can not be trusted.  Get it together Amazon.  Don't make your "free shipping" look like a great deal when you're sticking your customers with unreasonable delays.</review>

<review id="5019">I loved the camera itself--small, light, streamlined. Unfortunately I could not save video clips longer than a few minutes and editing using the flip video software was impossible. It crashed my Macbook and desktop Mac more times than I care to remember. I tried reinstalling the software but never was able to complete the editing process. A colleague has had similar problems with her Mac and the flip video ultra. Since all the reviews have been great, I'm assuming it works better with a PC. An additional  drawback is that it has only a 2X zoom which means you need to be up close to get any kind of decent shot.</review>

<review id="5020">This book is decent I guess but not for this series. If the character names were different in a totally different series and not associated with the characters we grew to enjoy and love then it would be an ok vampire novel. Though the reason I gave 2 stars is because this is not what I had in mind as the other 3 novels sucked me in and motivated me to buy this 4th book. If i knew from the start of the series that this was the plotted story line I dont think I would have conected to the characters in the same way and would not have been as disappointed to see the utter discrace Bella became. Towards the end of the 3rd book I started getting sick of her, she is so useless I could no longer see what everyone else that was in love with her saw. We never learn anything about her outside of her love for Edward and she never does anything interesting besides feel self pity and make everyone around her try and boast her confidence. Then this book, omg, she is a disaster. I don't even know who she is anymore, does she really love Edward? If she did, she would try and be alittle more upbeat, at least for the wedding. She is marring her soul mate and she doesnt seem the least bit happy. Poor Edward. She says she does the things she does to make everyone else happy and they seem to think that as well but its like a drug addict and their family supporting their habit. They want the addict to quit drugs but the addict says its not their business they can do what they want and what they think is right while the family just sits there and watches the person they love kill themselves. They blame themselves of course and only try and remember the way they used to be to handle being around that person in hopes they will ever return to the person they were. Thats not being a martyer as Jacob says. Thats not self sacrifice, thats selfishness only doing what you want and not making a compromise for what would be the best outcome for everyone.All the characters in this novel have completely changed and I agree over time things would be different but honeslty Bella and Edward have only been together for not even 2 yrs. Not much changes as a teen in the 17-19 age range until you get out on your own and see the world. She has no interests or passions in her life besides Edward and self pity and she needs to at least have a favorite song or dreams to travel the world someday, something like all humans do. She is dead inside, how does everyone want that. At least in the other novels she had somewhat of a sense of humor and wity sarcasim. Here she is just a mental mess of a girl. It makes me sad.</review>

<review id="5021">I bought this hand-held mixer December 2005 and by the January 2007 it had stopped working. Mind you I only use it once every 6 months or so. Therefore, I maybe got at most about 5 uses out of it before it would only go from power level 1 and then back to 0. It would just fluctuate between the off and 1 no matter how much it was pushed. So it was totally useless. Since the warranty is only one year I have spent $54.88 for absolutely nothing.When I called KitchenAid, their service rep said he could do nothing but sell me another one at a cheaper price. Thank you, but "no thank you".</review>

<review id="5022">As of 1/24/08, there is a bug in the 2007 Turbotax software that was going to add over $3,000 to my federal tax bill.  I called the Turbotax "Help" line and spent over two hours on the phone with first and second tier tech support folks helping them reproduce the error. Even when they could see the error, they insisted I was doing something wrong.  I spent long periods on hold waiting while they huddled.  During these "hold" periods, the rep would come back on the line periodically asking if I was still there, and then put me on hold again (I think she hoped I would give up). Eventually a second-tier tech support guy acknowledged that there was a previously unknown bug in the software.  He said he would escalate the matter to the Turbotax programmers.  I asked when the problem would be fixed. Unknown.  I asked to be notified either by e-mail or phone when the patch would be available. They don't do that. I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was put back on interminable "hold" and finally gave up.It seems to me that customers who take the time and trouble to report a product defect, and then actually assist tech support in reproducing the problem, should at least expect a "thank you" for helping the company improve it's product.  Instead, the Turbotax people throw up a wall of almost unrelenting skepticism that wastes everyone's time, and then refuse to extend the common courtesy of giving the customer a timeline or notification for resolving the issue.  I've used Turbotax for many years, but this experience, along with a known tendency for Turbotax to include "penalties" that the IRS would never impose, would make me reluctant to use it again.For Turbotax users: This bug occurs if you did a "rollover" from a 401K to a Traditional IRA and then "converted" and "recharacterized" between your Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA.  Under these circumstances, Turbotax will add the "rollover" amount to your MAGI which may then exceed the income limit for Roth conversion.  Hopefully the bug will be fixed by the time you read this.</review>

<review id="5023">We purchased this breadmaker on November 29, 2007. The only complaint that I had was that I had to struggle to remove the pan,  and  would have assigned it a four star rating for that reason.  That was last week. We lost the paddle and phoned Salton to order a replacement.  We were  informed that the part was no longer available, but they would replace the entire machine as long we could provide proof of purchase dated within the one year warranty period. When we told them we could supply a printout of our Amazon invoice, they informed us that Amazon was not an authorized dealer and therefore they would not replace our machine.First of all, replacing and shipping a large machine when only a small part is required is costly and wasteful. What happened to recycle and reduce?? I think it is unscrupulous that this company continues to sell this product without providing replacement parts.  They also seem to have some problems honoring their warranty.  I certainly cannot recommend buying this machine. Please, if anyone can assist us in locating a replacement paddle, we would be most appreciative.</review>

<review id="5030">I bought this from Amazon and it has 1 week of use now.Yerterday i see the screen has a problema. The plastic frame border on the bottom of the screen is detaching off. You can even see the glue they used to put the plastic frame on top of the screen. I noticed this happens because it get real hot in that part. Its exactly on the botton where the "acer" name is. Its the hottest part of this laptop. Its strange that since most laptops get hot on the bottom where batteries are. Well on that part is so hot that the glue melted and the plastic now leaves an open space between the LCD screen and the frame. Im really pissed off, this laptop has 1 week and this should not happen. I have used it allot, but always plugged into my desk. This should not happen after 7 days of use. Even a basic quality test should have detected this. And im with air conditioner in the office all the time so i cannot imagine how it would look if not. The whole plastic frame would melt. I know it will eventually melt the whole glue and it will come off. Luck it has 4 screws on each border so that will hold the glass on place. I cannot give this back since im outside the US and it costed me 100$ shipping. It has 1 year warranty but I would have to pay 100$ to ship it back and then again 100$ to receive the new one. So thats half of the cost of this laptop. I knew this was cheap and now you all know why. This will happen with all laptops of this model i suppose since when im mean that it gets hot there it really does, so that melts the glue which they used to put it together. I have an Acer 17 LCD which works excellent after 4 years of use, that why i went with Acer again. The screen on this laptop os beatifull, and it has tons or Ram that why i give it a 2 star. I dont thing its acceptable that this happened after 1 week, even when its only the plastic frame on the screen which should not affect the laptop dirt will get into that place and then i can trow this away. Nice 650$. Im sure this will not last me 1 year since if after 7 days this happens i dont give this laptop to much to live. Now you know why its so cheap, because its cheap build. Im sorry for Acer since i will never buy a product from them again. Next time I will go with my feelings and buy a Sony or HP. This was suppose to for work and I use computers for 10 hours straight a day so im sorry that i did not went with something of more quality.</review>

<review id="5032">I bought this for the faster 54Mb rate...it is fast. BUT a few problems or differences in expectations were encountered...I have used D-link, linksys, netgear, cisco, USR and belkin wireless  products. The transmit strength on this compact WGR614 is pretty strong. maybe it's a factor of the 802.11G...it seemed to be as strong as the cisco gear which is phenomenal in itself. The wireless card from netgear for 54G is pretty strong also. I think belkin was the worst, followed up by USRobotics which was also pretty weak, then linksys, then d-link.Connection was extremely easy. I just unplugged the D-link wireless and put in the Netgear. It found the internet automatically, configured itself for access and spoofed the mac address automatically. Something that is great for newbies.MAJOR PROBLEM: I use my cable (comcast-which blows chow most of the time...) to access internet to use stock trading software and as such, is a streaming data stream through a VPN. This router claims VPN pass through...but unless you know which ports to open up..it makes it somewhat difficult to use &quot;real&quot; VPN because all you're doing is opening raw ports to the internet to IP addresses behind the router. This is a pretty big security concern IMO. I just moved all my data from the trading computer to another server that doesn't have ports open...but a pain nonetheless...anyhow, back to the main problem. This netgear router tends to just stop routing...no joke. the connection lights with the internet remain ok, but the router just freezes, stops working and then works again in a few minutes...I've contacted tech support but the Netgear technical support is a complete joke. You wait on hold for 30 minutes (an eternity it felt like) EACH time and then get connected with India..yes, they outsource, and some of the tech folks in India speak faster english with major accents than some spitfire hispanics speaking spanish...needless to say, I had to remind them to slow down and enunciate so I could hear what they were saying..Bottom line, tech support is a joke, if you have a problem. you're on your own...Ive upgraded the firmware TWICE now, even to the new unsupported &quot;beta&quot; to try and stop this freezing...to no avail. I've gone back to my old D-link and it works wonders...go figure...I'm going to order one more netgear router and if that freezes too..then i think there is a hardware/firmware issue...i'm jinxed folks :-)</review>

<review id="5033">This fancy-pants coffee maker was a big disappointment. I bought this for my husband for his birthday - looking for a great pod coffee system. This coffee maker isn't it.He was excited to unwrap his gift - seeing as how we spotted this machine in Bloomingdales. We loved the appearance...but the love stopped there. Sure, it's fast & easy to set-up, BUT...the coffee quality is poor, no better than instant coffee. And on the "travel mug" setting, it only fills the mug about 2/3 full. We tried to brew the same K-cup twice to get it to fill the mug, but that only made the coffee taste like hot water. Our plain Mr. Coffee coffee maker brews better tasting coffee, and fills our mug - no matter what the size. I guess if it means cleaning out the filter everyday, it's worth it for better tasting coffee. Save your money.</review>

<review id="5034">Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)      I was looking forward to trying MS Outlook 2007 with Business Contact Manager but after a few days of playing around with it, I am thoroughly disappointed and frustrated. But first things first.Before upgrading to OL 2007 I ran MS Office 2003. After the upgrade, everything else continued to be 2003 with the exception of Outlook of course. Installation was tedious and took a long time, but that's nothing new with Microsoft products these days - going through that process is like attempting to own Fort Knox! However, once installed, I was pleasantly surprised and really appreciated the improved functionality of the ribbon with all the functions that before were somewhat hidden in conventional drop-down menus. I also really like the new To-Do Bar that can be expanded and collapsed and another of my favorite things is the new and improved color coding by category and flag. So far so good.Just as I began to enjoy the new OL 2007, I had to realize that with this stand-alone product the devil is in the detail:My biggest aggravation is that Outlook 2007 as a stand-alone version has limited functionality. After searching the internet high and low for why all of a sudden my spell checker did not work anymore (I frequently switch between two languages when writing emails and very much depend on this), I finally found a White Paper MS published with a neat list of what all does not work in Outlook 2007 when Word 2007 is not installed. They call the chapter "Experience without Word 2007 installed". Amongst the functions not available are: - No auto-formatting for bullets and numbers; - No support for inserting and working with tables- No background spell-checking- No Thesaurus- No grammar checker- No auto-text (so where before, my name auto-completed when typing it, it now does not anymore)Wow! A product that they sell for well over one hundred dollars works significantly worse than the older version I had previously installed! In order to get the full functionality, I am now forced to upgrade my entire Office 2003 to the 2007 version - at least another $120, depending on what version of Office I need. Or attempt to uninstall OL 2007 and go back to OL 2003... This quite upsets me, I must say.Other things that I noticed: - Sending and receiving email frequently does not work; out of the blue I get send/receive errors. The thing to do then is to go into the Accounts function and use the new "Repair..." button. So far I had to use this three times in about the same amount of days. Apparently in this version, there was indeed a great need for a Repair function that before was not present...- Another weird behavior: Frequently, the program seems to independently change which email account it uses for sending, even when replying. For example, when I receive an email at my default account, then hit Reply, all of a sudden this mail is then being sent from another account. Very, very strange. - And lastly a minor observation: The program seems slightly slower, not too much but noticeable on occasion.As to the Business Contact Manager, I must admit I have not gotten around to trying it - I was far too busy with all the things mentioned above and will probably uninstall Outlook 2007 soon. In summary in my opinion, this whole thing is an aggravating marketing gimmick by Microsoft - sell Outlook 2007 as stand-alone, but basically force the user to upgrade to Office 2007 if he/she wants functionality that was previously available in Outlook 2003. Bad, really, really bad.</review>

<review id="5035">As mentioned the left analog stick is horribly defective. It will send input when centered, not send input when moved, lose it's calibration, whatever you want to call it, but in short, you lose all control of your game. Probably the right stick does it too, but I don't use it for movement so I wouldn't notice.I returned mine 3 times, so I tested 4 controllers. ALL were defective in the exact same way. My old faithful Wingman Rumblepad works flawlessly.I have been waiting now for 3 weeks on an RMA replacement from Logitech. They claim &quot;The product is out of stock, and will be shipped as soon as possible&quot;. So, in 3 weeks Logitech themselves are unable to obtain their own gamepads? I suspect they are waiting for a new version with the defects remedied.IF...IF they fix the analog sticks, this would be an excellent gamepad. IF! At this point though, how would a new customer know which one they were getting, the new non-defective version (if it exists), or the same old defective ones from a stockpile in some warehouse?</review>

<review id="5037">I upgraded to 2008 from an Ancient version of Word on my dual-G5 2Ghz.  I have SP1.I have a simple six column spreadsheet of data I've been maintaining for years now with 750 lines of data.  I cut-n-paste the final line to the next line, modify the data, change the source for a graph, and I'm done with the day's data collection.  On the Old Version, loading the spreadsheet took about a second, copying and pasting was instantaneous, and adjusting the data source took maybe one to two seconds.On this new version, loading takes five seconds, Copying a row takes 75 SECONDS, Pasting 5 seconds, and 15 seconds to adjust the graph data source.Worst upgrade ever.   I'm going back to 2004.</review>

<review id="5038">What a CON job!  I've used Quickbooks for 9 years, switched to Mac, and bought this without READING THE FINE PRINT.  Oh, yeah, it there as it talks about what the program will do, only it's at the bottom of the list.  YOU CANNOT MAKE A PAYROLL CHECK FROM YOUR COMPUTER BUT HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR A $24 MONTH FEE TO AN ONLINE SERVICE!  I know this is unbelievable, but for a small business, it makes no business sense.  This Intuit program therefore fits into the category of a con job.  Nothing but a con job.  What company can use a program that doesn't allow you to make a payroll...for a not so small fee, of course!Jim</review>

<review id="5040">The animation is fantastic. Wall-e does communcate incredibly well non-verbally. The robot looks like a mechanical version of ET. However, I found the robot speech patterns annoying. The politically correct message of the movie is silly and overbearing. The love story between two robots is silly on so many levels. The word "Wall-e" is repeated so often it is irritating. In summary, if the annoying stuff doesn't bother you, you will probably love the movie. Technically, it is very well done.</review>

<review id="5041">I had a Drinkwell fountain for awhile, for my two cats at home.  I also have two cats at work and decided to bring the Drinkwell in for them and I got one of these Fresh Flow fountains for home.  I switched at home because I thought the Drinkwell was a pain to clean.  The first time I changed out the Fresh Flow I was wishing I had just gotten another Drinkwell.  The two main components of the Fresh Flow are easier to clean than the Drinkwell but the benefits stop there.  The reservoir is very small and impossible to clean.  The water in the bowl gets full of crud the very first day and it all just sits in the bottom (Fur, bits of food, dirt from one cat's paw who likes to dip his paw into the bowl).  It needs to be cleaned constantly.  The bowl part is too shallow and the water doesn't seem to move out of the reservoir correctly, and the water level in the bowl gets too low and the pump makes sucking noises.  The pump itself gets coated in slimy goo.My cats also prefer the actual waterfall the Drinkwell provides.  I've never seen them lap water from the plastic slide in the Fresh Flow.  I gave it to a friend and bought another Drinkwell for home.  Drinkwell filters are cheaper and easier to find, so even though it's more expensive initially it turns out to be the better deal.</review>

<review id="5042">I am a huge fan of the Twilight series but this book was a real disappointment. I didn't mind the lack of action; in fact, I liked that she focused on the relationship of Bella and Edward more. I also liked that Bella does start to realize the magnitude of becoming a vamp. You get some more background stories on the rest of the Cullens too, and on the werewolves. Now the bad... Bella does get really annoying in this book. Are we really just supposed to swallow that after all the professing of her intense love for Edward that she could ever possibly feel the same (or close) for Jacob? And I felt that both Jacob and Edward's characters were out of whack in this one. I ended up hating Jacob for being so pushy and mad at Edward for being so nice and understanding. But if you love the series like I do you have to read this one too. The irritating stuff doesn't really happen until near the end anyway!</review>

This year it's wasted more of my time than if I'd done my own taxes by hand!!The State of Indiana software doesn't include a question to input non-resident out-of-state income tax credits (for non-reciprocal states like California).  I called and spend 2 hours on hold and talking to a rep. to convince him of this fact.  He finally agreed that my CD was faulty and sent me a new one. I received the new CD a week later, uninstalled my old one, and reinstalled the new one.  And guess what, it had EXACTLY the same problem!!  After wasting another hour on the phone, I asked for a refund (and remarkably, got it).

<review id="5047">Do NOT purchase this router.  I have been a happy Netgear customer in the past, and am technical enough to keep both home and small office wireless networks running fine, but this model has a hardware problem that Netgear tech support has finally acknowledged, but for which they are not providing an adequate fix.  As others have mentioned, the router will often drop connectivity, and rebooting is the only solution.  I bought one, had these problems start (luckily within the 90 day tech support window), and returned the router to Netgear (at my expense) in exchange for another one, which demonstrated the SAME problem less than 24 hours after installation.  After yet another long call to India the latest tech support rep acknowledged that lots of these models are having the same problem, and upgrading to the latest firmware (which I did immediately upon installing both of these routers) won't fix it, so her solution was... send this one back (AGAIN at my expense) and they would send me yet another one of the SAME model, which she (for no defensible reason) assures me will work.  For more background please see the Netgear tech support forums, where you will see scores of people experiencing the same problem and the same non-solution from Netgear.  Save yourself the trouble and buy a different wireless router.</review>

No problem, read the instructions and there is a screw to adjust for this.  Which, unfortunately, did nothing.  Not higher, not lower, nada.  OK, so I read the manual about returns.  They say they'll replace it and pay for shipping.  If they do that, I'll be reasonably pleased.  But y'know what really ticked me off?  In discussing bad machines, they use the phrase "failed" mixer.  In quotes.  Like it's not really broken, the customer is just an idiot.  Like I can't tell whether it's working or not.  Like I can't read the instructions and make the adjustment as indicted.  I am not an idiot and I don't appreciate being insulted.  Wish I hadn't bought this thing.</review>

<review id="5063">I was so excited for this book and I kept waiting and waiting for it to get better or for it to pick up, that never happened. It feels like Meyer took the easy way out on this and rushed the book to end when the iron was still hot. The first three were great books I was not disappointed, however this one falls so very flat. The things that annoyed me most was Jacob and Charlie's fates. And even Bella's I understand that she comes into her own but it's so rushed and she has all this power and it feels like Meyer understood that so many fans loved Jacob that to keep him around she threw in that crazy love for him just to keep him in Bella's life. Overall maybe this should have been a first draft not the ones fans deserve. Not to compare but Harry Potter took eleven years and it was worth the wait and people were still interested years after the first, maybe a little while longer would have helped this book.</review>

<review id="5064">The TaxCut does not properly handle Stock Options:For example, for incentive stock options all its interview screens do is to generate a general message on ISO stock option tax treatment. It assumes that your employer included the compensation income generated by the exercise in W-2 (which might not be true). If you exercised options, got stock certificates, and then sold those the same year with loss, there is no way correct (decrease) the reported compensation income. It also does not help you to properly compute capital gain / loss from the sale.For employee stock purchase plan it also does not perform any computation. I hate to do it, but I will have to switch to TurboTax - last year they did computations properly. This year they raised their prices and I thought to try TaxCut, but this was a mistake. The only consolation is that both troweprice.com and scottrade.com have 35% off TurboTax cupones.</review>

<review id="5067">The movie line is lame for something tht is supposed to be futuristic.  Its a cheap knock off of the original and not worth the money it cost to buy this second season, which, BTW, is only 10 segments.  If I had not seen the original, I might have liked this one better than I did.  I certainly would have liked it better if I would have received the entire 2nd season that I paid for.  The more I think about it, the worse this film gets.  Save your money and buy a real SiFi movie.  Instead of the entire second season, the makers stopped after 10 shows and packaged it.  There are previews of movies to come so I can only guess as to the reasons the producers sent ten shows instead of the usual 22 to 36 that come with a series.  I probably would have given it a higher rating if I had something to watch to base a higher rating on.  The story line lost a lot in the conversion from the "real" Galactia to this chopped version.  If I could do it all over again, I would have gone with another series and left the new Galactia to rot in the storage rooms of Amazon.</review>

<review id="5074">TurboTax, as in the past, does a very good job of helping one in the preparation of the current (2007) Federal and State Tax Returns. However, Intuit needs to consider including free efile in most TurboTax versions. This year, most TurboTax versions add a $17.95 fee per return efiled. Most folks don't catch this sneaky trick until the Tax Return(s) are nearly finished. The back of the package mentions the added fee in very small print. Intuit should be able to add the efile feature for Federal and one State free of any additional charge by increasing the retail price of applicable products by $5.00 to $8.00.

<review id="5081">Here are my two bits on Quickbooks 2009 after upgrading from QB Simple Start 2006:I think the fact that there is a review here where Intuit, through respondeat superior, admits their product doesn't work says it all.Intuit's marketing and development team has successfully turned QB 2009 into the software equivalent of a "pimpmobile". It comes with a chandelier hanging in the back seat, "superfly headlights", "lake pipes", and shag carpet headliner. Some people might like this, but I'd prefer the ability to opt out of the pimpmobile package.There is no option for installing a "light" or "offline" version that does not include all of Intuit's superfluous services, registry entries, malware-like background activities, and other push-marketing schemes.It is painfully slow and a massive system resource hog, more so than QB 2006...much to my amazement.So, if you want accounting software that gets you from point A to point B quickly, efficiently, and reliably, Quickbooks 2009 is most definitely NOT the product to purchase.  It is .NET garbage that will violate your PC like nothing you've ever seen before.This is the last year my company will be using Intuit's products.  QB 2006 was borderline, but tolerable because it integrated so well with Turbotax.  Since Intuit owns Turbotax, I guess the marketing cons thought it would be a great revenue builder to make Turbotax 2008 incompatible with QB 2006.  So we had to upgrade to QB 2009.  So, Intuit now puts out poorly coded software, AND cons their customers into effectively buying two-year licenses instead of software packages through questionable business practices.Ah, and before I forget:  You are REQUIRED to call to register.  They outsource their customer service to some far away land (India) where everyone has very generic names, reads from canned scripts, and speaks broken English.  So get ready for long hold times, frustration, and having your business' private information distributed to far away lands that are outside of your jurisdiction.I highly recommend new business owners to seek out alternatives, 'cause once the SOBs at Intuit have you on the hook...your all in.It's almost as if they are trying to torpedo their own revenue stream by conning their existing customers, overdeveloping software, and requiring their customers to learn Hindi in order to obtain customer support.  Fascinating that a company can be so mismanaged as to lose captive customers...glad I don't own any of their stock.</review>

<review id="5085">This router was not the latest version.  It would not work with XP.</review>

<review id="5086">The version A of this router is not stable.  If your network streams too much, the router can suddenly drop connection and lose its firmware.  How can you configure the router without firmware in it or with damaged firmware?  If you connect to your router and it said connection is limited or restricted, and you are not able to get in router's configuration page usually at 192.168.0.1 , which means your firmware is lost or damaged.  There is a secret way that you have to spend almost one hour talking to their technical support in India to get.  This issue happened to me twice, and I am tired of calling them deal with the same stupid problem.  D-Link should come out better way to solve this problem instead of loading same program for non-firmware hardware.  Router should NOT lose firmware itself.  However, simply the best way to do with this today is the following.Reload firmware to DIR-615 when firmware is lost1.  push reset button for 10 to 15 seconds, when power is on. 2.  Go to property of network connection, configure internet protocol.    set ip address to 192.168.0.99 and submast 255.255.0.0 3.  push reset button for 10 seconds when power is off, and 20 seconds when power is on. 4.

<review id="5087">Like other reviewers, my son also had a terrible rash after we switched from Swaddlers to Cruisers.  Our pediatrician had no idea what it was and prescribed an anti-fungal ointment and a hydrocortisone lotion.  After more than a week using both, the rash just continued to get worse.  We bought a package of Pampers Baby Dry just to see if a different diaper helped, and the rash cleared up within two days.  I didn't really believe that it was the Cruisers diapers causing the rash since the Swaddlers and Baby Dry were fine (all Pampers brand), but when we tried using the Cruisers on him again a few weeks later (we had a ton left over) the rash came back after just a day.  I did a quick search online and found lots of people have this problem.  If you use these diapers, watch carefully for a rash and change to a different line of diapers right away if you see it and save your baby the pain and discomfort!</review>

<review id="5088">This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      I got this movie based on the tremendously positive reviews it got.  From the previews the movie theaters showed, it looked like the most ridiculously stupid movie one could ever see. Because of the reviews, I figured I was wrong, so I forced my family to see it.  Surely it MUST be good, if so many other people loved it.  Someone even said it topped Toy Story. Sorry, but i didn't even come close to being as good, let alone topping it.  My whole family thought it was boring and would never want to see it again.  My kids range in age from 12 to 22.  My husband fell asleep, so it's not great for adults, contrary to reviews. We kept waiting for the movie to get better, but it never did.  There were a few scenes that were kind of cute and led you to believe it might get better, but it was one big let down. Not worth seeing.</review>

<review id="5089">What can I say.  I admire Meyer's writing style, how she delves into a character and transforms something on the page to someone you could actually believe is real.  I absolutely adored the first three books and I read them over and over again until the fourth installment of the book came out.  I admit I'm a little old to be reading young adult books (I'm 28) but I fell in love with the characters and the story, but to see it end like this.  I know Meyer is a good author even her book "The Host" had me staying up until the wee hours of the night, it was so good.  Breaking Dawn broke the illusion.  I've read a lot of books and believe it or not I've read this same plot in not so well written horror novels.  A girl gets pregnant and has a half-vampire half-human child, it's not right and it's not believable.  Forget the fact that Bella has character flaws that's normal and human.  Come on guys you know there are girls that center their universe around men or love.  I didn't care about that because I still found Bella likeable even thou I'm in no way agree about her point of view.  I think this book could have been so much better without throwing  a child in the mix.  There still could have been a showdown with the Volturi without a kid being in there.  I feel like Meyer just wanted an excuse to throw in all these other vampires in the mix so she can write about them later on.  I'm happy that Bella received her happy ending but not with the circumstances that led to that happiness.  The previous reviews are right life does not end with everyone holding hands and singing.  I know this is fantasy so happy endings happen more in books than in real life but in this book it's completely off centered.  Jacob imprinting on Bella's daughter I'm sorry to say was extremely creepy I found myself getting sick even thou I understood the dynamics of it I still could not cope.  The whole book made human love seem trivial, like it's nothing compared to imprinting or vampire love.  I believed in Jacob's love for Bella, believed it was strong and enduring.  I think I would have been more accepting of him imprinting on someone else.  Meyer draws the conclusion in her book that the fates kept Jacob in Bella's life in order for him to find his true mate in Edward and Bella's offspring. Uhhh, What?</review>

Both have the analog stick calibration drift problem, which is widespread and well-documented online (check out the logitech web site user forums). Unfortunately, Logitech is totally ignoring the problem despite a tremendous amount of complaints (presumably because it is a unpatchable hardware problem). I am also upset with EA for endorsing it for MVP Baseball 2004. I replaced it with the comparable Saitek P880, which has worked well for me so far.</review>

<review id="5098">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      My son gave me this to watch, he should have saved his money.  I had to speed it up to get through it, and it kept on running long after I hoped it was ending, people died and came back to life, a dozen bad guys, back and forth, words , words and more words.  Superman 1 and 2 just got bigger in my book, no other comic movie has come close, Wake up hollywood, hype money is ruining movies, let alone good and bad actors taking parts in movies that are trash.</review>

<review id="5099">I'm extremely disgusted with this product - not because it's bad but because of the horrendous service from D-link. I bought the DNS-323 yesterday because I desperately need to backup some data and my drives are full. So. . . I installed the software - it was a bit of a pain because it didn't install fully the first time. The second time worked like a charm. HOWEVER, in order to get it to work, I had to call tech support (which appears to be in India - ugh) and they were just about useless. Not only that but I've been trying to download both the firmware and software updates but can't because D-link's FTP servers have been down! That's right, DOWN! Tech support keeps telling me, "try again in an hour" (sorry, but I'm tired of doing that), I e-mailed tech support too about the problem. Their response was that their support site is up (I didn't ask if their support site was up, I told them that their FTP server was DOWN and that I needed the updates). Tech support also lied to me last night and told me that they would e-mail the updates to me within the hour (that was almost 24 hours ago). It's rather disgusting, to say the least, that you buy a product that is supposed to allow you to back up your data and also includes an FTP server and yet the manufacturer can't keep their own FTP server going. Oh, one last thing. The last tech support person told me that D-links FTP server has been down for the past THREE days!</review>

<review id="5101">Breaking Dawn is probably one of the most boring and predictable books I've ever read.The whole time I felt as though I was reading some kind of fan fiction. The only plot twist I didn't expect was Jacob imprinting on Nessie, and in a way that really ruined it for me.The major problem with this book is everyone gets a happy ending. I'm aware it's fantasy, but this is sickening. The whole birth of Nessie even violated the rule that Meyer created in the first book. This is equally sickening.The whole teenage pregnancy and marriage is a bad message, but it didn't really bother me. Her parents reactions were unrealistic, but the rest of the town acted as anyone would. I'm not going to say it doesn't send a bad message to young girls in love, but that isn't an excuse for crap that goes on these days.Just read the Wikipedia article for this one guys. The 754 pages aren't worth it.</review>

<review id="5102">Okay... So I loved the first three books in the Twilight Saga, but breaking dawn? No!!*Spoilers*A BABY?! What? Bella doesn't WANT a kid. And then she turns around and decides that she loves it and HAS to keep it. And Edward DOESN'T want to keep it or even feel any kind of feeling towards it. WHAT?! That's not Bella or Edward -ish. The entire time I read this I felt like I was reading fanfiction. I kept thinking, "Nope. The real Bella would freak out. The real Edward would feel remorse for killing their child." And then part two came on and it was from JACOB'S point of view. I was pissed. I liked the charaterization of Edward but then you didn't get to see what Bella thought or what they said in private. And I honestly hated Bella in this part. She was so selfish!!! She had to on the couch where no one could hang around without being around her. And even though she chose Edward and knows that it hurts him, she still gets all happy when he walks in. I did like the Jacob-Leah relationship. It was more realistic. And I liked the scene where the baby is born. It was high anxiety and actually sucked me in. And... I hate to say this... But after Bella died... I kind of.... Wanted her to STAY DEAD. Because then Jacob imprinted ON THE BABY. Which didn't weird me out because it was a baby but because it was BELLA'S baby. The woman he is supposed to love!!!!!! And at that present moment he thought Bella was dead! Not okay. And p.s. I hate Rosalie. She's a two-faced whore. Bleh.And then Bella was changed. I liked that part too. I liked her point of view of the changing and her waking up. But... she was too perfect. She woke up and wasn't really all that thirsty. Which I sort of expected, she didn't like blood as a human and she was prepared when she was changed. But I kind of wanted her blood thirsty and wild and forced to live in Alaska with only Edward. OH MY GOD. I KNOW WHAT REALLY MADE ME MAD. This book didn't follow the others in that Edward didn't protect Bella. She woke up and didn't need him to keep her from killing humans. He didn't have to protect her from him. He didn't have to really even protect her from the Volturi because a bunch of other people were there to help. He never looked or acted like he was freaking out over her after she turned into a vampire. He just... let it go. That was it. That's what was so un-Edward.It was like Edward freaked out (the "burning man") when Bella was pregnant but then when he was changing her he was just determined and then she was changed and he just loved her. As in he didn't fear for her.Back to the story. So Bella isn't really thirsty and she only really freaks out once at anyone (Jacob) and it isn't really all that big of a deal. And then perfectly-perfect, Bella and Edward get the most perfect little house of their own where they can live perfectly together and they love each other perfectly and their family is perfect. And then Charlie goes along with Bella's new life perfectly. And their slight worry is the kid and how fast she's growing (which ends up not being a problem) and Bella visiting the Volturi, who can't pick her mind to find out about the baby. No worries. I don't even want to talk about the rest of the book except to say that the ending was predictable. Of course Alice and Jasper would come back. Of course the ending would be perfect with no one dying and Bella's gift being the thing that saves the day. Of course. Like we couldn't predict that.I think that Stephenie Meyer was projecting her love of being a mother onto her writing. And I don't like it because this is Bella's story, not Stephenie Meyer's autobiography.</review>

<review id="5103">This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)      The cast seamed fabulous. The trailer was funny. I had great expectations then the movie started. Bad taste, not funny jokes. I zapped it because I got bored of this non-sense.The two strong points are: Ben Stiller's fabulous biceps and Robert Downey Jr's acting. The rest is just not good. I honestly don't see what people who gave it good ratings found in that movie but maybe I just don't get the Hollywood's inside satirical critic?I wish I could give it a zero star!</review>

<review id="5104">I have been a TT customer for over 7 years.  I found their programing easy to use when I didn't have much experience in the tax field or computers.

<review id="5105">I can't exactly say that I hated this book. If it had been written as a part of a different series or somehow as a stand alone book, I may have really enjoyed it. However, very little about this book felt like the proper ending for the Twilight Saga.  For most of this book I honestly felt as though I were reading a piece of fanfiction...not exactly bad fanfiction, but fanfiction none the less.  Everyone seemed so out of character.  Nothing really flowed with the other books.  :Spolier Ahead:I had no expectations on what this book would hold.  I had only started reading the series about 2 weeks before the release of this book, and I am not the sort of person to sit around and imagine different endings.  I WANTED a happily ever after for this book, but I was prepared for it not to be.  I was ready for there to have been some kind of pain in the end, but when I got the happily ever after it felt somehow wrong.  Everything was too perfect, too easy.  There was this big build up for Bella to have to make a sacrifice of some kind, but she didn't have to.  She got everything she ever wanted, dreamed of, and more. Normally this would make me happy.  This is how I like books to end, but somehow I didn't like the way she got there.</review>

<review id="5111">I would not recommend buying this no matter how tech-challenged or skilled you are. Too bad this site doesn't allow a no star rating because that's what this deserves.I purchased this as a gift for a technologically challenged friend as it seemed very simple to use, and in reality it probably should be, but isn't. The "zoom" feature is very difficult to use, its actually much easier to just move closer. The control button is small and does four things, or at least is intended to. Pushing the top zooms in and the bottom zooms out but more often it does absolutely nothing and your picture gets shakey from struggling with it. The volume adjustment uses the same button and is also very difficult to adjust and makes recording and playback a true hassle.We were not able to download and install the necessary software from the camcorder to his computer running Windows XP. We tried multiple times, restarted the computer and tried again and were still unable to install the software. You can not view the videos without this specific software. The clips play as windows media sound files but not video. The website offers no alternative way to download the software and the FAQ section is useless. So what's the bottom line? This is a camcorder that does not zoom in or out easily or efficiently. The sound adjustment is useless. You can't get your video clips out of the camcorder and view them because the software won't install. There is no tech support. Still thinking about purchasing this?  Really???</review>

<review id="5112">I was sold on Gwyneth's testimonial and even saw a video of her working out with Tracy. The exercise video - huge huge disappointment. I'm going to echo some of the other comments on these reviews but it needs to be stated. Tracy doesn't conduct this video like an exercise video, it seems to be more like she's performing or dancing around on stage. Her moves are hard to follow and she tries to maintain this sex kittenish thing that I both find annoying and embarrassing. Her abs part doesn't seem to work the abs at all and she throws in this hip wiggle thing at the end that seems to be a way to show off her hip bones (I'm really not understanding how that move has anything to do with abs). And her "teeny tiny arms" and "muscular structure" bit - I don't think she knows what she's talking about. I've weight-trained since I was a teenager and have yet to bulk up from living heavy weights. I also thought it was too much for her to expect us to perform the non-weighted arm exercises as well as the 3-lb weighted ones. And I'm not sure about you all: but the only part of my arms that was sore the next day were my shoulders. So much so that I thought I had pulled something. Her movements are not easy to understand - she pulls her leg behind her and twists and contorts in a way that's not easy to follow. I am continuing to do the work out, because I paid $30 for the video. I'll see if it transforms my body into the "teeny tiny" vessel she talks about so glowingly.</review>

<review id="5113">I've only recently entered the Twilight fold.  Having initially read reviews of the series in library journals and having heard passionate testimonials from avid fans, I thought I would give it a try.  Inexorably, I fell absolutely and positively in love with the first three Twilight books.  I read them (the first time, that is) in three days.  Then, like a junkie, I feverishly searched the media for news on the movie, the books, and all things Stephanie Meyers.  Stephenie Meyer's books were my brand of heroin.  So, like millions of other strung out addicts, I lined up until midnight to score the ultimate fix. The final installment was in my hands. I didn't know I was holding a ticking time bomb in my hands.  One which would ultimately implode, destroying the magic spell of Meyer's world and the intense affection I held for its inhabitants. Like many of you, I kept asking myself: "Who actually wrote this book? What happened? This must be a cruel joke...I will wake up tomorrow, and learn that Breaking Dawn is an elaborate hoax perpetrated to discredit Meyer." Meyer has commented on her love of Bronte's Wuthering Heights, Austen's Pride and Prejudice, and Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.  Having read these books dozens of times, I saw glimmers of their bittersweet brilliance in the first three Twilight books.  I cried for Bella as I had cried for Cathy, Elizabeth, and Juliet.And then I read Breaking Dawn. For the first one hundred pages, I was entranced. I couldn't put the book down.  I thought, "Finally, Bella and Edward can consummate their love, against seemingly impossible odds! Finally, the big payoff is here!" Then, the heartbreak began... Remember when Bella's heart cracks in two in Eclipse?  Mine shattered the moment I read the words "little nudger."  When I read the first three books, I felt seventeen again.  The butterflies in my stomach, the blinding tunnel vision, and the intense emotions experienced during that first love washed over me during Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse.  When Jacob left at the end of Eclipse, I cried. The price of true love was justly paid with his departure.  Price...A lot of the reviews I've read here aptly speak of "paying a price."  Intense, obsessive, passionate love--a love of the Wuthering Heights variety, anyway--demands an exacting price. Bella cannot have Jacob and Edward, just as Catherine cannot have both Edgar and her beloved Heathcliffe.  The price of an extraordinary love is an ordinary life. But the price--the sacrifice--makes the purchase more dear, makes it all the sweeter. In Breaking Dawn, what price is paid?  Bella gets Edward.  Bella gets Jacob. Bella gets beauty and grace.  Bella gets a baby. Bella gets a fairytale cottage.  Bella gets all the powerful trappings of vampiric power without all the burden of newborn instincts.  Bella gets to keep her human family.  Bella gets Meyer's "perfect ending." The perfect ending comes at what price?  The price is the love story, the plot, and the character development.  The price is seeing Jacob turn from a noble suitor who knows when to bow out, into a toddler's pet.  The price is seeing the endearingly vulnerable Bella turn into a perfect shell of her former self.  The price is seeing Edward, who was once a continuously smoldering cauldron of desire, degraded to a level of abject affliction. The price is watching Charlie turn from a loving and protective father into a "don't need to know" Homer Simpson.  The price is having to stomach a bloodbath,a mutant birth which rivals the absurdity of the alien reptile baby delivery of the "V" TV miniseries of the 1980's.  (Remember that one, gentle reader?)Bella's surrender of her human life to Edward should have ended intimately with his lips caressing her throat, not with fountains of blood spewing from her mouth as Jacob watches. The price is too steep--much too heartbreaking--for me to pay.My opinion is inconsequential.  It matters to no one but me, but...Not that you asked but...Ms. Meyer, you are a fantastically talented writer.  You have the power to spin a story which transcends the ordinary  and transports teens and housewives alike into a world of sparkling, amorous, and compelling fantasy. You are the real deal.What hast thou wrought?  I know that you, like any writer worth his or her salt, wrote this book for yourself, for your own satisfaction.  You wrote the story of Breaking Dawn for you.  I'm just so heartbroken that it wasn't written for me.</review>

<review id="5114">I returned my Breville 800JEXL Juice Fountain Elite 1000 purchased December 7, 2006 due to severe defective operational and design flaws. Listed below are my unacceptable operational findings:  1. The Breville 800JEXL Juice Fountain Elite 1000 (Juicer) design flaw allows for juice to spurt out from the sides due to a super-high performance motor speed (1000-watt) which does not accommodate the plastic/steel Juicer Cover construction. The Safety Locking Arm is not sufficient to stop the escape of juice from spattering out the side.2. The Juicer's construction does not adequately accommodate the torque momentum. When operating at high speeds, the Juicer will vibrate and move across the counter.3. The Stainless Steel Filter Basket does not sufficiently accommodate the operational environment to ensure large pieces of food are not thrown against the plastic portion of the Juicer Cover and into the Large Pulp Container.  The cutting blade does not properly cut the ends of fruits and vegetables.4. The high-performance motor overpowers the Stainless Steel Filter Micro Mesh Filter Basket in such a manner that a large quantity of juice is expelled as form rather than juice.  The Breville 800JEXL Juice Fountain Elite 1000 does not honor its claim of juicing a variety of fruits and vegetables.  Even at low speed, food with medium to high water content is not properly juiced.I am so sorry that Breville Pty Ltd. chose to release a product that increases transactional costs for stakeholders (customers and distributors) who trusted in their vision.</review>

<review id="5115">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      This movie was f***ing awful.  Another loud, obnoxious Michael Bay crapfest.  It took a promising premise and shrouded it in the most idiotic plot imaginable.  Giant robots fighting each other over a pair of eyeglasses?  Also, matching wits with a chihuahua... and losing?  (Typical dialogue:  "That rodent lubricated on my foot!"  Har, har.)  These robots are just as dorky as their names:  "Optimus Prime" sounds like the name of a steak restaurant, and are the bad robots supposed to be intimidated by "Bumblebee"?  It's loaded with cardboard-cutout characters reciting stock dialogue and tromping through the same old Bay routine plot.  I defy anyone to point to anything in this movie that isn't just a barely disguised recycling of things we saw in "Armageddon" or "Con Air."  Sure, there's lots of well-done action scenes, but couldn't Bay have tried at least A LITTLE to make the whole experience a little less painful and redundant?  Challenge yourself, Michael!</review>

<review id="5116">I bought two EZXS55W units.  One worked for nine months before two ports failed.  I called Linksys to have it replaced and they told me I had to ship the unit to them before I got my replacement.  I talked them into sending a replacment to me first so I could use the same box to return the defective unit.  Then they said they would charge my credit card for the full MSRP until they received the failed unit, plus I had to pay for the shipping back to them.  I refused, talked to a supervisor, and still no joy.  The shipping would cost me almost as much as a new unit.  This feedback is not just about the EZXS55W.  It's about the company in general.  They represent the typical greedy big business with their attitude concerning customer service and their products fail too often.  I had two of their routers fail as well.  No more Cisco/Linksys for me.</review>

<review id="5117">Please note that Black and Decker doens not produce these units any longer despite their name being attached to them.

If the product had some name that I never heard of I would not have purchased it in the first place. DO NOT BUY</review>

<review id="5118">I have never used speech recognition software before. Therefore, I was very excited to try Dragon Naturally Speaking 10, Preferred version. I pre-ordered ($99.95) it a week before release and when I tried to install it on my eMachines T3025 I received several error messages that failed to tell me why the software would not install. After considerable time on hold (long distance telephone calls) I was informed by a very polite and heavily accented "technician" that my processor did not possess the 2EE instructions required by the software. Not to be deterred, I purchased a new Dell desktop computer with a Core 2 Quad processor featuring the 2EE instructions and more. Today, when I attempted to install the software, the installation failed. The error message was that the software does not support 64 bit. Nuance's web pages offered no help that I could find. I dread the thought of additional long distance phone charges for being placed on extended hold; therefore, I'll post this on Amazon with a copy to Nuance. I have high hopes that someone more savvy than I can get me up and running. I'm waiting... :)</review>

<review id="5119">Put simply, this product was so terrible that I threw it out and bought a regular ole battery powered one. I just couldn't get it to cut the hairs.

<review id="5120">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)      This movie is fantastic on all fronts- I've seen it 3 times and can't get enough. Seeing it at the IMAX was one of my most fondest summer memories and still is. I made a vow to buy the movie when it got released......and I did. As much as I love having it on DVD, I was VERY let down by the DVD. The "Sounds of Anarchy" feature was interesting but it was just about the song "Why So Serious?", a suite that's 2 notes and runs 9 minutes long. I didn't want to see about like 5 minutes of a cellist playing 2 notes. The batsuit thingy was interesting but way too short. It's nice to have the IMAX scenes, but can't we watch them WITH the movie???? And the Gotham City newscasts... *snore*. Boring!!!So overall, DO buy the movie if you want the movie on DVD, but choose your poison carefully- get the one disc instead. You'll be happier.</review>

<review id="5121">Anything could be better!!. I live abroad and bought one in USA but it was defective. When I asked PNY for the warranty, they  said I had to pay the shipping costs (international, BTW) to get it fixed, it was about US$34, and when they send it back they didn't made it properly and I had to pay custom fees (US$15). They said they would refund the money back but they didn't.  At the end, I ended paying about US$170 dlls for an 8gb flash memory. Just google it and you will find how many people complain of this product and the customers service of PNY.</review>

<review id="5126">As a device, this is a pretty fantastic (but expensive) time waster.  There are thousands of apps available, and some are even useful!However, as a phone, this is easily the worst cell phone that I have EVER owned.  Calls are dropped constantly.  It usually takes 1 or 2 tries to even make a call.  Ergonomically, the phone doesn't fit at all to your face.  While it is designed to fit well in your pocket, there wasn't any thought put into making it robust for said location.  The headphone and charging jacks quickly become unusable with lint.  There are also issues with lint fouling the 'Home' button.  Unlike the jacks, there is no way to fix this issue (other than buying another overpriced phone).Also, none of your old iPod and iPhone chargers will work with this as well.  Apple really loves to stick it to their customers with a lack of backwards compatability (and I'm a Mac guy....)  Finally, if you don't remember to charge the phone every other day, it will be dead when you actually need to use it.</review>

<review id="5132">I bought one of these several months ago.  It was great for about two weeks, and since then it's been nothing but trouble.To begin with, the filter is essentially worthless.  It has a few small, loosely packed granules of activated charcoal in a big bag made of white fuzzy filter material that doesn't even reliably collect the algae that inevitably form in the thing.  The filters don't last months, as the instructions claim -- more like a week or two until they're hopelessly contaminated with algae and have to be discarded lest they cause the whole bowl to gunk up.Oh, did I mention the algae?  This thing is just full of nooks and crannies that get splashed with water -- but don't stay wet or have continual flow over them -- perfect for breeding the icky green stuff.  It's nearly impossible to clean it well enough to stop the growth once it starts; all you can really do is slow it down enough that -- if you're lucky -- it won't make the water taste bad or (worse) make your pets sick.  In fact, we thought we'd sanitized the entire thing using bleach (no easy feat, and *not* something that should be necessary) only to see the algae regrow twice before we figured out that it was even inside the pump, which we had to disassemble into 3 pieces to clean -- well, clean, more or less.  I'm not going to dump bleach into the pump, it has metal parts.I pin the blame for this one on the crummy filter, first and foremost, and on the product design that creates dark, damp, hard-to-clean surfaces everywhere.  Oh, and did I mention that the filters are hard to find?  Big chain pet stores are happy to sell you this water bowl (I assume they make more margin than on the Drinkwell, which was the original product in this category) but can't be bothered to stock the filters.  There are aquarium filters in similar sizes -- those would actually even do some good, unlike the Petmate filters -- but the cheap pump won't generate enough pressure to give a decent flow rate through them.  Nice.Don't make the mistake I did.  Buy a Drinkwell, not the house-brand knockoff (this product) even if it's on sale.</review>

<review id="5134">After all the hype for this book, it reallyfailed to live up to expectations. I gave the first three books to my mom, and she liked them. Then I gave her this and she had to put it down in the middle. Bella is so helpless, even as a vampire. In the first books, she was helpless, but in a kind of lovable way. When she became a vampire, she lost all of her personality, and everything that made her who she is! There was no character growth in this book. The two climaxes were where she had the baby and when the Volturi attacked, both of which turned out fine, by the way. As morbid as it may seem, I think that the book would have been better if someone important died. And what was with all of the extra vampires, they weren't even important in the end. When I was done with the book, I realized that for the last 150 pages, Stephanie Meyer had tried to drag out the book by hanging onto the weak plot by her fingernails. The ending was very dissapointing also and really failed to wrap up this formerly really great saga.</review>

<review id="5135">(Note: Amazon has deleted certain key info from my review. Since they don't edit comments, read the comment below for the missing info.)After reading through many reviews here, and struggling all day to get this unit running as range extender/repeater, it looks like the negative reviews are mostly from people trying to use it as a repeater. Apparently, if you're just using it as a wireless router, it seems to work fine. In fact, the setup disk and the PDF instructions deal only with that use of the product. If you want to use it to extend the range of your signal, Linksys leaves you without any instruction whatever, despite a blurb on the box stating you can use it as a repeater. Luckily, another reviewer (Pinoy in NJ) was kind enough to detail just how he got the unit to work as a repeater. Definitely start there. A few additional comments:  - If you are on a Mac, the installation disk won't run. If you're trying to set up a repeater, the disk is useless anyway. So are the instructions on the PDF file. - You need to have the unit hooked up via the included CAT5 cable to your existing router, or you won't get anywhere. Once you have "programmed" the unit, you will be able to disconnect it, and place it elsewhere in the house.- After attaching the unit to your router, go into your Internet browser and type "[...]". This calls up the setup menu. The login is blank, the password is Admin, unless you changed it.-Type "[...]" to bring up the setup page for your WRT54G router (unless you have a different router)-From the WRT54G pages, you need to find the MAC address. It's in the tab "Status", third line down on that page. Write this down.-On the WAP54G page, click the Setup tab, then the AP Mode subtab. Select the third option, Repeater. Enter the Mac address from the previous step. -I disabled all security, since I couldn't get it to work. Sorry I can't help you there. It was something of a miracle when the thing worked at all. If someone wants to camp out at the curb with a laptop browsing [...], more power to them!-Make sure both the router and the Access Point are tuned to the same channel. At this point, you should be able to disconnect the cable, and still be able to ping the AP using the [...] address. Try accessing the Internet now using a wireless computer somewhere in the house. Wish I could be more specific, but honestly, I found myself repeating the same actions over and over, and it seemed to work finally for no apparent reason. I list the main points above, as these seem to be key. What I wish Linksys (or someone) would sell is a Repeater. You would plug it in to the power (no cable at all), and it would sense the wireless network. Pop in a setup disk, configure the settings and security, and you're done. It doesn't work that way at all. Instead, Linksys provides a button (it looks like the Cisco logo) that blinks furiously for five minutes, and seems to do nothing but change the SSID. It's SUPPOSED to "automatically" set things up, and maybe it does with a newer version of the router (WRT54G), but not mine. There is lots of opinion about the SSID (do they need to match, should you broadcast the SSID). People report that it changes by itself, which means your connection will drop until you pick the new SSID in your Network Connections. All this just to boost the signal to a room at the end of the hall. Linksys needs to make this a MUCH easier process somehow. If someone like me, an IT person with 20 years experience with computers, struggles for a full day to get it to work, there's a problem. No more Linksys for me!</review>

<review id="5138">Teeth clog easily and often. Using the trimmer guards makes this worse and it doesn't cut hair at all. Each time the guard must be taken off to clear out the teeth, and in addition the guards pop off unexpectedly. You must pass over an area MANY times to get MOST of the hair. This takes a very long time to use with a so-so result. Although the small teeth do not cause large knicks in the skin, they do tend to get caught under flat laying hairs, they then dig into the skin while ripping off large chunk at the same time. This creates a larger and more painful blemish than I have ever experienced with any other product - electric or manual. Blood everywhere. Before this I bought a new Braun 360 with the auto cleaning stand. I waited to use it on other areas than my face until this arrived, because I thought the trimmer specifically marketed to men shaving delicate areas would work better. WRONG, obviously the Braun is in a different class and much more expensive. It also works. Now I use it after I do my face and then put it in to clean and have a fresh razor every time. Perfect. I waited about two weeks to give it a second chance, It really couldn't be as bad as I remember, right? After five minutes I was fed up, and I returned it the same day. Now I am shopping for a midsize trimmer like the barbers use for the hair everywhere else.</review>

<review id="5139">We have two dogs, and we are disappointed with the performance and the quality of the Premier citronella bark collar.  It worked okay with one dog, and not at all on the other.  The collar's quality was not what we expected for the price.  We returned one because the dispenser on the collar leaked.  There was no problem with the return, but the replacement leaked after a while also.  The collar is made of nylon with the usual catch.  However, it has a flimsy adjustment piece that easily becomes unadjusted, making it useless.  We liked the safety concept despite the cloud of citronella created when our one dog was intelligent enough to outsmart the 20 spray maximum.  We had to recharge the dispenser several times during the training period.  Despite its safety, we are disatisfied enough to warn others that this product is not worth a fraction of what it costs.</review>

<review id="5140">I really enjoyed reading the other books in this series, but I couldn't even finish this final book.  It was not only boring, but just didn't give me anything to relate to.  The previous 3 books had deeper messages that anyone could identify with.  This book really had nothing.  The author did want to wrap everything up with a pretty bow, which made the book quite stale.  I skipped ahead a little to verify what I already knew would happen, and finally gave up.  I am sad that the series had to end for me on such a negative note.</review>

It takes absolutely no time pre-heating the water.  Once you turn the power on, almost instantly it's ready to go.  The Breville makes the perfect espresso and milk foam.

<review id="5143">The new look of the software is really confusing. I'm not a computer expert by any means, but I am knowledgeable enough that my family and friends call me to help them fix their computers and software problems, so I'm not a newbie either. I understand the basic idea that some things are on the screen for you to see, the things they consider to be the most important; but the things I use the most, like frame or underlining are now several click away and you can't customize the menus to what you like. They've put up what they think is important and that's it. If you use other features, you're out of luck... it's hunt and peck every time. You also have to learn to think the way they think. If you want to find a feature, it might not be in the menu set of screens you think. They may consider it a different type of feature than you think of it being, so you have start searching all the different sets of menus to find the feature you're looking for. Also, I like to copy and paste from boxes like this, when writing on the internet, for spell checking... well you can't do that anymore because when you paste back your text it appears in HTML format with all the weird stuff that goes along with it. It might be that I'm just too set in my ways and don't feel I have the time to learn a completely new software to do a simple letter. Maybe if I had the time to relearn everything I might find it easier, but I just don't have the weeks it would take to devote to the study of each product (Word, Excel mainly). I got the software and tried it for several months and went back to my old Word and Excel.</review>

<review id="5148">My comments are a warning that I wish I had been given.I've had various versions of Dragon Naturally Speaking and was very happy with Version 9.  Dragon has always been the best voice recognition software for home use.  But this version 10 will not install properly unless your cpu handles SSE2.  Most of us skip that over in the fine print because we figure if our computer is two years old, it should work.  When I say "not install" I mean that it does an install but then gets hung up in a loop.  You cannot turn off your computer and even if you pull the plug, it still runs in the background, not allowing you to remove it.  It took some fiddling and a waste of time to finally get it off the computer.  Then you have to totally reinstall Version 9 -- I imagine my voice files are gone.  This is contrary to Nuance's instructions that if your computer cannot handle V 10, it will notify you and not install. I have not been able to test this version but on the Nuance site, as well as when I Googled comments on Version 10, both standard and preferred, I found many problems, particularly with Vista.  You may be happier if you stay with 9 until they do a better job with the next version.   Otherwise, you may be paying for the shipping both ways and waiting two months for the refund.</review>

<review id="5149">I just received this flat iron today.  I wish I had researched this further before purchasing because I have real concerns about the "authenticity" of this product.  If indeed it is fake, I will be more than disappointed in Amazon for allowing the sale of such a product.  I had not realized that "fake" Chi irons even exsisted.  I guess I shouldn't be suprised as there are many "knock-offs"  of high end products out there.  That old saying "if it's too good too be true" may apply in this case.  I went to Amazon to purchase this for Christmas just to avoid the hassel of running around looking for it locally.  I was pleasently suprised that when I did find it here the price was much lower than I had anticipated.  I ordered it right away, as the price was right and there was time to get it before the holiday.  As I said, I should have done my homework first.  There are fakes out there and I am almost certain this is one of them.  I will be going to a salon to look at a "real" one and will compare it to this.  I could tell right away that the box even looks fake.  The iron itself is very light, and from what I understand, the Chi is a very heavy, quality feeling item.  All I can say to describe the one I have is that it feels "cheap".  I just cant imagine if this is supposed to be a 170.00 flat iron, that it would look and feel the way it does.  I have also found out that the real Chi's have a 3prong plug and this one has a 2 prong.  I also have learned that Chi is not manufacturing their products in China anymore (though I guess some originals were manufactured there).  I am assuming that any "newer" models (that aren't used) would not be manufactured there any longer.  This one  is from China. Anyway, bottom line is, I will be returning this right away and purchasing it from a salon.  If for no other reason, the warranty is not valid from Amazon and even at 70.00, it should have some sort of warranty.  So, I am very dissappointed .  If nothing else,  I hope Amazon looks into this matter to make sure they are indeed selling legitimate merchandise.</review>

<review id="5150">I should have read the reviews before buying....This router (WGR614v6) keeps dropping the wireless connection.

<review id="5152">I bought this router so that I could give internet access to both my desktop PC and my new Macbook Pro laptop.  After a few hours, and a call to my internet service provider, I accomplished this very basic task.  (I use verizon DSL and discovered that I needed to go through some steps before the router would be recognized by my ISP.)  Unfortunately, the installation software crashed several times and I had to reboot my Vista PC at least twice--not fun.  Meanwhile, the instructions for Apple users indicated I should load the CD-ROM, but it turns out it only contained a PDF of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for Apple computers.  Why?  It turns out my Apple laptop recognizes the wireless router right out of the box with no installation needed.  I wish someone had told me that when I started this process!  But getting the router up and running is just the first hassle - you also have to get your new network password protected, otherwise anyone can join it.  Here I had major problems - no one should have to wade through complicated terminology like WEP and WAP and lord knows what else just to enable a simple password protection for a home network.  It should just be a one-step automatic process, rather than requiring us to go boldly into advanced setup screens full of techno-gibberish.  The final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap, it's only a trial version -- you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional $40-60 to some unknown company to unlock all the features!  Not only that, but you can't even use the trial demo on macs - in order make printer sharing work, you have to buy the full version for macs (but not for PCs).  That is absurd and downright deceptive.  Exasperated at 3 AM, I called it quits and will be sending this awful, deceptive product back.  I only hope this review spares one person from a similar strife.</review>

<review id="5153">I bought one of these to replace my old WearEver Popcorn Pumper (RIP). Boy what I would give to resurrect the old pumper!!  The first problem is that this popper is built with the airflow straight up so it blows unpopped kernels out into the bowl. The second problem is that it has such low airflow (necessary due to the direction) that it doesn't get the popped kernels out into the bowl so they build up and scorch. Add to that the fact that, again due to the airflow direction, it pushes a large number of unpopped kernels out with the popped corn. Then add that the butter melting container is also the corn measuring cup, so you need to stop and wash it between every batch. The butter melting cup is plastic, instead of aluminum like the WearEver, so it doesn't have good heat conduction and won't melt butter that isn't already half melted.Overall, don't waste your money.</review>

<review id="5161">This machine is FABULOUS when it works, but the mess it makes when it doesn't (often) is too much to bear.What happens is the basket and carafe don't get aligned perfectly, so the water builds in the basket till it flows down the sides AND back into the water tank.  The flow into the water tank quickly clogs up the pump mechanism.  Water flows all over the counter, making a giant mess.  There's no way to know of correct alignment until the machine starts working and you wiggle the carafe a littleOnce the pump mechanism is full of grounds, The maker is then early impossible to clean and make work again.

<review id="5162">I was really excited about this camera when I got it. It's only the size of a Treo phone. It's easy to take the videos, and simple to hook up to the computer. Installing the software was okay. The problems come when you try to save the clips to your computer. It only saves some of them, and there's no pattern as to which ones it is willing to copy. The program then locks up, and sometimes it even locks up your computer completely so that you can't even shut it down with the shut down command, but you actually have to force it with the power button. When I first discovered the problem, I tried saving the files with Windows, copying and pasting the files. That worked for a couple, but not all of them. So there are clips that I have on the camera, and there is no way to get them off. This is a real pain. I e-mailed the company a couple of times and received their autoresponder saying that a customer service rep will contact me within 24 hours. Two weeks passed, and I never heard anything. In the meantime, I kept messing around with it, and it actually crashed my system, I lost everything. Luckily we were able to recover my data, but that wasn't free, and I'm still reinstalling software.I finally found a phone number and called them. Of course I got a recording saying they would call right back. I eventually got in touch with them, and the company said if I sent them my camera, they could retrieve the videos on it for me, and that they would send a replacement. They also said this was a problem they'd had in the past. It would have been nice if they'd warned their customers in some fashion. I still haven't received the replacement one.But I gave them the benefit of the doubt that they would honor their word, so I ordered another one for a family member because the company supposedly had a download that fixed the copying problem. The update failed. I followed the directions exactly, including removing the batteries, turning my computer off, and starting the whole thing over again. It still failed. It then gave an e-mail and a phone number that is supposedly 24/7. When I called the phone number they told me I had to e-mail tech support. So why did they list the phone number?Connecting it to your computer is the only way to get the videos off the camcorder. So if it won't copy, you can't get them by removing a memory card or tape. That was one limitation I noticed even before I had problems. What if you're at a birthday party and need more memory? You're out of luck.This is cute, but it is not worth the headaches. Spend the money and get a real camcorder.</review>

The first was mindless fun that makes for a fun viewing. The 2nd was also mindless fun and while the action was a bit too over the top it was still a lot of fun. But Transporter 3 was rather lousy in my opinion and it was mindless, but there was no fun to be found.Since the Michael Bay era started action movies have been on the decline and we really haven't had any new action stars to arrive either. The days of Bronson, McQueen, Eastwood, Russell, Arnold and Stallone are gone and while Li & Chan are still good their American movies are rather weak and the newer action stars to arrive are far inferior to those I listed. But Jason Statham on the other hand has the potential to be in the same league as those guys.Statham has the tough guy persona down pat and has the cool factor going for him. He actually reminds me a little bit of Steve McQueen and again I think Statham can be the next Iconic action star, but he really needs to find a new agent. Even though I did enjoy the first two Transporter films they will by no means go down in the action genre. Transporter 3 puts a serious dent in the career of Jason Statham.The screenplay by Luc Besson & Robert Mark Kamen was rather horrible; we don't go into movies like this for their deep and complex plots, but even by popcorn movie standards this script is a wreck. The plot is weak and by the time anything is explained I highly doubt anyone will still care. This is the kind of movie you watch and when it's over you'll be hard pressed to remember a single detail since everything is so forgettable. None of the characters have any depth or anything interesting to do; like I said even by popcorn movie standards this script is still terrible.Director Oliver Megaton fails at brining much to the table granted the script didn't give him a whole lot to work with, but even with that said there's no sense of pacing and the action scenes are quite lackluster. A lot of people complained that the action scenes in Transporter 2 were far too over the top and I'd have to agree. I've seen movies with over the top action scenes, but yet you can suspend your disbelief. Look at some of the movies out of Hong Kong for instance, but yet you can buy into it; But sometimes you can't and that was the problem with Transporter 2, but they were still fun. I wish I could say the same here. The problem wasn't the action scenes were too over the top the problem was they were boring and lifeless. There is also long stretches with any action, which is when things get boring since the weak plot cannot carry the movie, but when the action scenes do start you won't care since they are so weak. Oliver Megaton manages to deliver some decent action scenes in the final act, but even than they still fall a bit flat.Statham does his best with what very little he's given to work with, but even he can't help this sinking ship. Natalya Rudakova makes her screen debut as Valentina and like Statham does her best, but again nothing could save this movie.Like I said the Transporter flicks are everything wrong with Hollywood, but yet they are still fun, but Transporter 3 falls flat on pretty much every aspect and ends up a total bore.As for the Blu-ray release the transfer is one of the best I've seen too bad it's wasted on this. The sound quality is also excellent and the behind the scenes features are average at best.</review>

<review id="5164">There must be a lot of product quality issues for this scale to evoke such a love/hate response among reviewers.  I also found the scale to be neither consistent or accurate.  Each step on the scale comes up with a different weight measurement, none of them matching the scale at the doctors office.  The fat measurements also bounced around and were at least 5 % higher than the number from the fitness trainer.  I carefully followed the directions that came with the scale to produce the most accurate results- all except the disclaimer that the fat measurements may not be accurate for a post-menopausal woman.  The assumptions programmed into the scale must be wrong for a lot of people!  Fortunately the HoMedics version of the scale works for me.</review>

<review id="5165">This is a nice coffee maker.  The coffee that it produces tastes good and it keeps the coffee hot for a long time.  I have only two complaints.1.  The lid is very hard to open if it is closed tightly.  This is because there is a very small area to grasp on the lid.  The lid needs to be improved in future models.2.  The pot will drip almost every time you pour a cup of coffee.Other than those two items, this is a good coffee maker.</review>

<review id="5166">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      If you're old enough to remember the TV cartoon series of this show, then you're too old to enjoy this movie. I came in willing to look the other way at certain weaknesses, knowing full-well that this was first and foremost a Michael Bay movie and, therefor, guaranteed to offer a certain amount of junk. I looked the other way when Bumblebee peed on the officer and overindulged in the first few battles between the lumbering giants (who look great, by the way, even if their voices are for the most part poorly chosen). But then came the scene where the Autobots are "creeping" around the house. In the middle of the suburbs. Giant, twenty-ton machines sneaking around a house and avoiding detection in a moment intended to appeal to the funny bone of perhaps only the most dimwitted of children. It was too much. Not even the excellent remaining battle sequences were enough to jump-start the child in me and reignite the enthusiasm I had when I first watched the animated movie. I just recently watched the animated movie again and I still enjoyed it. But this one ... unfortunately, little remains of the nuances enjoyed by the original series. Expect cheesiness, a few great battles, and a lot of stilted dialogue and plot holes.</review>

<review id="5167">The clock did not work - random numbers, such as 13 and 14 appeared.  This meant one could not set it to begin automatically and the automatic timer did not work. This was bought online to save time which meant we did not have time to deal with repairs and did not realize there was a problem until the coffee pot was unpacked and used.</review>

<review id="5168">[3/12/09 UPDATE: FOR ANYONE WHO DEDUCTS MORTGAGE INTEREST AND IS WONDERING WHETHER AND HOW THEY OWE AMT, PLEASE READ THE COMMENTS ATTACHED TO THIS REVIEW FOR CURRENT STATUS AND INFORMATION REGARDING INTUIT'S HANDLING OF THIS MAJOR SOFTWARE ERROR THAT CAUSES FORM 6251 NOT TO BE GENERATED/FILED AND POSSIBLE UNDERREPORTING OF TAXES OWED.]*   *   *I am an attorney and my wife is a tax attorney, and we have spent hours reverse engineering and confirming TurboTax software problems (with dummy numbers) last night to determine ONCE AGAIN that the brain trust at TurboTax is giving us defective product.  I have used TurboTax since 2005 (only for the spread sheet aspects), and, now that the IRS has made free online filing spreadsheet software available regardless of income (check out the new "Fillable Forms" at the IRS Free File website), THIS WILL OFFICIALLY BE THE LAST YEAR I USE TURBOTAX.  Hooraahhh!  Every year I find numerous errors in their software (from mortgage interest deduction, to carry-overs, to properly completing non-cash charitable donations per IRS requirements, to calculating AMT credits, and now to yet another problem described here), and like many of you guys, every year that I write in about a problem, I get one of their generic, inane replies from some low-level non-attorney who knows nothing about the tax code.  Like years past, I spend more time beta-testing their software bugs than actually doing my tax return.  This year, I easily computed and input all my data for our 2008 return, but I can not get TurboTax to generate (unless I start overriding everything . . . which can lead to other problems) this year's requisite Form 6251 for the AMT so that I can actually e-file my return.  Unlike most people, we do our returns manually per the paper IRS forms, instructions, publications, and tax regs (again my wife is a tax lawyer), and then we input it all in TurboTax to e-file it . . . and like this year, I ALWAYS find major problems in their software.  For example, thousands of Americans are claiming a mortgage interest deduction on Schedule A that they are not entitled to due to the way TurboTax incorrectly distinguishes between home equity indebtedness and home acquisition indebtedness in the context of, e.g., refinanced primary mortgages that include a cash-out component, as well as due to the lack of direction in their menus about the need to compute average mortgage balances.  TurboTax's interview just generically refers you to the IRS publication(s), which everyone tells me they do not have time to do (they tell me that's why they bought the software to begin with, so that they do NOT have to look at the Pubs, Regs, or Code) . . . even my attorney friends who use Turbo don't refer to the tax Pubs to figure out their average mortgage balances, and say instead that they simply claim everything on their 1098 Mortgage Interest Statements (which is wrong!).  TurboTax could easily fix this longstanding gap in their software by hiring a tax attorney and programmer to add the same sort of interview questions and worksheets that are in Publication 936.  But for some reason, after years of making this complaint, they still fail to do this.  Seperate and aside from this problem, now I see this year, another huge software bug (described below) that makes me wonder how many filers with mortgage interest are not including Form 6251 for the AMT (even if they do not owe AMT, the form must still be attached/e-filed in many cases).  As I say to all my friends, if you don't learn the basics of the tax code and check your taxes manually at least somewhat, then you will be in trouble if you solely rely on any version of TurboTax . . . as I have found that TurboTax has done my taxes wrong every year (2005, 2006, 2007, and now 2008).  [This is absolutely true.  Every year, my wife and I have had to override and/or spend days complaining to Intuit about necessary patches, etc.]  Of course, I hope everyone here realizes that all these people that say "TurboTax is Easy and Great" in their 5-star reviews are often the worst type of resources to rely on for an assessment of whether this software is worth your money (and more importantly, time). . . as, how can these cheerleaders possibly be in a position to critique whether the software works correctly if they don't understand what is supposed to happen tax-wise in a given situation?  If you read through ALL the reviews, you will often see the most critical reviews coming from people who evidence some tax knowledge on what TurboTax is supposed to do . . . these people seem far more reliable to me.  Many of these 5-star reviews can be completely discounted by the fact that they were written by people who never had a CPA or lawyer verify that their alleged "so easy, so simple, so wonderful" tax returns were actually done correctly by the software's interview.  As I said above, now that there is no income requirement for completing your return online at the IRS website with their free tax spreadsheet Fillable Forms (brand new option this year!), I will be saying GOODBYE to wasting $30-$60 a year on this software that my wife and I have to beta-test for days.  And you can too.  Trust me, as an attorney, your best options for your taxes are: (1) learn the tax code just enough so that you know what should happen tax-wise during each set of interview questions (and if you do that, then you can now use the IRS "fillable forms" and e-file for free at the IRS website); or (2) pay a little more and use a CPA or attorney.  As your instinct probably tells you, no software program alone is going to magically do this stuff correctly for you; even worse is that it does it wrong after so much wasted time in so many cases.  The wasting of so much of one's time to beta-test this product is just outrageous.  [And waiting to buy the software is just no good, as, in year's past, I was still receiving patches right up to the filing deadline in April!]   Completely unfair that this product continues to dominate the market when the IRS/Treasury should simply do-away with all the lobbying Intuit does here in Washington DC each year, and instead should expand its "fillable forms" with a set of free basic interview questions like Virginia and other states make available online.As far as the specifics of the problem on the Form 6251 not being done correctly, if you are interested, here is my detailed post about this debacle on a thread on TurboTax's Live Community.  [YOU SHOULD ALSO READ THE COMMENTS ATTACHED TO THIS REVIEW FOR MY TAKE AS OF 3/12/09 ON HOW EGREGIOUS THIS ERROR HAS BEEN, AS WELL AS COMMENTARY AND OPINION ON INTUIT'S HANDLING OF IT TO DATE.]Live Community post follows:FORM 6251 not being generated!MAJOR ERROR IN TURBOTAX DELUXE 2008!!My wife and I are attorneys (she is a tax attorney), and once again your software is saying I do not need to submit a Form 6251 when in fact I am REQUIRED by the Form 6251 Instructions to attach a Form 6251 to my return (even though I do not owe AMT this year, the form must still be generated and attached).I am required to attach the Form 6251 because, per the Instructions: "The total of Form 6251, lines 9 through 28, is negative and line 32 would be greater than line 35 if you did not take into account lines 9 through 28." In my case, all of our home mortgage interest is deductible under the regular tax this year, because all of our home equity debt (which happens to be used for investment) is less than 100K; thus, we do not need to complete the TurboTax questions (under the regular tax) for Investment Interest Expense (i.e., because we already are claiming all of this interest as home mortgage interest, we can not and do not need to take it again as investment interest expense simply because the proceeds happen to be used for investment). Thus, TurboTax correctly does not generate a Form 4952 for the regular tax.However, under the AMT regime, I need to enter values on lines 4 and 9 of Form 6251 to add the interest on the home equity debt back into my AMT income and then subtract it out of my AMT income as investment interest expense. I realize this is essentially a wash, but it does not exclude me from the requirement of filing the Form 6251. WHY IS TURBOTAX FAILING TO GENERATE AND E-FILE A FORM 6251 IN THIS CASE? Also, TurboTax should be generating a Form 4952-AMT (for my reference only of course), but IT IS NOT GENERATING ONE EITHER.Clearly, TurboTax's inquiry can't handle a situation where you are not claiming investment interest expense in the regular tax world (because it all qualifies as home equity debt), but then you need to claim it in the AMT tax world. PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP.TURBOTAX NEEDS TO GENERATE BOTH THE FORM 6251 AND FORM 4952-AMT IN SITUATIONS LIKE MINE.Follow-up Message from me to TurboTax programmers:You guys screwed up! Why do I have to beta-test your software every year!?!?!?I just sent you a detailed problem about Form 6251 not being generated. It turns out that at the beginning of the AMT questionnaire, there is an error in your Form 6251 worksheet programming. In response to the AMT question "Tell Us About Your Mortgage Interest," if I input a lower value for "Interest Paid on an Eligible Mortgage" (as compared to the home mortgage interest value from my regular tax Schedule A), then your software does not enter any "home mortgage interest adjustment" in the worksheet (and on line 4 of a Form 6251). Thus, no Form 6251 is being generated when in fact it is REQUIRED per the instructions to the Form 6251.Also, in prior years, there was always a question in TurboTax that would then ask you to adjust for any investment interest expense you might be able to claim under the AMT if any of this above ineligible interest happened to be used for investment (and therefore could be subtracted out on Line 9 of Form 6251).Shame on you TurboTax. I can't even correctly file my return this year until you fix this. I wonder how many people have already filed their taxes without Form 6251, even though they were required to do so (regardless of whether they owe AMT, the Form 6251 must still be attached in these cases).</review>

<review id="5170">I'm not happy with this hub.  The line is very short and by the time you have connected four other USB lines to the hub, you have a mess.  The issue is further exacerbated by the square layout of the hub which forces the connections to shoot off in four different directions. My USB port comes out of the side of the computer and using it makes the workspace at the side of the computer unusable. It does however, work so I gave it two stars.</review>

<review id="5171">I've used TurboTax for years, and always had problems with it.  Always had to pay to efile, price goes up every year, and you have to buy it again, full price (rather than an update/upgrade) every year.  And adding State returns, as most people have to do, almost doubles the base price.  Now the final straw is this latest fiasco with paying for printouts.  So they got caught trying to pull a fast one on their customers, and now they've backed off on it, and added free e-filing - which they should have had all along.  But they've raised the price again this year so you're effectively paying to e-file anyway.  No more TT for me.  I'm going with Tax Cut, and will probably do so from now on, even if it were more expensive, just on principle alone.  I'm done with Intuit.</review>

<review id="5172">Based on the reviews I read on this site and others, I expected better video quality & features from the HF-11. I'm disappointed, and am considering returning the camera. Some background: I have shot footage in 24p & 30p modes, have tried both AV & component connections to the TV (42" Samsung LCD, 1080i), and have burned DVDs using a LOADED iMac Duo Core computer with Final Cut Express to edit the footage & iDVD to create the DVDs.   Yes, I am aware that Final Cut has some limitations when dealing with 1920 x 1080.I feel like Canon is passing off an adequate AVCHD camera, & over-charging the consumers by selling it with low quality (2-3 MP) still shooting/capture options, no charger, a battery you will surely have to supplement (50-80 minutes), and an inadequate microphone. I was very surprised to see that the battery has to be charged through the camera (unless you want to purchase a charger separately). The wind noise when shooting outside is SHOCKING! I guess I'll have to spend another $250.00 to get a directional microphone, a charger, and a battery. Yikes. The low-light performance of the HF-11 is abysmal, & there are some issues with artifacts & "noise," even in adequate light. The footage looks better than my old standard definition mini DV camera's footage did, but it's not great. It definitely does NOT look like "HD." All of that said, there are some nice features of the camera: PROS: --intuitive, easily navigable menus --fantastic color reproduction, if shooting in adequate light --back-light compensation button really works --compact size --footage is nicely organized in camera & easily accessible for review/editing purposes --3 smooth, programmed zoom speeds --easy button---no joke! --many pre-programmed settings for specific shooting environments --no memory cards or tapes (unless you think you'll need more than 3 hours of recording time, then you can add a class 6 or better SDHC card) I'll update this review if my opinion of the camera changes. Good luck with your search for the perfect consumer HD camcorder! *********************UPDATE: 01/15/09*********************I received (& promptly experimented with!) my Canon DM-100 directional mic today.  WOW.  I shot footage in identical outdoor conditions with and without it.  What a difference!  Using the DM-100, my daughter's speaking voice was perfectly clear at 30+ feet, outside on a windy day with the heat pump running.  If you shoot in noisy or outdoor environments, THIS IS A MUST-HAVE ACCESSORY.Unfortunately, the video quality is still quite poor.  If only there were an attachment to address that problem.*********************UPDATE: 01/26/09*********************Is it possible that there's some sort of burn-in period with HD video cameras?  The footage looks a bit better, but still not HD quality.  I've spent quite a bit of time doing internet research and talking to Apple techs to make sure all of my settings are correct in Final Cut and iDVD.  They are!  The footage DOES look great when piped directly to my TV via component video cable, but the DVDs I have made are not nearly as crisp.When the new Canon cameras come out in March, I'll sell this one on eBay and buy a Canon HF S10.  The new models will have an 8.59 megapixel CMOS, a Digic III processor, and 8 megapixel still shots.  This model has a 3.3 megapixel CMOS, a Digic II processor, and 3.1 megapixel still shots.  The new ones will be so far ahead of this camera I bought in January.  If you can wait for the new models, please do so!  I wish I had.</review>

<review id="5178">Here's the story of my experience with this dryer.I have long, wavy, coarse, fine hair that is often a styling nightmare.  I need to build volume AND fight frizz, so it's an on-going battle at times.  Honestly, I was crusing along just fine with my myriad of hair products, my round brush and my good old regular 1875 watt dryer until about a month ago when my stylist told me the top layer of my hair looked burned.  She concluded in was my dryer and promptly told me to go out and by a CHI.  Of couse I was distressed by the news and figued I should begin the quest for a new dryer.  In my research, I contemplated the CHI and the T3s but decided that maybe I should start with this one, since the price point was much lower, the tecnology was similar and the reviews were mostly positive.So.....I was very excited when it showed up and was hoping to have the glorious results that other have shared here.  Alas for me, that was not the case.   On the day of my new dryer's debut, I made sure to do all my usual hair ministrations and regualr routine so that I could do an honest comparison.  The first thing I noticed was the the dryer did not produce much heat at all, which made me think it would indeed cause less damage, but made me worry if it would be able to put shape and style in.  To the dryer's credit, it did seem to be drying my hair faster despite the lack of heat.My next issues was that the dryer produced a rather odd oder...and not a pleasant one.  I would have to equate to GARLIC.   I have nothing against garlic, but it is hardly the aromatic experience I am after while blow drying my hair.So, when the drying process was complete, my hair did look a bit less frizzy, but it was also very flat at the crown and had kind of a strange poufy, fluffy texture throughout.  It is difficult to describe, but I can assure you it was not a look that anyone would covet.I was worried about styling due to the lack of heat and I was correct to be concerned.  Trying to put any shape or volume in was nearly impossible.  My bangs were particularly awful.  To make sure it wasn't just a random Bad Bang Day that no mechanical device could hope to conquer, I wet my bangs down again and used my old dryer and they turned out much better.Anyway...with the clock ticking and my hair looking utterly awful, I was forced to make an emergency plan involving hot rollers.  I hoped they would at least add a little style and volume so I could get out the door.  At first...it seemed to have worked and when the rollers came out my hair looked halfway decent.  Unfortunately, within an hour the volume and wave had compeltely fallen out and I was left with the fluffy, shapless mess I had started with. To make matters worse, my hair retained the faint garlic-y aroma that the dryer produced nearly all day.  So, In summation my use of this dryer left me flat, fluffy, shapeless and giving off a garlic smell.  I can harldy give this my endoresement!  I'm glad that people have had success with this product, but my experience was not a good one.</review>

For the past weeks, I had been working tirelessly to plan the release party for the local independent bookstore I work at, and was rewarded with the number of teens that showed up to eagerly await the Twilight Saga's conclusion with me. I only hope that they got some gratification out of the thing they had been waiting for.The novel's three books-- Book 2 being told from Jacob's perspective-- give a refreshing break to Bella's immature, one-track mind. Book 1 is an abomination to every opinion I had formed about about the previous books. Not only does Meyer recap way more than necessary-- a little recap in any sequel is inevitable, but this was just downright ridiculous-- but her retelling of events that took place before the actual time frame of the novel is weakly amateur. The sequencing is off (for instance, the conversation with the Cullens about the immortal children should have been made evident to Bella AFTER she had begun having the increasingly haunting dreams about a child)and everything is told with a strange, glossed-over humor that makes you yearn for the more raw accounts presented in Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse. Bella-- I say Bella because the reader is at this point experiencing everything from her perspective--seems numb everything as Meyer strictly writes by what she is doing, instead of what she is feeling; making for poor writing especially in the first person.And then comes the big slap in the face, after everything set up in the previous novels goes by without a hitch or a blip on the emotional radar. Bella's pregnancy-- wrong on so many levels, what with her emotional immaturity and lack of matronly sense-- causes the high school romance teens adored and coveted to take on an official, adult aura. How could this happen? Bella, the clumsy, quirky new kid in town, and Edward, the seventeen-year old, strikingly handsome heartthrob, are now PARENTS? Not only does this cause teens to cringe-- I should know, I am one-- but it kills the romance for anybody who does not understand what it is like to have a child, myself included. One would presume that Meyer, knowing most of her fan base was made up of teenagers, would steer clear of this route for Edward and Bella. After this maddening plot twist, we find our selves in Jacob's shoes for the commencement of Book 2. Strangely enough, I was irritated enough with the way that Bella's life was going to enjoy Jacob's strong, angsty take on life, and it was, as I mentioned earlier, quite refreshing to see the situation from someone else's point of view. Humor is reintroduced through clever dialogue, and Meyer seems to get her groove back as she navigates out of territory of a sexual nature, which was clearly uncomfortable for her. However, after Jacob's all-too-predictable-and-really-quite-creepy imprinting episode, we land right back into Bella's shoes.Book 3 is a slight improvement over Book 1, the main irritant only being Bella's ridiculous selection of the name "Renesmee" for her child. As a reader, I can honestly say that it was extremely difficult to care at all for the fate of the child. She monopolizes Bella's affections (Where's Edward? Hello, that's what we came here for...) and is the root of a big misunderstanding, of course involving the Volturi. The facts remain that Renesmee was introduced too late into the Saga for the audience to understand Bella's attachment, not after her central focus in life had been Edward for so long. Speaking of Edward, how does he feel about his daughter and Jacob's relationship? Why don't we see a paternal side to him? Who knows.As for Bella's newly acquired "newborn vampire" status, everything works out perfectly fine, she is of course able to resist human blood because of her amazing self control and can shield herself and her family on top of everything! How maddeningly, predictably, ridiculously, fantastically convenient for her.And then the dramatic, tension-filled conclusion... where nothing actually happens except for a whole lot of talking and predictable self-realizations. The epic, anticipated confrontation with the Volturi takes on the demeanor of a court trial and everybody the audience cares about walks away without a scratch. From the moment I finished Twilight, it was easy enough to perceive that the following books would revolve around Bella and Edward's relationship, and how they would make things work with their supernatural differences. The real threats to their happiness presented in New Moon and Eclipse seemed like they would be the central focus of Breaking Dawn. Everything, from Bella's becoming a vampire to Jacob's attachment to Bella to how Charlie would react, was far to conveniently sewn up, with the added bonus of a baby thrown in for fun. All I can say is that this is the only Twilight book I will not be rereading, and I wish Stephenie Meyer better literary success with whatever projects she chooses to pursue.</review>

<review id="5184">Just took my 5th pill - noticed yesterday afternoon that I felt dizzy.  Now after the 5th pill I immediately got dizzy.  I don't know whether to continue or not - usually if you have a side effect it will pass within a couple of weeks - but I don't honestly see any difference in my appetite or my overall being.  I'm on estrogen for menopause and 3 other medications, but the reviews I read said that it doesn't interact with any drugs.  I really don't know if I'm going to continue.....</review>

<review id="5189">I like the concept of this trimmer with the vacuum and all, but I'm really annoyed that the people who make these things won't tell you what lengths the comb settings will trim to.  Even if you go to a store to look at one, they have it all sealed in plastic that you have to cut open just to take a look at it.  So I got this thing home to see if it would trim to my preferred length, and no it won't.  I'm liking the stubble look, and about 3-4 days growth looks best on me.  This trimmer only goes down to what represents 7-8 days growth for me.  I have another Panasonic trimmer that works fine, but it has the same issue.  I can take the comb off and cut the stubble down to about one day's length and then let it grow back a few days, but I'm getting really tired of doing that.  I think these manufacturers should specify their trimming lengths so you can do a reasonable buying comparison.</review>

<review id="5192">This product never worked. Looking for help from the company was useless. Seller refused to accept back this broken Item. I'm out of $71.00. Company hasn't responded about an exchange either. Amazon hasn't intervened either! Mjcarter</review>

<review id="5193">Having read the other reviews of this product on this site, I decided to go ahead and give these collars a shot despite some of the problems other reviewers had encountered.  I ordered three of these products from this site, and when they arrived, not a single one of them worked - at all.  They were completely useless and despite trying everything other reviewers and the manufacturer suggested, these products are completely useless.  Although I have contacted the manufacturer of this product about the defects, I would still like the buyer to be aware that if purchasing this product from this website, that if the product does not work, it can not be returned for a refund or even exchanged.  Thus, your credit card will still be billed, your dogs will still be barking, and you may get stuck with products that are worthless.</review>

<review id="5195">When I was in school, my cat used a Drinkwell fountain, which he loved.  After I moved across the country to California, I decided to buy him another fountain, this time a Petmate Deluxe.  What a terrible mistake.  This beast is amazingly loud!  The pump makes a very irritating grating sound, a lot like a fan that's misaligned such that the blades grate against the sides.  It's an incessant grinding plastic noise that I can hear two rooms away.  The Petmate sits in my kitchen and actually rivals the noise of the dishwasher.  Although it wasn't enough to scare my cat, after three days I couldn't take it anymore and unplugged it.  Now it sits there like an overpriced plastic water bowl.  At least the Petmate was limited to a splashing water noise, which was actually somewhat calming.  There is nothing calming about this.  Had I not thrown away the box, I'd return it today.Please don't buy this!!!</review>

<review id="5196">I do not recommend this product. Many people are having problems with random button presses. This makes the product unusable. I would be flying in MS Flightsim and all of a sudden, my landing gear could drop without warning, flaps move, etc.I sent the product back after being told to do so by Saitek support.As soon as I unplugged this product and went back to my old stick, the problem went away.</review>

<review id="5197">I bought this to replace a larger microwave, Goldstar brand, which I would still buy but are no longer available.  The Sharp, every once in a while, would not start for me.  It was still under warranty, a repair shop was not too far from me.  The repair man could not duplicate or diagnose the problem for me and the warranty period was almost over.  I've since discovered on my own what the cause is and it's happening more often.  If it starts and immediately shuts down, I have to open the door and close it hard, often more than once, then it will run.  This problem began at less than one year of ownership.  I will not purchase another Sharp and would not recommend this model to anyone.</review>

<review id="5198">Bought this to replace my Norelco T-1000 (then found out I could have bought a replacement battery for 10 bucks)which worked just fine until the battery died. The decision to buy was mostly impluse, though I did check Amazon's ratings, but I forgot to read the lowest ratings first! I keep a close cut beard or stubble, so I don't need the adjustable settings above maybe # 3 ...I also don't care about having a vacuum cause I trim over the sink and just rinse it out. Seems like they concentrate on that feature more than the basic design.  Not impressed.The "contour" spring loaded thing is a joke, I removed it.  The charger unit is so bulky and heavy that it will not hang on the wall socket.  I have to use an extension cord from the wall and set the "brick" charger on the counter.  Did not like the feel of the unit right out of the box either, it feels rather cheap (which it is), unlike my old unit.  It's fairly large and and bulky, like the charger!Don't know what the blue plastic floating shield thing is in front of the cutters, but it makes hard to judge depth when trimming without the adjustable guide on.I'll use it for the time being, then donate it to the thrift store when I find a better unit.  Not worried about paying forty bucks, as I can afford to toss away cash at the this moment.   Got free shipping too, unlike Ebay sellers that are charging 20 bucks to ship!</review>

Wake up, Logitech. Windows isn't all there is.</review>

<review id="5202">I've been shaving with the Braun Syncro 7680, and can honestly tell you that it's provided the best shave ever.  I decided to give myself an upgrade this past Christmas to the new 7 series Pulsonic expecting that the new shaver would provide an even better shave- especially for the hefty price tag.  The new system seems to shave a bit quicker, but would irritate a lot more and shave no where near as close.  I could go two days with the old shaver before "needing" to shave again.  With the new Pulsonic, I would need to shave everyday- bummer.  After hoping for the best and allowing my face to adjust for 4 weeks, nothing changed.  What a disappointment- I've since returned the shaver under the 60 day money back guarantee.  I'm sticking with my old Braun- the grass isn't always greener...</review>

<review id="5204">After using the drive for 6 months, the drive all of a sudden becomes unresponsive and won't connect to my computer. It makes a whirling noise as if it's powering up and then becomes very silent.  Western Digital makes POS UNRELIABLE portable hard drives. The data that I lost was very very valuable to me as most of it were from trips all over the world! Lesson learned! Never Buy from Western Digital ever AGAIN! I now have a Seagate portable hard drive. They're a little bit on the expensive side, but at least they have a 5 year warranty and are not made of sh%t like Western Digital! Now it's going to cost $750 just to retrieve my data. At least all is not lost.  Please Google "western digital passport drive failures" and you will understand the hell I went through. WD should offer data recovery as part of WD's warranties b/c of the high failure rate of their drives.    If you guys want a reliable portable drive for storing data, DO NOT BUY ANY WESTERN DIGITAL PRODUCTS! You get what you pay for!  Buy either a Maxtor or a Seagate drive. Both are reliable and are made of high quality materials. There's a reason why WD hd's are cheaper than main competitors, and unfortunately I had to find out the hard way.</review>

<review id="5205">Just saw him on Oprah and have seen him on other TV shows like the Today Show.  I have to say, the book might be ok, but his TV appearances are terrible. They are nothing but confusing to people who are already clueless about nutrition.  He does not make it clear enough that he is only talking about choices between one crappy commercial processed food over another. That doesn't make either one a good choice. And judging by some of the comments here, it doesn't sound like he makes it any clearer in the book.What people need to know about commercial processed foods is: 1) Avoid it. Eat real food instead. 2) Read the nutritional data. There's no telling what's hidden in there. You can't guess, and what you know about real food doesn't apply. It isn't real food. You must read the nutritional info.Besides, which food is the better choice will vary from brand to brand.Comparisons between eggs and bacon and french toast sticks are dumb. The first thing to point out is they are not talking about the French toast I make which doesn't have anywhere near 700 calories and is much better for you than bacon. And how about suggesting eggs without bacon? How about eggs scrambled with tomatoes or salsa? How about explaining that the bagel is bad for you because it's incredibly dense? How about suggesting they just have toast? Why compare it to a donut and imply it's better? How is that helpful? How about explaining that the reason the Arby's Market sandwich is 'better' than the melt is because it's ginormous. And the cheese isn't so fattening on the melt because isn't really cheese.I don't know why people have so much trouble understanding nutrition, but I watch my coworkers make dumb choices for lunch each day as they wonder why they can't lose weight. I think it's because these TV shows are delivering such confusing messages.</review>

<review id="5207">This is a fun product to own and use. Dead simple, surprisingly good quality and I enjoyed it, especially with the underwater case. But the product has simply stopped working twice in the year that I owned it. The first time it was still covered by the six month warranty and the manufacturer replaced it very quickly. But then that unit broke, too. Now that it is no longer under warranty, the manufacturer said that they can try to recover any video (my entire Caribbean vacation, no less) for me, but they will not replace it and there is no guarantee they can recover any of the video. I was not putting any undue stress on the camera and it did not get wet. It just stopped working.</review>

<review id="5208">This movie is not for everyone.  Some of the blood and guts humor was not funny to me. I know, it is just a movie........just a movie not for me.</review>

<review id="5209">First of all let me say that I've read the first three books in the series, and am a pretty big fan. I must say that I was disappointed in the final book. I'm reminded of my feelings for the Matrix trilogy. Let me explain...I LOVE the first Matrix movie. It was groundbreaking, unique, creative, and just plain GREAT! Then the second movie came out, and although I thought it was good, it wasn't nearly as good as the first film. Then the final movie in the trilogy was released...and to put it lightly, it SUCKED. I felt like they got to the end, and had to wrap things up, and they just didn't know what to do. And that's pretty much how I felt about this book. Parts of it were good, but for the most part I was disappointed in how she chose to deal with a lot of the plot lines. The Edward, Bella, and Jacob love triangle for example. I just felt like she coped out. It's a love triangle, people get hurt, usually everyone involved. But not in Stephenie Meyers world...Things were a little too tidy by the end for me. The series is really popular, so I'm sure she (the author) was being rushed to write the final book. A large part of me wishes that she'd just taken another year, and put out a better book....</review>

<review id="5210">The one I bought worked fine at first.  Technical support was good but once they determined the unit was defective, their customer service was extremely bad.  Tech support can't transfer you to customer support and you need customer support to get a replacement unit.  Customer support doesn't answer their phones (I was on hold for 45 minutes).  They only sometimes answer email.  Due to this experience, I will never buy a Linksys product again.  They don't offer enough to overcome the bad customer support experience.</review>

<review id="5211">This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)      I wanted to like Tropic Thunder. I was looking forward to seeing it having heard some good reports. In the end though, I just didn't enjoy it. There were some funny moments, and the production was very good - it's slick and impressive to look at, especially on blu-ray. But the film is let down by a dull plot, and empty characters. I just didn't care about any of them - they were all one-dimensional. I know, in a way that that is the point - they are all supposed to be one-dimensional actors - but that joke kind of carries on into this film, making Stiller, Black, Downey et al all seem boring. Downey Jr. is great, but the joke wears thin, and is kind of dealt with in the first few minutes of the film.I found myself longing for the more nuanced character comedies of Steve Martin, John Candy, Chevy Chase etc. The Three Amigos, for example, was a similar type of film, carried off with a more absurd humor, and some genuine warmth. For all the explosions, Tropic Thunder left me cold.</review>

<review id="5213">I was simply looking for a relatively inexpensive mp3 player to take the place of my mp3-compatible portable CD player, and this one looked ideal.  Like you, I read various reviews online and, probably again like you, decided that it was impossible to meaningfully sort the adoring from the despising.  Well, you can believe the comments of the frustrated.After my first-night rush to get songs on the thing, I noticed that it wasn't reading the ID3-tag information (e.g., artist, song, album), which is fatal on a device that sorts based on it.  Despite reasonable customer service, the SanDisk tech folks were unable to solve my problem.  In fact, one of them sent me something that he described as a too-new-to-be-online firmware update.  As it happened, the firmware was for a device that doesn't even exist and... it crashed my Sansa beyond repair.So I returned it and received a new one within a week through Amazon's fantastic service.  A little thought and research, and I realized that the problem that the SanDisk techies hadn't been able to solve was that my computer (just a couple of years old) apparently couldn't work with the unit in MTP (music transfer protocol) mode, so I merely had to change the Sansa's USB setting to MSC mode.  Perfect... well, at least until I tried to load a small label's promotional disc of 100 mp3s onto the Sansa and a single non-mp3 file on the CD crashed the thing again.  This time, Amazon, realizing that the problem was either the product or me, wouldn't exchange it, offering instead (again, with that fantastic service) a full refund.After further research and impulse, I picked up a Philips GoGear.  (Unfortunately, I couldn't buy it from Amazon, because Wal-Mart is the only store that sells an 8GB version, which is the exact same price point as the 6GB version that everybody else sells.)  Granted the GoGear is approximately twice the price of this Sansa, but you pick up another 6GB of memory and a color screen.More importantly, the GoGear has the ability to be reset and the included software includes options for further reviving the mp3 player.  And lo and behold, when I tried to load that promotional CD onto it, the software warned me that one file wasn't a recognized format, thus avoiding any problems altogether.In other words, the GoGear gave the impression that somebody thought the software through, rather than doing what SanDisk seems to have done: throwing its product on the market in too much of a hurry to accommodate the slightest error on the customer's part.</review>

<review id="5214">RIP OFF!!!  This set is only HALF of the 4th season.  That was not made clear in the product discription.

<review id="5215">These types of body fat analyzers, tend to overestimate % body fat in lean people, underestimate in obese populations, and the equations it uses to calculate body fat are for specific populations.  Do not confuse the consistency of the readings with accuracy.  As well as the previously listed problems, these hand to hand body fat monitors only measure through the shortest path so the best case scenario is that you are getting a measure of your upper body's body fat extrapolated over your entire body.  Foot to foot monitors share a similar problem.  If you have the opportunity to see a professional at a gym, or fitness club, and have them assess your body fat with skinfolds that is a much better alternative than relying on these monitors.  Also a health professional will be able to share more details on why these monitors are not worth the money you pay for them.</review>

<review id="5220">I'm computer savvy but don't know very much about networks.  I was shocked, then, when I bought this router and a netgear wireless card and was up and running in minutes.  For 3 months, it worked wonderfully, and I'm now hooked on wireless.  But then, for no real reason, the router just stopped working.  I couldn't get an answer from email or the website, and like other reviewers have mentioned, the tech-support is a joke (30 minute wait, can't understand them because it's outsourced in India, don't solve anything anyway).

<review id="5223">Javier Bardem is always good and solid, and the Spanish locations are gorgeous. The music is nicely chosen too.However, there's a big problem with much of the dialogue, which does not seem authentic; there is no logic to Cristina wanting to stay with the nasty Maria Elena and her ex-husband Juan Antonio; there's no logic, either, in Vicky wanting to go off with J.A. after she's just gotten married; the narration is incredibly annoying and unnecessary.Woody Allen can do much better than this.</review>

<review id="5224">After buying a composite video cable and NUMEROUS attempts to get video out to my TV, nothing...I was able to get PHOTOS out, but never VIDEOS.

<review id="5225">While i agree that there's some element to truth in "manifesting" your reality by having a positive attitude and envisioning what you want, the overly simplified way this DVD talks about this subject is both insultiing a superficial.  In some ways, this is an incredibly cynical philosophy which essentially blames the individual for not "manifesting" hard enough if they suddenly find their wildest dreams aren't coming true.  And what about individuals born into difficult circumstances rather than a life of privilege?  This "philosophy" assumes we all start from a common footing, which is just NOT the case.  I think the most shameful aspect of this DVD is that the ultimate goal primarily revolves around acheiving material wealth.  Personally, i'd like to believe there's more to life than owning an expensive car or making a million bucks.  But hey, i guess they were able to "manifest" suckering me into watching their movie and helping make them more rich!  Avoid at all costs.</review>

I do not get how anyone calls this an HD camera. The video quality is awful and very pixely, while the sound is pretty good. I do not understand how this company calls this camera HD and I am confused why anyone would sell this camera. I have posted "HD" videos on YouTube and am surprised how bad the picture quality is. Sometimes it doesn't even work with YouTube and I get an "unknown error has occured" message. I am very frustrated by the horrible softwear and confused by the fact it advertises downloading easily to youtube. I have tried many different settings to make it HD but to no avail and I have even tried the HDMI cable and hooked it up to my full HD TV. I am disappointed at this company for not having any customer support and since I live in Wisconsin I cannot return it. I do not recommend this product and wish I would have saved my money to get a real HD camera. If you want a knockaround camera for a mediocre price then I can see getting it. It is not an HD camera and if you have problems with it good luck finding a customer support.</review>

<review id="5228">Useless product - waste of money. Does not work - causes Mac to freeze (wasn't that supposed to be a thing of the past?!?). Never was able to copy ANYTHING onto it - had to manually shut off computer. AVOID AT ALL COSTS (even this very inexpensive one)!</review>

<review id="5229">The camera is a neat idea. I bought it to take videos of my family on Christmas. Major problems as people have already noted are: errors during transfer of videos to a computer (which requires a firmware/software update which I haven't been able to download yet) and difficulty with youtube uploading. Other suggestions for future models would be to be able to pause, fast-forward, and rewind the videos while watching them on the camera itself. Also a rechargeable battery that charges through the USB port would be nice. A USB cable would be nice also as the camera blocks other USB ports when plugged into the computer.The nice things: it is really easy/fun to use and takes good videos which you can watch directly on the camera or TV. The drag has been trying to do anything else. Customer support seems very accesssible by email/phone, 24/7 and at least they provided the firmware update (though I can't get it to download yet).Like everyone has commented, a good idea but a sad disappointment to those who got it for Christmas. I haven't returned mine yet.</review>

<review id="5230">I interpret this either as 1. Intuit doesn't value Mac users as much as Windows users or 2. Intuit wants to lock out TaxCut in the Mac market. In either case, this product merits 1-star for Mac users, IMHO. I'm outside of the 30-day return window unfortunately. Note that TaxCut imports TurboTax files.</review>

<review id="5231">OK, so the books were all right. Mrs. Meyer managed to write four vampire books without really mentioning anything gory, perverse or even slightly disgusting. She made a family of perfectly harmless, mostly charming, vampires, and she made it work. She also made an absurd number of teen girls believe that vampires have no fangs and sparkle in sunlight. When a really good book is turned into a low-budget film, it may turn out OK, or even great. When a book that's pretty much as good as "the da Vinci code" is turned into a low-budget film, it's almost destined to suck(bad pun intended). I've watched this film twice now, and it's simply awful! Billy, Charlie, Rosalie, Alice, Emmett and Bella's classmates did quite well in my opinion, while the others actually evened up the score through their horrible incapacity of acting convincingly! And then all the scenery - OK, we get it, there are trees in Forks! They're green, and really tall! But we don't have to see each and every one of them from three different angles!Still, and this is why I give the film 2 stars, it has some qualities! First of all, Charlie is great. He is fun, and he's convincing. Second, you can watch it with friends and make fun of almost everything from the beginning to the end. You don't get that kind of fun from comedies! That's one star for each!</review>

<review id="5232">The On/Off button broke within two weeks of purchasing. I sent it back to Philips Norelco three months ago and have not seen nor heard from them. I would not recommend this product nor company to anyone.</review>

<review id="5233">On the first attempt to perform a full back-up, the drive completely failed and has not recovered. It does have a warranty but Simpletech refuses to pay for shipping to them so now I'm out an additional $20 because they want it FedExed. Don't buy this product!</review>

<review id="5234">It's a point and shoot camera with an awful interface. A lens soon to be scratched were you to actually use it. My digital camera has a video mode that is easier to use than this one. Maybe if you don't expect much it's ok, but as far as I'm concerned this thing should be relegated to the dust bin of consumer electronics soon to be ground up into it's elemental parts. It's going back.</review>

<review id="5235">I just returned this camera...horrible! The concept is perfect, the actual product is crap. The video is OK, BUT, I have a macbook & it did not sync up properly. The photos would sync but not the video. The lady at the store said it would, as did the actual packing literature, but I was unable to get video over. The still camera function on this is HORRIBLE. Worse than my 8-year-old kodak we let the kids play with. You can hold the camera PERFECTLY still but somehow 1/2 of the pictures would still be very blurry. Too bad this product was so disappointing. I had very high hopes & wanted to love it....</review>

<review id="5236">I have been using this program for the last 4 years thinking it will get better each year but it doesn't. Installation is the worst. I have yet to get a clean install and when done with the program, getting it off yoursystem is just as messy. The program, once installed and updated runs fine and is fairly easy to use. Taxes are a mystery to most of us and when looking for answers in simple to understand form, the help that you get is the federal tax instructions, which are usually not much help. The review for errors is a good feature, but the errors reported can sometimes be vague or hard to determine what you have to do to fix them. Get ready to waste a lot of paper printing your final. It would be nice to have a preview to see exactly what your getting when you print your forms..</review>

<review id="5238">I have used Turbo Tax for years but thankfully heard about the trick Intuit has pulled off for 2008.  By charging an additional fee for every return printed or filed over one makes this tax preparation software very expensive.  This is not diclosed on the packaging and a major change from previous years.  I usually do several "Pro Forma" returns for tax planning purposes and would have had to pay an additional $10 for each one. This "back loading" of fees has forced me to grab TaxCut, and I will provide a review after using it some.</review>

<review id="5239">I just had to review this book because I feel it really falls short of the first two in so many ways. Let me start out by saying I did enjoy Twilight and New Moon, and I feel SM is very talented.  But something's lacking in this sequel. I think what's missing is Bella's integrity, well and her passion for true love.Loving two men at once is just shallow and frivolous, imo. I think it's designed to make Bella seem desireable or attractive that two men are laying themselves at her feet, but it makes her seem vain and capricious. I feel it makes Edward and Jacob both look pathetic and doesn't coincide with her character displayed in the first two books. She's supposed to be in love with Edward, completely in love. She is supposed to want to live forever with Edward, so what's her obsession with Jacob about? I know he helped her when Edward had gone, but now Edward's back and she's actually cheating on Edward. I think SM should have given Jacob a girlfriend and maybe they all could have become friends eventually,and double dated or something. This love triangle doesn't work for me.Way before Jacob's aggressive makeout behavior, Bella is leading Jacob on big time, I mean big time. Hugging him, holding his hand, reaching out to him all the time, wanting to be alone with him, missing him. She even leaves the slumber party with her vegetarian vampire friends to run off to "be with poor Jacob."I'm a little sickend by this. IT's like she needs a boy in every corner at all times. She can't even wait for Edward to get back from a hunting trip. She's also very co-dependent. I could deal with the co-dependence a little better, if she wasn't so insincere. It's like she's not the same Bella. I did love the first 2 books. I hope in the 4th book that SM can get some of Bella's integrity back</review>

<review id="5240">I know the LCD of the new Macbook is not very good, but I didn't expect that it is is that bad. It is not on par with quite some other laptops on the market with much lower price tags.1. The black and contrast level very poor, comparing side by side with another laptop, the darkest black you can get is a dark gray.2. The viewing angle is extremely narrow. I am NOT as picky as to use a laptop while walking around, just move my head a little bit produces noticeable artifacts.So when viewing or watching dark toned pictures or videos, ink patches like effect is very obvious, though for more vibrant colored scenes like the factory supplied background pictures and the ones showing in Apple store, with the help of the bright LED backlight and glossy coating, it does not seem to be that bad.The new Macbook is definitely trendy and tremendously good looking as a successful consumer electronic, but the poor quality display will surely diminish its usefulness as any slightly serious tool for photo and video processing, which ironically boasted as the Mac's appeal all along.On the bright side, the Mac OS is very responsive and quick comparing to Windows Vista, thought you may find that the system settings configurable with the UI interface is limited to make the system less complex. One thing I found missing is that you can not change to use larger fonts at system level, it might be hard to read some texts.</review>

<review id="5241">Pros: FastCons: there is no lock when the drive is in the extended position so if the USB slot offers any resistance it slides back in. You have to keep pushing the slider mechanism to get it inserted into any USB slot properly.

<review id="5243">HP 2133 MINI-NOTE PCWhen I found out that HP was jumping on the bandwagon and introducing their own version of the increasingly popular netbook format of PC, I thought I had to have one, based on the HP name if nothing else.  My antique Vectra still churns along handling everything that overtaxes my Sony Vaio.  Plus, this looked a little more user-friendly size-wise than my 7 inch screen Eee PC.  I really wanted to love this netbook and nick-named it my "h-pod" for "hp". The ads raved about the nearly-full-size 92% proportioned keyboard.  I have since figured out that this "center-of-key" to "center-of-key" spacing is standard on all 10" notebooks; at least all the ones I have.  They just eliminated the spacing between the keytops, thus making it nearly impossible to "feel" the key locations while "touch" typing and fooling the observer into thinking it's more acreage than it is.  Then they colored it in such a way that it is impossible to distinguish one key from another except in the brightest of light conditions, just in case you want to look for some not regularly used key, like F3 or whatever.  Hey, look everybody, what HP invented this time - a fake/real keyboard, wow!Then they give you "suse Linux by Novell" or whatever it is called and that is supposed to be a plus.  Seems like my antique Toshiba T1200 loads MS-dos 5.0 in a lot less time than this.  Wow, talk about slow.  Come on, HP, you don't give us that much battery time on this thing.  And, hey Novell, ever think somebody might want to plug in a printer?  But, then in another penny-pinching move by HP, like not installing Windows XP, they give you a whole TWO usb ports to choose from.  Whoopee.  One for a broadcaster for the external mouse and keyboard which you will absolutely want; another one for the Flash Drive we all carry around in our pocket or purse, and.....hmmm....printer or camera, anyone?(I was thinking just the other day - didn't HP used to make decent scientific calculators back in the day?  Oh no, I just remembered something - Reverse Polish Notation - another HP innovation, yikes.)They say the case is aluminum and it really does look like a fine piece of equipment when it is closed up, but, I did not trust them so I carefully removed some of the anodizing on one small part of the base and did a continuity check and confirmed, yes, it really is what they advertised.  Score one for HP.  Another very nice touch is the illuminated on/off pushbutton for the touch-pad.  This is great for when I actually use the on-board keyboard, since I am otherwise constantly scrolling all over the place with the palms of my hands as I try to do some typing.  Good move, HP.The screen is as nice as any other I have.  The sound seems okay.  In general it seems pretty sturdy, but it is quite heavy, considering there is no hard-drive included in the cheap-o version I bought.Would I recommend this piece of equipment?  Not at all.  Will I keep the one I have?  Well, I saw a 500 gig hard-drive on eBay for under $100, so I will probably put that in and install either "98 second edition" or "XP" and use it for file-transfers or system-monitoring in my hobby room - something that does not require a lot of power or speed and where the overweight condition does not matter.  For my carry around computing I'll stick with my Eee PC or even the Acer Expire One rather than this dinosaur.</review>

<review id="5245">Ok, got my X8 and I'm testing it right next to my G9 on a SteelSeries SX Mouse Pad.What I have noticed:  X8 is louder the the G9 when you slide it, I have tried all 3 sets of pads. I can't tell any difference between the 3 sets of feet. And I didn't see any description telling me how they are different.It is easy to accidentally push the two thumb buttons, which is annoying when web surfing because they are back and forward buttons.X8 scroll wheel is much hard to rotate, and it being larger in size then the G9 makes you lift and reset your index finger a lot more. G9 scroll wheel is both click and smooth scroll styles, X8 is only click.You have to install the X8 software to change the default DPI which are 500 - 1000 - 4000. G9 max is 3500. I find normal daily use of 3000 perfect on both mice. People with larger screens tend to use higher DPI. I'm running at 2560x1600 + 2048x1152I also ended up changing the vertical scrolling speed.The DPI screen is cool, the lights are ok. I was hoping you could change the color and even turn off the lights but I don't see that in the current software.The quick charging / cable is really good. I hated when my Logitech MX ran out of juice, I would have to put it in the cradle and plug in my laptop mouse until I was recharged. Wireless is not as cool as it used to be, the G9 mouse cable seems invisible as it does seem to slide better then the X8. Plus you don't have a black hockey puck cluttering up your desk. I would say most people get wireless to clean up there desk, however the X8 adds clutter.So over all I will test this out a few more weeks to decide what is better. So in summary+wireless-larger size, after using for more then a day I ended not liking the size...-side buttons are easy to click on accident with the tip of your thumb, front left side button is almost impossible to click-not as smooth to move as the G9-hard to move scroll wheel-desktop clutter (hockey fans will like it)-left side of the mouse feel award where your pinkie finger is located, not smooth</review>

<review id="5246">I have used Braun for over 35 years but this product coming out at 21st Century is the WORST! I am very disappointed with this product which comes with a big price tag. I have a sensitive skin and after each use my skin gets extremely irritated and bumpy that I have to apply Hydrocortisone cream to soothe it. The trimmer is worthless and does not do the job. I have decided to go back to razors because I can shave with one stroke and I do not have to pass the shaver on and on many times and burn my skin with the heat. Adding salt to injury I have to use the Braun liquid to clean it each time with additional cost. I would NOT recommend this shaver to anyone. If you are able to test it before buying do it otherwise, either buy a cheaper one or just use the razor.</review>

<review id="5247">One of the main points of this very repetitive video is this: "Your thoughts cause your feelings". This is nothing new. It's one of the basic ideas of cognitive behavioral therapy. There's nothing magical about it. What this movie does is add a magical touch to it, and say that you can magically attract health and material posessions by your thoughts. It claims that it will happen every single time, including curing fata illnesses. Obviously if I wish I had a $4.5 million dollar mansion - like one of the guys in the movie says he has - won't just make it happen, or if I get cancer, I won't be able to magically heal myself. These teachings are like the prosperity gospel and will inevitably make people feel bad because they don't get everything they wish for and they think it must be their own fault because they've done something wrong. Positive thinking does make you feel better, but the teachings of this movie are pure pseudoscience. The movie even claims that all terminal illness are caused by stress. Don't waste your money on it. The only people whose lives will prosper thanks to the movie are the filmmakers.</review>

I've been a Microsoft fan for a long time but needless to say, I've never been as disappointed with any software upgrade as I was with this one.  Everything takes at least 3 times as long, it takes forever to get used to, and simple commands such as "word count" take forever to find.

<review id="5252">I went to Frys to buy Turbotax and was amazed at the price increase from last year, even with the economy the way it is.  Amazon pricing is better so I checked it out -- much better price here but much higher than last year.  And Tax-cut missed their opportunity to clobber Turbotax.  They tracked the higher prices like gas-stations do.  Shame on both companies.  I am going to print out the free forms from irs.gov and do it the older, harder way.  I'd even rather pay an accountant who actually does work than a software company that tweaks their product for minor law changes and presses out a million CD's at $40 + each.  Ridiculous!</review>

<review id="5258">I loved Twilight. Is the book full of substance and superb writing? No. Is it an easy read, guilty pleasure, and a good escape from reality when you need it? Yes. New Moon and Eclipse fit right under these categories as well. But as I started reading Breaking Dawn, I felt like I was reading more of a trashy romance novel you find at your grocers check out. (I saw an interview with Robert Pattinson and he felt like Meyers was writing these books as if she were living through Bella, so this immediately made complete sense to me.) It felt so cheesy. I felt as if the book was really about nothing more and concluded with Bella and Edward's over the top sex life and 'yearning' for each other. Kind of as if Meyers were publishing her own fantasy for all the world to read, as Pattinson put it. Then it made me think of all the 12 year olds reading this material. (If I had a daughter around that age I'm not sure if I'd be too comfortable with her reading this installment.) Everything felt rushed and yet too lengthy all at the same time. I'm not too sure if I'm excited about her supposed 5th installment 'Midnight Sun'.</review>

<review id="5261">Very disappointing. I found it boring and had a hard time sitting through the whole thing. The basic plot may have some content and a hint of morality with its warnings about trashing planet earth, but it comes through as a slow moving sequence of images with no meaningful dialogue.

<review id="5264">Someone told me that Stephenie Meyer wrote Twilight thinking it was a one-book deal. With the great feedback, however, she decided to write more. New Moon and Eclipse followed Twilight, and they were just as gripping as the novel that preceded them. However, she created conflicts in these two novels-- the main one being bella's desire for both edward (her vampire boyfriend) and jacob black (her werewolf best friend who was there for her when edward left), and after reading Breaking Dawn, I've come to the conclusion that she should have gone with her gut and stopped at Twilight-- why? because she created a mess in New Moon and Eclipse that she didn't clean up creatively in Breaking Dawn. Meyer didn't end her book like an experienced writer. Instead she finished it off like a 5th grader who writes a scary story and at the end has the protagonist wake up from what was just a bad dream. Everything is perfect at the end, and after finishing the book, one feels hollow. 760 pages wasted building up to a climax that never comes. The absence of creativity wasn't BD's only problem. What readers love about the Twilight, NM, and Eclipse is that the story feels real. Even though we know vampires and werewolves don't exist, Meyer was able to make it seem plausible. There was nothing too weird going on. It was a teenage story with a nice twist. However, Breaking Dawn is the dark and twisted vampire romance novel that girls clad in black would pick up from a dusty bookshelf. After Part One we want to put the book down, because we realize the innocence is completely gone. Luckily, though, Jacob Black takes up the story, and we feel sane again. He shares our point of view-- that the stuff going on around him is extremely bizarre. Sadly, we lose Jacob when he imprints on Nessie, the demon child that Meyer tries to paint as an angel after she kills bella in the birthing process. Finally bella becomes a vampire, and everything we came to know and love in the first three novels is gone. We miss Bella's humanity-- her clumsiness and normalcy in the midst of the supernatural; we miss jake's intense devotion to Bella and his humorous conflicts with edward (I almost puked when Edward called Jake his "son"); we miss the petty high school buddies-- Mike Newton, Angela, Jess, etc; and we miss the action that never arrives. The Volturi come . . . and then they leave. In her other novels, Meyer always flirts with being cheesy, but the plot is so enticing that the reader can enjoy edward's and bella's proclamations of love for eachother. In Breaking Dawn, however, we quickly become sick of the two lovebirds and happily welcome Jake's cynicism in Part Two. His disgust with Bella's pregnacny mirrors ours. The truth is, we lost Bella before she turned into a vampire, and Jake is the only person left we can relate to. He is human (despite his ability to phase into a wolf). Then Meyer takes away Jake, too, forcing him into fantasy world with the stupid concept of imprinting.  And so Breaking Dawn left me wondering if Meyer even wrote it, because it had none of the elements of the other novels.Despite Meyer's sappy and peachy ending, my reaction to Breaking Dawn was sadness. Now I can't even reread the other three books without remembering how badly the saga was ended.</review>

<review id="5265">I mainly wanted to see this movie because of the location--I live in Raleigh, NC and the Outerbanks is truly one of the most beautiful places on this earth.  However, the beauty of the location was overshadowed by the sheer awfulness of this movie.  Predictable, schmatlzy, and just plain bad--I was p.o'ed that I wasted 1 hr 36 minutes of my life watching this crappy movie.  I expected more from Lane and Geer, both seasoned actors. Admittedly, I'm not the demographic this movie targets, but come on, who could really believe this crap?  Just say no and skip this one.</review>

<review id="5266">This device has worked terribly for me. I purchased to so I can have my vast array of HID's connected to my computer at once (HID stands for Human Interface Device such as a mouse, keyboard, tablet etc.) I was going to leave it under my desk out of sight leaving my desk area clean an neat, so much for that plan.The device doesn't "see" all the devices connected to it. I often times have to plug a device into it 3 or 4 times before it works. Worst of all this happens every time my computer is powered off and then back on. So another words I had to fish under my desk and unplug and plug everything back into it. This completely defeats the purpose of a hub in my situation. The whole reason I purchased it was so that I could have all my devices plugged in at once and not need to mess with any cables when I want to use them (compared to swaping out what devices I had conected). Now I have it on top of my desk with 7 ugly USB cables plugged into it, so that I can unplug and re-plug them in when I need to force the device to see whats conected to it.My suggestion is don't touch this device for the life of you. If you have a computer with PCI of any type find a USB expansion card instead. I decided to go with the hub rout due to the high cost of PCI express USB expansion cards and the fact none of the devices I was plugging into this require much bandwidth (they are all HIDs) and in the end I regret every penny that was wasted on this terrible product.</review>

<review id="5267">I had a D-Link Wired Gigabit / Wireless 108G gaming router, I had no issues at all with it, it performed perfectly.   Recently I got an ASUS 1000H and wanted to update to a Wired Gigabit / Wireless n router and picked this one.  I never experienced the following issues with my previous router:1) It didn't connect smoothly to my modem, but after I restarted both a couple of times it connected.2) The router hanged in the first hour around 4 times, I had no clue whether it's the network, the laptop, my wired PC or the Modem and troubleshooting concluded it's the router.   3) I upgraded to the latest firmware as of Nov 2008, still tons of issues, it works after I reboot cleanly for 5 mins or so, then wireless connections keep falling very frequently especially if I'm using more than 1 wireless or wired connection, also my PS3 and Vonage were not performing as well as before.    4) At best my Asus Wireless n got me a 65MB compared to 54MB for my old g card, but the signal faded very quickly to 34MB.  But as it crashes like 10 times within 2 hours it's not worth it.   Switched everything to G and still it drops the connection with any mid / heavy wireless usage pattern.     5) Used back my old router and everything working like a charm, I'm returning this now....   likely those who like it have a single connection or not using /n  in this case I advice them to save the money and go for a different router.</review>

<review id="5268">the software loading program has problems on a pc, but remarkably, though i asked the staff of amazon repeatedly if the router was mac compatible & could be loaded with a macintosh, the software could only be used on mac 9 software that's at least four or five years old, and only after downloading a program from another unrelated website. netgear ALSO charges for their customer service. don't buy this product if you use mac primarily.</review>

<review id="5269">When Season 1 came out, I watched the first three episodes. After that, I lost interest. Why? This is not my type of sci-fi, where a lot of the plot is pure conflicting psychological themes with little basis of human reality. No, I was not expecting a remake of the first BG, but I also was not expecting Psycho in Space realm either.In reading the other reviews, I am fascinated by the high ratings and interests. The disappointment for me is that very little (if any) of the reviews extend BG with other sci-fi novels, like from Raymond Bradbury or Arthur C. Clark, where BG's plots could have built on other famous sci-fi themes but made them better (or at least more interesting in a BG's sort of way). I'm glad that BG does have a large following, and if you have never watched BG, I recommend viewing at least the first three episodes before purchasing any BG DVDs, just to make sure you like the series.</review>

<review id="5270">I tried one at my friends place and I thought it was cool at first until I did some research and put some serious thinking into this.First off, this system works by measuring the change in voltage from the reading on one node to the other. Given that, consider these facts1) the system can't account for a difference in electrical impedance between different types of skin2) it will give you different results if your overly hydrated or dehydrated3) it is well known that electricity takes the route with the least resistance. so unless somehow that route goes up your leg through each of your arms, and back down your body, this thing can only measure the body fat between each of your legs.4) i scored a 5% on the calipers... which has a pretty high margin of error... but not so bad that i would actually have a 15% body fat composition, which is what this thing rated me at.</review>

<review id="5272">We bought these for each of our kids' room.  They were okay for a couple of months, but they all started shorting out--the sounds come in and out, at varying volumes from zero to VERY LOUD!  My oldest child told me that it was actually waking her up.  The same seems to happen with our baby.  I've heard all of the machines do this.  And, they don't start the first time I turn them on.  I have to turn it on twice to get sounds.  It's worse than having no sleep machines!</review>

<review id="5273">This review is from: Gone with the Wind (DVD)      Wonderful movie, but below average DVD.  When one buys a DVD they not only want to see the movie, but a bunch of little extras too.

<review id="5275">I purchased one of these drives in April 2008 for storage of a vast photo library.  In mid-August it crashed.  I contacted G-Tech (a whole adventure in itself with no 800 number and 15-20 minutes wait time for a representative).  I returned the original device with instructions to retrieve the files.  Three weeks later a new drive arrives but no files.  Then the real odyssey begins.  Three unanswered emails led to two phone calls only to find out that they did not retrieve the files but would try to locate the bad device so that they could get the files.  Five days later I am informed that the device has been found and they have the files.  This from their rep, one Miguel Huerta.  Two more weeks of waiting, no files.  After four unanswered emails to Mr. Huerta I call again to speak to a manager.  Three days later I am informed that they were unable to retrieve the original files.  They could, however, send the original drive to an outside recovery company (of course, for a hefty fee). By now it is the second week of October.   The fact is that I am out over 10,000 images and I needed some long breathing sessions to release my frustration at such irresponsible customer service.</review>

<review id="5276">I really wanted to love this machine- it brews coffee SO fast- fast enough to make serving multiple cups no issue, the water temp is perfect, there are so many flavors I was excited about. But the coffee was WEAK. How can you afford to pay $150 and extra money for pods when the coffee isn't any good? Even the bold flavors! It's NOT a roast issue! You should be able to get a medium roasted coffee that's not the color of tea (even on the smallest size setting)- it reminds me of coffee from Denny's. And I'm really not a coffee snob either- my favorite brand is folgers. But this doesn't even come close to an avg. cup of folgers!I'm sad and confused! Is it just meeee?</review>

<review id="5277">I have had this router for 6 months (I purchased it at Target). To start with it was a serious bear to set up. Another reviewer posted the steps to alleviate the IP DNS issues so I won't reiterate, I would just like to comment that the process is a pain, and is magnified if you actually need to open a port and/or set up a static IP. You start to feel like you need an A.S. in computer networking if you have more than one computer AND need to open ports and set up a Static IP -.-. I have 2 XBOX 360's, a PS3, and two laptops....getting my NAT settings set correctly nearly cost me my marriage 0.0. Assuming you get it up and running, it works well....for awhile. Then you start to experience the joy of its garbage...err "recycled" hardware. You start to dance the dance of the moron. Update firmware, call tech support where they will tell you to unplug it for two mins....then when that doesn't work....to unplug it again for two mins.....rinse repeat until you realize that the "special" kid on the other end of the phone can barely spell router and he certainly does not have the knowledge to help you fix yours. If the miracle of miracles occurs and you get it up and running, you start a new level of hell. The signal is sketchy, and that's being generous. I have put the thing on my head (Yes, I was THAT frustrated >: ( ) and still only had minimal signal. Even better, when I DO have signal, that does not mean I have internet. I cannot count the number of times I have just dragged the laptop into the other room and connected directly. Nothing quite like trying to focus while freezing your butt off on the kitchen floor tile.I like to have something positive to say about everything...so....uhm, it did not set my house on fire. It was fun to smash to tiny little bits with the hammer too >^^&lt; (yes, I really did and frankly, I should have done it sooner).For all that is good and decent on this planet DON'T BUY THIS THING!!!!!!</review>

<review id="5278">I just placed an order for these as part of a larger order.  When I looked at my shopping cart I saw that not only does this item not qualify for SuperSaver shipping, but it is back ordered into April (over a month), and the shipping charges are over $11.00 on a $7.99 item.

<review id="5279">I was really disappointed with this sharpener. I read the directions prior to use and decided to sharpen my knives. When I was done, I think my knives were sharper before I sharpened them. I used my sharpening steel to put the sharp edge back on them. The sharpener is back in the box and in storage in the garage. I'll do it by hand for now on. Save your money.</review>

<review id="5280">First the 75ml container is a sad thing to see $20 fly out the window for.  Especially when you get it home and read that it will likely cost you hundrreds of dollars before your situation is settled depending on the size of (and contents) our house.  In order to fulfill the requirements on the first $20 bottle of stink you have got to spend more money because you only have so little not enough to do the job ..... I did notice a change while I used it for the first four to five days - My cat was marking more and more .... more than ever before .... for me the $20 was a sad experiment and educational in its outcome.  I would not recommend this product.</review>

<review id="5281">I feel the same way the other reviewers do in the sense that this sheet is not worth the price.  It is a very thin sheet and I do not feel it is soft to the touch.

<review id="5282">I consider myself above average in computer-related knowledge.  I have been struggling to get the WRT54G and the linksys PCI adapter card - WMP54G -  to work for three months.  One day it works, the next day it suddenly doesn't.  It all starts once you start trying to figure out and use the various security features.  Then it's all downhill.  Sometimes I get a good signal, sometimes I don't.  The distance from router to receiving computer is less than 100 feet, with three thin walls in between.  I haven't been able to get it up and running for the past 6 weeks (although I have tried everything - reinstall, reconfigure, re-set settings, disable zone alarm firewall, disable norton antivirus, etc.) The Linksys written instructions are worthless.  Their tech support is in India and they are difficult to understand, often rude and ultimately don't help you solve the problem (and only after you wait eons before you get to speak to an actual human.) If you don't care about security, you might be able to get the network to work. But if you try to set up and utilize any security feature, you'll run into problems and you'll be stuck like I have been.  I have tried reinstalling the adapter card three times, re-set the setting on the rourter but nothing.  I have checked that the channels are the same on both the router and receiving computer, that the SSIDs are the same on both, etc. etc. but no go.  After I bought this Linksys hardware, my friends warned me this would happen.  I have given up and am returning it.  Trust me.  Don't waste your time and energy - buy your networking hardware from another manufacturer.  I am going to.</review>

<review id="5284">I don't want to include any spoilers, but much of my disappointment with the book has been mentioned in other reviews. Overall, the transition of the main characters was too quick and unbelievable. Loose ends were conveniently dealt with which was not fair to the characters that I have grown to love in the first three books. Perhaps the readers that give this book five stars wanted a completely happy ending, no matter how unbelievable.</review>

<review id="5286">Reading all the glowing reviews, I guess I must be out of luck. I bought my first Omron HJ-112 a few years ago. It never worked. If you walk for several minutes, it will start working at some point, but if you are the kind of person who walks around the house or the office, then sits down, then walks again and tries to keep track of how much she walked during the day, this is completely useless. After a few frustrating months with my first Omron pedometer, I dropped it and it broke. I was undecided, but then I decided to give the Omron another chance, thinking that so many reviewers cannot go wrong, and if my first one was defective at least the new one *had* to be good. Well: it is a mystery to me why all these people love the Omron. The second one is a piece of junk, just like the first one. It does not matter how you set it (clip, belt, pocket, hanging...), there is no *right* way to make it work. Distance from my car (in an assigned parking spot) and my office ranges between 200 and 800 steps. It is completely random, and at the end of the day I always wonder how much I *really* walked, and why on earth I spent money on this thing. Day after day of frustration. Spare yourself and look elsewhere.</review>

<review id="5289">I bought this camera as I had fallen in love with the form factor and the fact that it records on SD cards.I am a professional camera and Steadicam operator for a prime time network TV series. I was expecting a camera that had good quality, but did not have higher expectations, knowing that it is a sub 1000 dollars camera.It did surprise me on how well it was built, how the menus were easy, yet highly customizable.I loved the feel in my hands, the dock, pretty much all about it, including the good (but not fantastic) picture quality,  except the image stabilization.That unfortunately, was unacceptable. I could not get a shot without jerks and shakes that were excessive when played back on my 50" plasma. Maybe if you watch it on a small tv set, it will be OK, but for me it wasn't and I had to return it. I was very sad to do so, as I really liked the Camera, maybe in the future they will figure it out...</review>

<review id="5290">I have been using Paperport software for about 8 years.  The software has always been easy to use and usually problem free.  Tipically if you run into a problem it will be at initial install.  They you uninstall, run the removal program from their web site, and reinstall.  All should go well.  Software has always done well for me until Version 11.  Maybe they will fix it.  I have Version 11 for Vista on my Vista home premium comuter and it is slow, very slow.  It also locks up frequently on older files that I have created in the past with Paperport.  Such as two or three year old files.  This should not be. Tech support is about the worse I have seen anywhere.  You get one, only one free tech support call, then they cost.  Even email is $9.95 per incident.I would wait a while on version 11, maybe they will fix it,  I am using it right now out of necessity.</review>

<review id="5294">Amazon.com should be ASHAMED.  I'm sorry.  I was a huge amazon.com fan until I needed to return this Braun Series 7 Top-of-the-line shaver "new and unopened" due to receiving an identical one as a gift.  The invoice says "Returns are easy".  When I bring up the purchase on the website it says "Click here for returns".  BUT you CAN'T return it.  No matter what.  You trustingly click that purchase button and you're STUCK WITH IT!  Certainly, used personal items can't be returned for obvious health reasons.  But a new, unopened product this expensive with tamper proof packaging what has never been used that they won't even acknowledge is shameful and unacceptable.  No warning on the invoice.  No notice on your confirmation page before you purchase.  Just a big fat expensive suprise!  Anywhere else I checked said they'd gladly accept the return.  Amazon won't.  No reasoning, no explanation.  Just sorry you're out of luck.  Thow it out or give it away, but don't look at us. Unless you are brave or omniscient and know that you will never ever need to return it to amazon, buy it ANYWHERE ELSE BUT here at Amazon.com.Sorry Braun for the 1 star.  I wish I could have given even less stars but it's not your fault.  Your Braun Series 7 - 790cc Pulsonic Shaver is fantastic and deserves 3.5 - 4 stars (the is no razor that shaves as close as a blade so none are perfect and none deserve 5 stars--plus your alcohol based cleaning system that will run at least $75/year to use is overpriced and a rip off.  Make it cheaper, especially after charging $290 for the razor.  At least printer manufacturers realize they are ripping you off for the ink cartridges and practically give away their printers to rope you into spending money endlessly on their refills.  The shaver works amazingly well compared to many others I've used, it's built well so far, and is easy to use.  The cleaner does keep it clean and hygenic.  It deserves 4 stars, minus 1/2 to 1 for the cleaner refill ripoff ($6-7/mos for $0.50 worth of rubbing alcohol?, which evaporates even if you don't use it daily) with it's unsitely cleaning unit that has to sit on your countertop forever due to the evaporating rubbing alcohol.  The shaver is terrific though.  Buy one, enjoy it, just DON'T BUY IT FROM AMAZON no matter what you do because they WILL NOT have anything to do with returning it for ANY reason, whatsoever, no matter what!  The web site actually (literally) tells you to throw it away if you try to return it and when you email amazon.com they tell you to give it to someone else as a gift (verbatim).  So when you're about to drop $200-$300 dollars on this razor, spend it elsewhere where there is actual service and respect for you.  Any other store will gladly accept it new and unopened (just as amazon promises but won't) if you decide you don't want it, don't need it, have two, etc. and refund you in full.  Amazon WON'T.  You are STUCK WITH IT no matter what happens.  It's too expensive of an item to take the risk with amazon...unless you have friends who are used to $250 gifts or a deserving trash man.Caveat Emptor:  BUYER BEWARE!!!!!  Don't say I didn't warn you.Update 12/13/08:After a second email to Amazon.com I received a suprising email back that they were going to fully refund my money for the item and did apologize.  I can't tell you how suprised I am or how appreciative but don't count on this in the future.  Don't expect to be able to return the shaver, but thank you Amazon for making right.  My faith is restored, but future buyers beware and be sure before purchasing.  Thank you amazon.</review>

<review id="5295">I bought this for $30 from the on campus apple store but after using this for 1 week, I started hating myself for buying such a crappy software. One of the problems with MS office is that it starts hogging resources as soon as you start it and sometimes I have found that the outputted documents are not compatible with MS office 2004 on Windows (even when you ask Office 2008 to generate 2004 compatible documents). Before buying office mac, I used open office and I still feel that open office is better than this office-mac.</review>

<review id="5296">I bought this router becasue it was supposed to be the best, everybody used them. I bought mine and the set up was a nightmare.

<review id="5298">I purchased this item approximately 2 years ago. It is a nice size and design; however, all I ever get out of it is SLOP. The container never seems to get cold enough to make a even a semi-solid product. This is not due to lack of sufficient time in the freezer because I keep the container low in a deep freezer. I have followed several of the recipes from the  recipe book included in the box with NO SUCCESS. It always ends up going to the cats. Therefore, I definitely advise not wasting your time and money on this item.I have several other kitchen appliances made by Cuisinart that I have been extremely satisfied with, but this purchase did not hold up to my previous high expectations of Cuisinart.</review>

<review id="5299">This past Monday, I purchased an HJ-720ITC Pedometer. I have to say that I've owned other pedometers, and am quite impressed with the accuracy of the unit and all of its features. The unit gives really great feedback and contains a lot of useful information. I also really like the Omron Health Management software, too. I like being able to keep a record of my progress. Why one star, then? Because this morning, I got up and was getting ready to go out for a walk, when I was disappointed to discover that the unit had slipped off my belt some time last night and was gone. I wasn't surprised, really. This is not the first time in the last five days that this has happened. I'm a guy whose pockets have a lot of competition between bills, change, keys, a cell phone, an iPod, various papers, and a wallet. Since I'm not about to wear the thing around my neck like a talisman, don't have much room in my pockets, and don't always carry a bag, the only practical place for it is on my belt. The belt clip that came with the HJ-720ITC was just useless, however. The first day, it slipped off entirely. I didn't discover it for a half hour and went running through the parking lot at work to find it. A couple of other times, I heard it hit the ground while I was reaching for something in one of my other pockets. I got to the point where I was compulsively checking every few minutes to see if the unit was still there. This morning, I was disappointed, but not surprised when I discovered it missing. After the first few times of having it slip off my belt, I knew it was just a matter of time before the unit would be gone. And it's such an incredible shame. It is otherwise so well thought out and designed and does its job so incredibly well. It is, however, nothing short of negligent for the Omron engineers to give so little thought to the clip on a device that's designed to be carried around! Today, people are used to throw away electronics, and I suspect after six months or a year, if the unit had failed, I would have eagerly ponied up another fifty bucks for another one. But after five days? I just feel ripped off. I've complained to the company, but won't be demanding a replacement. What good would it do? In five more days, it will likely be gone too. If the folks at Omron are listening, what I'd really like is for the quality and thought that went into creating the pedometer itself to be extended to clip. Until then, however, I can only tell potential customers to just stay away from this nice unit held in place by a shoddy piece of junk.</review>

<review id="5301">These beds will not hold up to English bulldogs. As far as the dogs are concerned they like them. After about three months they had chewed holes in them and had to be replaced.

<review id="5302">Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Let me explain the latter.  It'll copy "most" of my files but then freeze at 10 seconds left or 5 seconds left and then error out.

Consider that I am frustrated enough to log onto my account at Amazon and post this negative review.  Stick with the Sandisk Cruzer.</review>

<review id="5303">I'm not happy. I have used Sonicare toothbrushes ever since they were invented. At first there was only one model. When it wore out after many years I replaced it with a one just like it. When the company was sold to Phillips they started making several different models. When I recently had to replace my second one(after many years) I still bought the basic, most economical model. I have no hopes that my new one will last 1/2 as long as the old ones. Every time I use it it has leaked water into the brush handle and I have to dump it out. It seems very flimsy.</review>

<review id="5304">I was so excited about this product, especially since it received so many positive reviews. The first problem is, it takes way too long. After the initiail brewing, it continues to drip for several minutes, so your coffee will start to cool off before the mug is ready to be pulled away. Second, the coffee grounds get all over the place. Today, I even put in less grounds to see what happened, and it is still all over the inside of the machine, even where the water goes, making for a tedious cleaning process each time. And yes, there are grounds in my cup of coffee. This was a complete waste of money.</review>

<review id="5305">I have been using Quicken since the mid 1990s. It used to be great, and the 2003 version worked fine, but they made me upgrade to Quicken 2008 to continue using BillPay. The new version of Quicken was terrible, and I thought at least they would fix the most obvious bugs in the 2009 version. But no. It's terrible.It's slow to load, slow to record transactions, and the user interface INTERFERES with seeing entries in register mode. If I can find another personal accounting package that will work with my banks and credit card companies, I will switch and never go back to Quicken. I will NOT upgrade Quicken, again.</review>

<review id="5309">This review is from: Gone with the Wind (DVD)      We don't need reviews on how good or bad the movie was.  It's been around since 1939.  People have made up their minds about it.  However, we do want to know about the technical aspects of the disc and the format.  I have  ordered this disc but in checking the technical information I was apalled  to see that the aspect ratio is 1.33 to 1.  Is that true?  Mon Dieu!  Then  why buy this disc? That's why I've given it only one star.  I'll change it  if the actual format is greater.</review>

<review id="5310">I will try watching this movie one more time but I could only make it through the first half hour or so before turning off the DVD player. It reminded too much of Moulin Rouge which was so bad it was funny.Australia wasn't quite that bad, it wasn't funny what little I saw of it, but it wasn't all that good either. Part of the problem, at least for me, was following the plot. It seemed to jump around a lot, and there were a lot of scenes that made we wonder why they were there, but there they were.A memorable scene was Lady Ashley learning how to herd cattle. Of course she learned to ride in England before moving to Australia. From what little I saw of Australia could hardly fall into the grand, epic movies from the 50s and 60s either. There was no Charlton Heston or Elizabeth Taylor in this movie. The actors were good but not good enough as the epic actors of 50 years ago.The cinematography was well done and using the young character to move the storyline along was a nice touch.</review>

<review id="5312">!!!SPOILER!!!I finished the book and I don't know if I liked it or not yet, but here are some thoughts: *Book One of Breaking Dawn: Perfect and lovely. This felt like the book I was waiting for, the book that fit in nicely with the series. I truly, truly enjoyed this section very much. *Book Two: This section was absurd to me. I saw the pregnancy thing coming from a mile away and at first I was amused. But then she started dying, there was the Rosalie thing and the Edward self-loathing thing and it got to be a bit weird. Well, a lot weird. It didn't feel like Stephanie Meyer. It didn't feel like Bella and Edward. I am ALL for stories changing and characters evolving, but this was kind of crazy (to me, no offense to those that loved it). And she's just 18! It was just... not Twilight. But I guess that's the point. I hated that it was from Jacob's perspective at first, but I got over that. I even started to enjoy his POV. *Book three: This section was ok. There were ridiculous parts but also great parts, so it averages out to ok. I really loved the description of Bella as a newborn vampire. I liked her powers and her new life. It was cool. I saw the imprinting thing coming as soon as Bella got pregnant, so that wasn't a surprise. The baby... just so weird. The character itself was cool (but what and awful name!) I dunno, it just didn't seem to fit the book. She has a neat power and seemed cute, but I couldn't get over it. I couldn't get over the whole vampire parent at 18 thing. It felt out of place. And all the vampires coming at once and almost no fighting at the end... it was just weird. Again, it didn't seem right. I'm glad Edward and Bella got their happily ever after - especially because it felt like we kind of lost Edward after section one. But it all wrapped up way too neatly. And no battle... alas... Now, with all that said, Steph is the author, not me. She can take her book down any path she pleases. And I didn't HATE it. It's her series, her decision. And I still like her and I still love the first three books. Just can't shake the feeling of disappointment from this one. Oh well.</review>

<review id="5317">This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [HD DVD] (HD DVD)      I have not yet watched my DVD set but have heard wonderful things about it. People should know that in order to watch the HD DVD set they need to own a HD DVD Player.  I am sure that there are people that know this, whom are really Technology savy, but there are many of us who do not.  Since there was no info addressing this on the add, I bought it thinking it could play on my regular DVD player and that I could watch it on my HD flat screen.  As a result I had to return it and buy the regular DVD set.  Also, the first disc is a blue rray disc.  Make sure to find out if that first disc can play on an HDS DVD player, or if you need a DVD Player that is both HD & blue ray.</review>

<review id="5318">I've had a Linksys 802.11B for about  4 years without any issues but it was time to upgrade. I bought the WrT610N and hooked it up. I'm a Computer Engineer so I know what I am doing, but I had a heck of a time getting two HP laptops to connect to the network. Two other computers were not an issue. One laptop was Vista, the other XP. After about an hour messing with it, I called Linksys support and worked another hour on the phone with someone who did all the same things I did. I was then told a level two support person would have to call me and it could be up to 4 hours.I then worked on the laptop a little more an got it to work, however the range was terrible. I would get halfway up the stairs and it would just drop off. I then but everything back in the box, took it back to the store, bought a D-Link, hooked it up without any issues and  had great signal range.  Linksys support did call back, and I told them never mind.</review>

<review id="5320">I have used Quicken for longer than I can remember. The most recent version was 2004 Deluxe on a Windows XP Home SP3 PC, and I made a grievous mistake when I blindly chose to buy Quicken Deluxe 2009 for my new Windows Vista Ultimate SP1 PC. My condolences to the folks troubled by transaction download problems. Quicken Deluxe 2009 is an obnoxiously gimmicky and propagandized interface that foists numerous links to Intuit products and services which distract from the use of the software. It stubbornly ignores stored preferences. Its backup fails capriciously. It stores memorized transactions like a deranged hoarder. Quicken's technical support staff make long-maligned DMV clerks look like five-star waiters. If I am lucky enough to get through to a live (leaving definitions of life aside for now) chat agent, they eclipse the ability of teenagers to procrastinate, misunderstand and break away. Email support offers an equally courteous and misguided approach to problem resolution. Blame the Vista OS and reinstall the program after scrubbing the hard drive with a belt sander are the preferred responses, usually after deciding that my stated backup hard drive is a CD drive and my carefully worded questions are unworthy of direct response. This product and its service are disgraceful.</review>

<review id="5324">I've made it no secret to my friends, both in real life and over the internet, of my pure contempt for this series, and yet I read on. Was it because I was completely bewildered that a romance series had a thinly veiled abusive relationship and not enough characterization between the leads to fill a teaspoon? Or was it because beyond all that I was mildly interested in the plotline, and wanted to see how she would escape out of the corner she wrote herself into?I'm honestly unsure, but I can say that I had one of my queries answered. I've said it before and I'll repeat it here, her own limitations, forcing her to try and write a fairy tale romance that never was, would be the death of her work. She is completely dedicated to giving her characters everything while costing them nothing. She just doesn't comprehend the idea of literary sacrifice nor does she seem to grasp how when one has one's every wish, one can never be happy.Yes, the series contained mostly drivel but if she had spent the time and effort, a best-selling author should have, she could have mildly salvaged the series. Instead she attempted to turn out 700 pages in one year, and still make readable, a goal in which she failed. I think what shocks me the most, was that on some level I did hope she would finish the series that the fanfare for it deserved.She did escape from that corner however, by completely ignoring her own cannon and running amuck with what she ever had. I just have to say this, never have I come across an author who would so blatantly ignore rules they already placed in their world. Her total dedication to trying to please as many people as possible, and to trying to end the series using clues she already had that didn't add up, led her to practically assassinating characters that already where an inch form literary death.</review>

<review id="5325">The sound on the headphone is decent, especially considering the price.However, I've been trying to use these with Ventrilo and other voice-chat programs and the microphone is barely audible.  I've turned up all the microphone settings both in the system control panel and on my sound card's control panel without any luck.  No-one can understand what I am saying unless I really shout into the microphone and even then only occasionally.I tried to see if Logitech's website had any hints but they don't list this product on their site.  In fact, it looks like they're trying to pretend they never made this sorry excuse for a microphone headset.If you want to listen only, these are probably fine.  However, if you want to be able to use the microphone, you shouldn't consider this product.  Choose something where the company's website AT LEAST admits the product exists.</review>

<review id="5328">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)        The special effects are good, but it is still a bad movie.  This is just another end of the world movie.  The only different thing, is it has some goofy good robots.  The comedy in it falls flat.  The story has holes in it.  The police car robot disappears.  Most of the human characters are not needed in the movie.  Every character in the movie is dull, and has not been fleshed out.  If you like pointless action movies, then see this movie.  Otherwise don't waste your time.</review>

<review id="5329">This review is from: Eclipse Special Edition (The Twilight Saga) (Hardcover)      When I stumbled upon Twilight I thought had found a rare gem. Finally, something worth reading amidst the mediocre offering of late. It didn't even bother me that I am 30 and these books are marketed towards teens because Stephenie Meyer's writing style relates to just about anyone.I loved loved loved Twilight. The personalities of all the characters and the interactions between Bella and Edward were great. Bella's quirks and her clumsy moments had me laughing out loud. I finished Twilight in a couple of days and rushed out to buy New Moon. New Moon I thought was excellent and I credit the author for having the courage to be different. Yes it was a very hard book to read because it was all about Bella's agony over losing Edward but to me that further built upon how they were soul mates. I could also relate because who hasn't experienced the sheer desperation and pain of losing a loved on. I thought that New Moon went beyond just a mere continuation of the story and focused more on the character's feelings and solidified Bella's and Edwards love in preparation for Eclipse.Eclipse I'm so sad to say ruined the beauty and uniqueness of the first two books. What was once a beautiful story about true love facing insurmountable odds was turned into some bizarre, trite, ambiguous love triangle. The enduring love that I found between Bella and Edward in the first two books was absent and reduced into something that had to be worked out. Why does Bella have to be in love with Edward and Jacob? Did that add another dimension to the story that I missed because to me it was pointless, whinny, a bit disturbing, and basically destroyed the storyline. Moreover, no character or story development was present in this book. I'm still going to read Breaking Dawn to see how it ends and I really really hope that Stephenie Meyer doesn't let her loyal fans down. On another note, I read Stephenie Meyer's new book The Host and it is one of my absolute favorite books of all time. Read it in one sitting and I thought it was brilliant. A love triangle was present in that book as well so perhaps this is something that intrigues the author, however in The Host it worked. I'd also like to say that I am giving this 2 stars because although this book is a shadow of her first two books Stephenie Meyer's writing is still impeccable and draws you in no matter how bad or inane the storyline is.</review>

<review id="5330">I do not understand why Microsoft insists upon taking a perfectly good product and screwing up it beyond recognition. Microsoft Office 2003, in particular Word 2003 was perfectly fine. It did what you needed it to do and it did it simply. I just bought a new laptop and could not find my Office 2003 discs so I was forced to buy the 2007 version. I am very computer saavy and have been using the Office products for over ten years and I absolutely hate this new version. Nothing is where it used to be and things are difficult to locate. One should not have to read the manual to use a product that has been around for years. I can see tweaking a product but completely overhauling something just for the sake of doing it and forcing consumers to buy it is insane. They could have kept the basic layout of the program. But ohhhhhh no, Microsoft has to screw everything up given the opportunity. I can understand if you want to overhaul the product but still make the old product available for sale for those who enjoyed the older version. Do not think you are going to jump into using this product. Don't install it until you have plenty of time to read the manual and look for things. I am not a happy camper and if I had any other option to be able to type school papers I would but unfortunately Microsoft has a monopoloy on this sort of software and it is a shame. If you are happy with your current Office 2003, do NOT upgrade just for the sake of upgrading. This product is not an improvement.</review>

<review id="5334">It's my fault, I admit as much, but I'm still annoyed and feeling cheated. My primary reason for purchasing this drive was for automatic backup. I had been comparing several brands on multiple websites, finally settling on the WD drive. I read several reviews on varying WD external drives before selecting this drive as it had the basics I needed: USB, 1 TB of storage, and (I mistakenly assumed) automatic backup software. I made the purchase from Amazon.However, as I've now discovered, the WD Essential My Book drive lacks any backup software beyond a 30-day trial (the same trial available from[...]). The actual software costs an additional $30+ from Memeo and other backup companies. Most all other WD My Books contain the full, retail versions of the software.Why WD left it out of the Essential is a mystery to me, and I think this probably annoys me as much as anything. Like I said, I made the mistake of not noticing the difference between this drive and the other editions, but it still feels like sleezy business practices to me; as if including a thirty dollar piece of software with their product would have ruined the company.The backup software is nothing special, but was my number one reason for purchasing this drive. If you're in the market for a simple, easy and automated backup solution, this is NOT the product for you.And yes, I'm rating the drive out of pure anger. It's probably a five-star drive, but I'm too annoyed with WD to be fair at this point.</review>

<review id="5335">I like TaxCut software, and have used it for a few years, but I have the same complaint as other reviewers about not including the state e-file.   This is dishonest marketing on the part of H&R Block, because this year's version deceptively has the EXACT SAME NAME as last year's version.   It's essentially a back-door method of raising the price.   Many of TaxCut's buyers are probably part of a loyal user base, but some of that loyalty may be eroded when H&R Block pulls shenanigans like this.   Can't we please just have a good tax-prep program (like last year's TaxCut) that includes the entire cost up-front - no additional fees, no rebates, no anything?</review>

<review id="5336">If you own a G4 MAC do not buy this software!  It runs very, very slowly and if you leave any Office application open it will slow down all functions on your computer.  Apparently only good if you have the new intel MAC not designed to work on the older MACs.   Getting information from Microsoft is impossible and MACTOPIA.COM was of no help.  They apparently do not even recognize the problem. Use Open Office which is free.  It too will be slow but not as slow as the Microsoft product.</review>

<review id="5337">I found a deal on this router that was just too hard to pass up. After several rebates, (which haven't shown up yet, I might add,) this router (WGR614) and a PCI card (WG311) would only cost me about $10. Killer deal, right? Wrong.Sure, it was really easy to install, and it got up and running pretty quickly, but then I'd suddenly lose connectivity. I'd open up the list of available wireless networks, it would tell me that I'm still connected, but it just wouldn't allow me to connect to any sort of outside internet site. I'd disconnect from the network, and try to reconnect, thinking maybe renewing my connection would fix it. Nope. I'd have to take regular trips to my housemate's room (where the cable modem and router are located,) and reboot the router. This would happen every half hour or so.I attemped to reach Netgear "customer service," which is naturally a call center in India, and they steadfastly refused to help me until my product was registered. Ironically enough, to register your product, you have to visit their website, something that I couldn't do at the time. After that debacle, I purchased a LinkSys WRT54GS router, and connecting with my laptop, haven't had any issues with it. Connecting with my desktop (and the netgear PCI card), on the other hand, is another wonderful experience. It recognizes that there is a wireless network available, it is just incapable of connecting to it, in both encrypted and open modes. This has taught me one lesson, though. I'm never going to purchase another netgear product again.</review>

<review id="5341">The Sansa is NOT useful for TALKING AUDIO with Multiple Folders, especially my required Sorted Play Order.The Sansa brand is better used as a plan MUSIC ONLY Player * I bought the SanDisk Sansa m250 2 GB MP3 Player w FM to replace a Creative 1 GB MuVo Tx FM that had a detachable flash drive with built-in USB connector.  * My Creative cost $70 and lasted about 2 years.  I was able to use it as a regular detachable flash drive for data and running programs.  Apart from the easy data flash drive I liked the large number of settings that Creative had, particularly the fact that it sorted audio files by File Name and allowed me to select individual folders (copied over from my pc).Most of my audio are lessons and I need to play or repeat folders that are sorted by mp3 TAG using file name ... like Tony Robbin's motivational material or Vernon McGee's Thru the Bible CD Set. * I bought the Sansa thinking that I could just re-copy over my usual audio files and listen to them as before ... NOT the case.  Even though it's a good size drive for the price and requires the separate USB attachment, it won't allow the access of data or programs and I CAN'T listen to my audio files in SORTED file name order unless I use the SONG selection which just plays everything on the entire drive ... If I select by Artist or Album then the play order is by Title (and it may be a different jumbled order). Sansa should COPY the Creative brand usability features!!!* I'm going back and buying the cheaper model of the Creative MuVo MP3 Player with Detachable Flash Drive ... I can skip the FM Radio model.</review>

<review id="5342">I had used this product for several years without a problem. But this year, for some reason yet to be discovered, Deduction Pro 2008 will not function. After a two hour chat with tech support and completely disabling my PC's configuration files (at their direction) it is clear that I simply had a damaged or corrupted CD. The tech squad at H&R went so far as to suggest I might not have the basic speaker and monitor specs or enough hard drive space. IT AS AS IF THEY REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE POSSIBILITY THAT I HAD A CORRUPTED SOFTWARE PACKAGE. They kept grasping at silly straws and wasting their and my time in the process. And get this - customer support cannot send me a replacement!!! Instead, I have to request a refund and then repurchase the software.Later I found out that you can get Deduction Pro for FREE from H&R on line, and they make the con claim on the product box that it is a $19.95 value.It is no wonder that anger over US manufacturing and industry continues to grow. Whatever happened to TRUE customer service?</review>

<review id="5343">Zojirushi BBCCX20 Home Bakery Supreme Bread MachineI have had several automatic bread machines (ABMs) over the last 12 years and use them quite frequently. I have found the BBCCX20 to be the poorest ABM to date. Though it costs twice as much as most of its competitors, the ergonomics are poor. It has a window to observe the bread, but no light -- so I had to keep a flashlight handy to see the bread.  There is no breadpan handle. This makes it difficult to remove the bread, and occasionally results in minor but annoying burns when a mitt or pot holder slips.Kneading is not up to par with other ABMs. The preprogrammed cycle times are such that minor changes in environmental humidity make for very large differences in loaf size, bread density and crust development. I found myself making ever changing adjustments to recipe water volume with the seasons. While all ABMs require some seasonal humidity adjustment, the BBCCX20 cycles are overly sensitive and difficult to work around.One of the paddles and its breadpan post has worn out, and the machine no longer kneads dough. Even though the machine is still under warranty (11 months), it is not worth the effort and cost of sending the breadpan back to Zojirushi for repair or replacement. The quality of the dough and/or bread made by the Zojirushi is so poor, that I have to switch to a different brand of machine.</review>

<review id="5344">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      I was under the impression that the Hollywood writers strike just went into effect this week.  But apparently it has been ongoing for some time, as this movie appears to have been written by children in grade school, or perhaps adults who never attended grade school.Here's a brief example for those who can suspend disbelief until near the end:A gaggle of government official, top-secret scientist types all stand around looking grim, proclaiming that all modern technology (cars are specifically mentioned) were "reverse engineered" from a transformer robot that crashed here 10,000 years ago, and was found by the US Government "in 1934". (Ever notice that all alien ships crash in places where no one but the US Government knows about them?)  At any rate, the government proceeds to build Hoover Dam around this alien technology in order to conceal it from the public, who just wouldn't understand.  Of course, no one bothers to ask how thousands of men could build a concrete dam around a 200 foot high alien robot without ever catching a glimpse of it, reporting it to anyone else, or being slightly curious what it might be or why they are encapsulating it in concrete.Furthermore, someone who attended 4th grade should tell the writers that the automobile was being sold by Karl Benz in the 1880's.  Therefore, it most likely was not reverse engineered from anything found in 1934, alien or otherwise.  The suits also proclaim that space flight, lasers, etc were also "reverse engineered" from this stunning, ancient, alien robot technology.   Okay, whatever. Then, not 5 minutes later, the secret alien plot is revealed.  They've come to earth to steal our technology and use it to rule the universe.   Wait a freaking minute! They were building 200 foot high, space-traveling, supersonic, laser-equipped robots 10,000 years ago while humans herded goats through the desert, but now we've caught up, passed the aliens technologically and now they want to lift *our* technology?   Wonder what they hope to steal...the Tivo? Bottom line: if you desire even one iota of credibility in your entertainment, pass on this silly farce and buy a DVD made for an adult audience.</review>

<review id="5345">Unfortunately, all the features that are supposed to make this device stand-out, fall on their face.  The HDMI port is a joke.  I plugged this into two different model HDTVs (both 720p/1080i max resolution).  When you power it on (which takes about 30-45 seconds to initialize) the display color isn't correct.  In fact it's missing two of the color channels - RED and GREEN.I had to actually plug the included (non-standard) component adapter into the TV, turn the drive on (without HDMI plugged in), get into the menu, switch the drive's display settings to 720p. Then while leaving it on, plug in the HDMI cable and switch the input on the TV for it to display all the colors.  If you turned the drive off - or it froze and you had to reset it, you had to complete all those steps from the beginning.Also, the device tends to freeze - A LOT.  I had to reboot it by holding the power switch in the back so many times I lost count (it was over 10 times in one sitting).  If you do actually get it to play back an AVI DivX movie, don't hold your breath.  It completely froze 5 times with 5 different movies, all of which play fine on my Xbox360, Xbox (softmodded), and computer.  This device, though potentially the most useful device for storing and playing back a large library of ripped DVDs, doesn't even work like its manual and ads say it should.  On top of that Iomega decided to format the drive NTFS - which means you have to reformat it if you want to plug the USB into a Mac or Linux computer to start copying your library to it.Avoid this thing like the plague.  You can get a 500GB external drive, and a Philips upconverting DivX DVD player with HDMI and a USB port to plug a drive into for $40 less - and it works better than this piece of garbage.</review>

<review id="5347">Loved the way the maker looked and fit in our kitchen. Produced a great espresso and milk foamed wonderfully. My husband loves a extra short espresso, my mother-in-law a watery shot, and I a milky latte. We were absolutely delighted until until after only six months the upper house of the maker began leaking water out of the two front corners all over the counter top. What a mess! I contacted Ariete's customer service directly and they kindly asked me to send the machine to their service rep that they provided. I sent the machine off and it was returned still broken. I asked Ariete to kindly replace the machine and they left me high and dry with a broken machine. The price is not a six month price and shipping a espresso machine is not cheap. Ariete products should be avoided if you want to avoid headaches. This time we're trying a Rancilio Silvia, because it seems to be the highest rated on a variety of opinion forms.</review>

<review id="5348">I bought this slow cooker because my current one was both too small and ran too hot. I have found the temp settings on this cooker to be perfect. While others love the ability to brown their meat directly in this cooker by using the included diffuser, I didn't find it to work so great. The bottom of the pot is not flat. The middle is higher than the sides, so the oil runs to the corners.My biggest grip is that the stoneware top is fragile. While I was picking it up to stir the soup I was making, it accidentally slipped and chipped the top. It is still functional and it was my fault for letting the top fall against the pot, but I find this to be a problem. The impact was not very hard. I've never chipped any other covers to my other pots or pans. For the price, I'd hope for a cover made of less delicate material. Otherwise, the cooker does exactly what it is supposed to. Capacity is just as advertised. The dials are great. I love the timer and WARM setting. The handles are great. I just do not like the cover.I'm giving it two stars because it is so expensive. For the price, I'd expect a simple slow cooker to have no faults. I'd find a less costly, more rugged model if I could do it all over again. I may call the company and see if they're willing to give me a replacement cover. If so, I'll update this review.</review>

<review id="5349">I am not really all that crazy with emotional sappy dramas. It's probably because I am a young teen turning into an adult sooner or later. Maybe that's how I feel with movies like "Martian Child." They're just silly. And with the movie "Nights in Rodanthe," this film is just plain ridiculous."Nights in Rodanthe" tells the story of a divorced mother that runs an inn for 1 week and ends up falling in love with a guy. They soon bond and build in a relationship that soon comes to an end.Yeah, I would have to admit. These types of movies. They're cute, but they're just not my thing. Diane Lane has a bit of a loud voice and Richard Gere, I found him painfully annoying and quiet. Mostly annoying.</review>

<review id="5353">You would think that a bread machine with a timer option is meant to work without being watched every minute, but not this one.  The first time I used it, it jumped off the counter and crashed to the floor, broke and is now useless.  I can only imagine that it jumped around while it was kneading the dough (unlike the last machine I had, this one has only one paddle) and worked its way over the edge of counter. What poor engineering!</review>

<review id="5354">The Omron HBF-500 is not worth your money.  Get a good scale and a separate Omron HANDHELD body weight calculator.  I admit, the body weight scale is extremely accurate but the body fat percentage calculator is not.  That is why I gave it two stars instead of one star.So far, based on a seven-fold calipher test, the HANDHELD Omron device is really on target (plus or minus a tenth of a percentage). The integrated Tanya body weight and body fat scale reports a 4 percent deviation from the two aforementioned methods.  The Omron HBF-500 reports an almost 6 percent deviation from the first two aforementioned method.I have had professional testing for my resting metabolism.  For my body, the Omron HBF-500 under reported my resting metabolism by 600 calories.Overall, the only thing that is worth wild about this scale is the body weight scale.  Nothing else.  The extra gagets are not worth the money when the reports are inaccurate.</review>

<review id="5355">I bought this player because of it's numerous great features at a very appealing price.However, I can only give this product 2 stars because of all of the software/connection issues I keep encountering.  After two weeks of owning this product and attempting to load 6.5 Gb of my music, I have been completely unsuccessful for the following reasons:1.  The player locks up when connected via USB and I have to reset it.2.  The player constantly connects and disconnects via USB, not allowing me to stay connected long enough to transfer anything or syncronize through the provided software via drag and drop.3.  The player tells me it's out of space even though it has 4.5-5 Gb still available (this is when it usually locks up or disconnects).I do have the latest firmware and have followed the steps listed on Creative's site to correct errors, but nothing has helped.To be fair, this product does have some strong points as well:1.  The FM radio works great.2.  The SD card feature is nice to have.3.  What little music I have been able to hear out of it sounds very good.I am considering returning this product and buying something else, but I want to give it another week to see if it finally decides to cooperate.  As an FYI, I have encountered the exact same problems with Vista x64, Windows XP, and a Mac.</review>

<review id="5356">I've bought four of these with my friends, in the last 3 months.ALL of them have stopped to work. It just stops suddenly. The led on it wont light up anymore, it will no be recognized by windows anymore.Even thought Kingston gives you the 5 year warrant, it is really frustrating to have 4 (FOUR) braking in the first 3 months. Try other brands that give you UNLIMITED warrant, because they really believe in their product. Before buying this, take a look at other brands....</review>

<review id="5357">I foolishly decided to upgrade my 2007 version of Quicken to 2009 after being prompted by Quicken to do so. I figured the new version would potentially offer some improvements from the 2007 version, and specifically I was hoping that it would download my Vanguard ROTH IRA information correctly since my existing version never could tell the difference between a stock purchase and a cash transaction... I am fanatical about backing up my data, and so I have several copies of my Quicken file that are on an external drive, as well as one uploaded to my online data cache in case of a fire. Without these backups, installing Quicken 2009 would have ended in tragedy. Immediately after going through the update installation and first running the program, I knew there was a real issue. Almost all of my data was jumbled, with a total loss of historical data (including uploaded images of bank statements, canceled checks, etc). The program was sluggish, and when I ran the download function, nothing but my bank transactions and one of my credit cards downloaded. I double checked passwords and they were correct. The download failed again and every subsequent attempt I made failed as well. I decided to start with a clean slate and deleted all Quicken files and registry entries, rebooted, and ran the installer again. This time the program did convert my old data file correctly and my historical data was intact. However, the program still doesn't import my ROTH IRA transactions correctly, and the new layout is very poorly designed and frustrating to use. I use QuickBooks non-profit at work every day, and the differences between Quicken and their professional software seem to increase with ever permutation of Quicken. They have gone for a reductionist philosophy of design, and my making everything simplistic, have further eroded my ability to easily generate reports, track spending across categories, etc... Overall this is an unnecessary update that includes nothing of substantial value. Worse, the new interface is poor and I find myself wishing for my 2007 version which I am seriously considering re-installing. Issues with the corruption of my data file suggest that the program has major bugs. I cannot recommend the program to anyone except those who are forced to upgrade (Users of 2006 and older versions of Quicken). If you do decided to upgrade, I strongly recommend you back up your data file to an external location before making the upgrade in case Quicken 2009 eats your data file. I also advise you to do an uninstall of the older version before installing the new version.</review>

<review id="5358">I honestly cannot figure out why Microsoft cannot make software that works. I'm specifically going to complain about Powerpoint 2008 (and the 2004 version), since that is the product I really use. (I use it to view powerpoint lectures in medical school; they are about 80 slides each with an average of maybe .3-.5 pictures per slide.) By the way, I'm running it on a macbook with a 2.16Ghz Core 2 Duo with Leopard 10.5.6, Firefox and Mail open usually. Oh, and I'm using PP2008 version 12.1.5, the latest version as of this review, just in case your thinking "update the program, dummy."2004: Slow. I understood the reason for this to be the fact that 2004 was still coded for the pre-intel processors, so the Rosetta technology had to convert everything to intel code first. Makes sense. Biggest complaint here was that when the View option was set to "Fit" the program would go crazy and (sometimes) crash if one character fell outside the current slide. When I would fix the formatting issue (which is common in user-generated powerpoints; I feel Microsoft should be appropriately prepared for this after at least 8 years) the problem would resolve. This is very annoying since I deal with 5 powerpoints a day, each have this problem at least once.2008: I bought this because I thought it would be faster. Boy was I wrong. It's just slower in different ways. PP2004 would take a few seconds to switch slides and sometimes get stuck in the process. PP2008 doesn't have this problem, but for some reason it takes 8 seconds to save a file, and the autosave function itself is retarded. If the powerpoint is open but save (i.e. there is no dot on the red "close" button), and you leave it alone and saved for longer than the autosave interval, the first time you try to click on something like a text box or a picture, even if you don't change anything, is autosaves. So, everytime you wait a while and then click on something, you have to wait 8 seconds before you can do anything. THIS IS ANNOYING ENOUGH TO MAKE ME TURN OFF AUTOSAVE-->VERY DANGEROUS. If that were not enough, take this. There is about a .5 second lag on EVERY. SINGLE. CHARACTER. YOU. TYPE. It doesn't sound like much but you probably know how annoying it can be to wait for a string of text to catch up with you. Office 2004 did this occasionally, not continuously. There are a few good thing about Office2008, though. The formatting problem mentioned above seems to be gone. Also, the detachable menus that I found so annoying in 2004 are now embedded within each open window.So why did I write this review? It's incomplete and admittedly is a little imbalanced since I'm currently using it and am obviously frustrated. The answer is simple: to vent. I mean, if you need office, you need office. But hopefully I may save someone who has 2004 the grief of upgrading to a different kind of crappy. Honestly, the reason I upgraded to 2008 from 2004 was that I thought it was faster. It's not.</review>

<review id="5360">Dear Intuit:I like your Turbo Tax product, and I want to use it.  However, charging more for much less goes against any principle of common sense.  Of course, this is not the first hair-brained scheme cooked up by the bean counters at Intuit (Remember the boondoggle of product activation?  It took me 3 years before I forgave Turbo Tax/Intuit for that one and bought their software again)Intuit, no reasonable person minds a couple dollar increase in the price of tax software every year.  People understand that things get more expensive.  However, such a large price increase while taking away much of the functionality of the software........it's simply rediculous.  Any consumer can and will see this, and Intuit will have priced themselves out of the market.  Just give us unrestricted, completely functioning software at a reasonable price, and the customers will come.You've done it again Intuit.  You've driven me back to TaxCut.  The fault is none but your own.H&R Block TaxCut 2008 Premium Federal + State + e-file</review>

<review id="5365">Purchased this just to connect my girlfriend's brand new HP Windows Vista 64bit laptop to the cable modem wirelessly. All she wanted it to do was eliminate the cable running from the wall/modem to her desk when using the laptop at her desk, and also take the laptop out on the balcony (12 feet away) on occasion. Twelve hours of diligent work later, the thing is just an expensive and unneeded extension cord/paper weight. I tried EVERYTHING to get the wireless working. I worked through all the settings on Vista and in the Wireless manager application for the router many many times. Poured through Google searches. Contacted tech support. Reset dozens of times. I'm pretty stunned at how difficult this is. I mean, we're trying to connect ONE laptop to ONE always-on broadband modem through the very latest version of Windows Vista (all patches and updates installed) so we can eliminate eight feet of cord. HOW HARD IS THIS?? I would have thought for SURE by NOW -- 2009 -- there would be some type of plug and play mechanism for this very simple wireless task. I'm relatively savvy and don't mind configuring a few items at all but this is simply absurd. I expected 20-30 minutes and success, not twelve hours and failure. I don't know whether to blame Microsoft and Cisco equally, or just Microsoft, or just Cisco. I'm a PC user, but this experience in futility really makes me wonder -- would accomplishing this type of task have been possible on an Apple computer? Special mention goes to Linksys/Cisco's tech support -- absolutely useless. The PDF manual is likewise extremely lacking in explanation. I guess we'll just spring for a twenty foot network cable and put up with the stupid cord always being draped across the floor. Yay. Thanks Microsoft and Linksys, maybe in ten more years this task will be doable.</review>

<review id="5367">I have used QuickBooks in my business for approximately 15 years, most recently I have been using QuickBooks 2002. I decided it was time to upgrade to the latest version, 2009. This is not a software product, it is a disaster.When QuickBooks 2009 read my QuickBooks 2002 data file to convert it, QuickBooks 2009 crashed 3 times during the process. After two of the three crashes QuickBooks 2009 sent reports to Intuit, the third was so severe that it did not. After those crashes, I was not going to use QuickBooks 2009, but I decided to take a look for a few minutes anyway.QuickBooks 2009 wastes an enormous amount of screen space with its navigation diagrams, which were about 1/4 the size in QuickBooks 2002. This is a problem, we have a 21" monitor on the machine used for accounting, so we can review electronic records simultaneously while entering transactions in QuickBooks. QuickBooks 2009 now takes up so much space on the screen that it would not be possible to do this. I could not find a way to reduce the size of the navigation area, but perhaps that is just me. Perhaps I would just have to learn to use QuickBooks without the navigation feature.QuickBooks 2009 is very intrusive about information collection and selling additional Intuit 'services'.  From what I can tell, the functional changes as compared to earlier versions are small compared to the explosion in linkages to extra-cost Intuit products and services.I can recommend the Acronis True Image Home product. Before installing QuickBooks 2009, I used Acronis True Image Home to make a complete image of the hard drive, so I rolled back to the previous state of the system (with QuickBooks 2002) in a few minutes.</review>

<review id="5368">I bought the second one after the first one died on me because it is very easy to set up (plug it in and it starts to work) and cheap.However, router has some serious heating problem (really, it's burning hot!)...And my second router is starting to failing again after a couple of month of use (random disconnection).If you reset by turning off for a while and restart it, it becomes ok.But after a day or two starts to fail again.In addition, can't even go to the router setup page for securing the router.

<review id="5372">This has got to be the worst piece of you know what I have ever purchased.  I am very computer savvy, and tried a router from Netgear for the second time.  In both instances after the router was properly setup using their set up wizard, the router's wireless signal crashed all the computer's in my house.  When I called tech support they laughed at me telling me that such a thing is impossible, and that they have never heard of such a thing....which is interesting because the same thing had happened to me with the first Netgear router and I had called tech support about it.  Any way I am returning this router as well, and I will never buy any of this junk form Netgear ever again.</review>

<review id="5379">Here is a copy of my chat today with Seagate regarding the issues commented on here with this drive, which are the same issues I've experienced.  What bothered me was Seagate seems to deny there being any issue with the drive overheating and subsequently failing (I quote, "the design is the same but we have had no issues with overheating").  Is this grounds for a class action lawsuit? Keith: Hi, my name is Keith. How may I help you? Todd Nickolas: I have a replacement Seagate ST305004FDA1E1-RK FreeAgent Desktop 500 GB 3.5" USB 2.0 External Hard Drive arriving today because mine crapped out due to the same issues discussed here: Todd Nickolas:  http://www.amazon.com/review/product/B000ND75C0/ref=cm_cr_pr_hist_1?%5Fencoding=UTF8&filterBy=addOneStar Todd Nickolas: Has Seagate done anything to resolve these issues? Todd Nickolas: I don't want to go through the same massive data loss I did the first time. Keith: if you are talking about replacing the entire unit if the FreeAgent fails then that is still true. just remember that if the data is important to you have a backup (also known as a copy) of it in case of anything happening to the data weither it is virus or hardware related  Todd Nickolas: That's what the drive was purchased for in the first place, to back up data, which is kind of pointless if the drive has a history of failing due to overheating. Why should I have to buy a backup drive to backup my backup drive? Todd Nickolas: It's obvious Seagate is aware of this problem, so back to my original question, have they done anything to fix it? Keith: the replacement process of what you are talking about is nothing new for any of our products. however if you were using it as a backup then there should have been no data loss since all the data was in another place  Todd Nickolas: You're not getting the point. Having data backed up is pointless if your backup drive is unreliable, so I will ask again, has Seagate addressed the overheating and subsequent failure issues with this drive? Todd Nickolas: It's a simple "yes" or "no" question. Keith: the design is the same but we have had no issues with overheating   Todd Nickolas: No recent issues with overheating or no issues ever? Todd Nickolas: Because if you read through the link I sent you of Amazon product comments, a lot of customers would say otherwise. Keith: we are going by the testing we have done and the drives that have come back to us  Todd Nickolas: I'm not trying to be confrontational, but you're telling me that the design of the drive has not been changed (the plastic case and bottom ventilation, which were the main source of the overheating) yet that overheating is no longer, or has never been an issue. If overheating was/is not the problem, then can you please tell me what is causing these drives to fail, so that I can maybe get some pointers on using this drive so that it is less likely to fail? Keith: sure here are some pointers.....  Keith: keep it on a flat desk that has some romm around the drive and it is not crowded. do not run it hard 24/7. you can keep it connected to your computer if you do not run your computer 24/7. however if your computer does run 24/7 try unplugging it from time to time (thus the drive will turn off) using this method -- Answer Link:  http://seagate.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/seagate.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=683&p_created=985826313 also I would go to our website download and install the latest software and use the power management software so it can go into a standby mode so the drive is not again running 24/7 Keith: that is a start  Todd Nickolas: Does that link include instructions on how to disable the lights on the drive? Keith: the power settings should also address the light but there is no direct shut on/off button for the light  Todd Nickolas: OK, thanks. Keith: Is there anything else I can help you with?  Todd Nickolas: That's all for now. Todd Nickolas: Thanks. Keith has disconnected.</review>

<review id="5380">I had version 1 of this router for over two years. Worked great untill it just seized. I got another one, which happened to be the latest version 5.

<review id="5381">The product is fairly easy to install, though the interface is a little quirky. Wireless option is turned off by default. Starting it isn't as simple as clicking a button. The button is there but you can't click it. I had to go through the awful "Smart" Wizard to get it to enable the Wireless capability.Once setup, I was pleased to find out that my company VPN was able to connect. The problem is the range. I have an old Belkin 802.11 B WAP and the range is better with that than this router/WAP combo. I moved my laptop out of the office where it's located and the strength drops to almost half while when I test it with my old WAP, the strength barely flickers. I move it to the next floor and I lose all connectivity while I still have about 75% strength connecting to the old WAP.</review>

<review id="5382">I use my Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick almost exclusively for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This joystick lacks the precision for a good flight simulator experience. Specifically, the joystick seems to develop "gaps" in its ability to accurately translate a movement of the stick into a respose from the airplane; this results in unequal movements of the ailerons and rudder when comparing left/right motions. Additionally, the throttle control will not fully downthrottle the engine, so when making landings, I must resort to the keyboard to reduce power to idle. I had this problem with my first Logitech joystick, called the company, and they send me a free raplacement, but this one has now developed the same problems. I am a private pilot, and MS Flight Simulator is a great way for prospective pilots to learn to fly, but you'll be wasting your time if the joystick that your using will not accurately fly the airplane. This joystick may be good for rowdy shoot-em-up games that don't require precision, but its a poor choice for flying.</review>

<review id="5384">I would like to give it no stars but that's an option on Amazon rating. Bought in May (but only used about 4 times since then as we were away for a long summer). Used to blend tinned tomatoes. Worked fine couple of times then blades in blender, chopper and whisk turned very slowly and seemed to squeal when motor ran.  Called up Cuisinart and they sent me a new kit. Same thing happened. So I called again and they sent me chopper lid and whisk attachment (only blender had worked in new kit). Now I've the handstick that works very well (for how long though?), chopper grinder doesn't work at all and neither does whisk.  I looked inside the motor shaft and these "stripped teeth" everyone in the one-star category keeps on about are also looking that way in mine (I hadn't looked in the original one I sent back). Unfortunately I hadn't read the bad reviews before I bought it, and it seems that this "teeth stripping" is a continual problem with most of their hand sticks. I've already spent $20 between sending it back the first time and then receiving the new parts....I'd like to ask for a total refund for the now $70+ I've spent on it but I think such a request is futile.</review>

<review id="5385">It was the Holiday Season so we didn't expect the Mixer to get here overnight, although it take longer than usual for it to arrive.  However, when it did get here with some scratches on it, given its color and the fact the our kitchen is not the brightest, we didn't notice the blemishes until after my wife had been using it.  My personal thoughts were that the packaging that the unit was shipped in was slightly damaged thus creating the scratches, it was obvious the box did not appear to provide adequate protection during shipment of the unit.So far the machine has worked fine, but the craftsmanship seems far substandard to the one my grandmother used to have.  I hate to say it, but it does looks cheap in its appearance and the quality, but so far it has performed without a problem.</review>

<review id="5386">Kudos to "My Day," which aside from a few bugs and an eye-strainingly awful visual interface has the potential to be a helpful tool.Other than that, this "upgrade" provides no significant improvement (other than speed) over the functionality of Office 2004, and proves once again that Microsoft programmers think they know better than I do how I want my documents to look and how I want to organize my time.Furthermore, Microsoft has actually REMOVED HotSync support for Palm devices, and hasn't even seen fit to add Exchange support.  Clearly a product designed for someone who doesn't actually interact with the real world.Save yourself the headache.  Stick with Office 2004, or use iWork.</review>

<review id="5387">I bought this, I received another type of swaddling blanket and my baby HATED this. She didnt cry more, she screamed more when I tried to swaddle. The velcro was not strong and the way it contoured to my babys body was not smoothing to my daughter.. SO buy 1, receive 1 and if your baby likes it... maybe it will work but it was to no AVAIL for me...</review>

<review id="5388">Stephenie Meyer has lost her niche. The Twilight Saga has lost the magic it once held. Excluding Eclipse, maybe, after reading one of the other books for a second time; you start to see the little mistakes. Th sheen has warn off this new penny Stephenie Meyer has presented us with. This novel was not a novel. It was a straight cop out. A straight cop out that I bought at 12:30 A.M. I could've of read this trash on Fanfiction.net for free. I want a refund. No, as a dedicated twilight fan since I was 12, I deserve a refund.  SPOILERSSecondly what was she THINKING when she made Jacob IMPRINT on a child? A demonic child with an extremely white trash vampiric name mind you, but nonetheless a child. No matter how sick it seems, I suppose this was Meyer's way of saying: "Come on guys, see? It all works out in the end Bella and Edward are happily knocked up newlyweds and Bella's favorite werewolf is having a pedophile-like relationship with her kid.Alls well that ends well. Life can surprise you in very special ways, don't you think?" No. Not in this novel. I was surprised by how bad it was if that helps. But in a special way Stephenie. A very special way.Some other complaints I have include Bella as a vampire. In my opinion, as a human, she is probably  one of the most one dimensional characters in  English horror literature. As a vampire, she is even worse. Her conflicts and struggles don't come off as adding depth to her character. It makes her even more whiny than her usual human self. But this time around something made her a little easier to bear.Congratulations to the terrible plot.My special honor goes to you. The plot was as weak as Bella, but persistent. It just wouldn't stop coming back from the dead, reviving itself regardless of the pleas for it to just end it's life, and maybe that of the readers'.I think the only thing that could've save this book,was if Renesmee, really turned out to be Edward Cullen Jr. as Bella had planned.It as if all Stephenie Meyer did was head over to Fanfiction.net and took a few ideas from some clueless 10 year old. If you're going to take horribly corny intimacy scenes and terrible dialogue, you might as well have taken that one. It would have added some comedy to this melodrama. Jacob imprinting on a little boy is comedy genius if you ask me.Finally, my last complaint is Edward. What happened to everyone's vampire paramour with the body of granite? He turned into a wimp. In New Moon, when he decided kill himself after Bella jumped off a cliff, I thought he  couldn't get anymore pathetic, but I was wrong. Breaking Dawn clinched that. Quoting Jacob's new name for Edward, "The Burning Man" , is a spot on description of Edward's angsting. That's all he did for page upon page was angst. Sure he and Jacob became friends throughout he story, and the feeling of comradery was nice, but that didn't last. To sum it all up, this book was a failure.When you see Breaking dawn on the shelves of your Barnes and Noble, run for the children's section and into the solace of a Harry Potter book. It's  your only hope.</review>

<review id="5389">I really don't like it.  I mean it works, it's pretty fast, and the software that comes with it is pretty good.  There's just something about it that bugs me.  Maybe once a week or every other week I have to unplug the thing and plug it back in because both the computer that's directly connected to it and the wirelessly connected computer suddenly won't get any info from it.  Both computers will say they're connected but you won't get anywhere on the internet.  I don't really know what the problem is.  I know other people that give this item rave reviews.  I think next time i buy a wireless router i may look into the NetGear.</review>

<review id="5390">I tend to agree with all the other reviews so far, so I won't repeat what they said.  I do need to give a couple of warnings:1. Wireless internet connection doesn't work after upgrading to Windows XP SP3.  Once I upgrade, the wireless is able to connect to my router and my other PC's, but internet connection is spotty at best and broken at worst.2. Customer support is nonexistent!  I've emailed them a couple of times and no one has responded after three weeks.  They don't seem to offer telephone support.3. Reformatting drive using provided recovery disk crashes computer.  I thought my wireless issues might be a software issue so I tried using the recovery disk to start from scratch, but after the hard drive was reformatted, the computer would freeze on the initial 2goPC screen with no way of going forward.  I had to return the laptop to Amazon and get a replacement, which is when I figured out the wireless problem only occurs when Service Pack 3 is installed.</review>

<review id="5391">I read the reviews and then I bought this machine.  It certainly wasn't what I thought I would get.  The paddle doesn't scrape the sides during the freezing process and it ends up leaving more than an entire serving frozen to the sides while the rest of the ice cream rotates in the center and never quite gets to the frozen consistency.  Once the majority of the contents gets frozen it has a hard time churning and the stuff stuck to the sides gets colder while the center portion doesn't.  What a waste!!!  And dont even try and pry the stuff off the sides, it wont come off until it thaws or you rinse it down the drain.</review>

<review id="5392">Completely irredeemable, Bella's constant self-deprecation and unhealthy relationship with Edward makes this book a chore to read. Jacob's character has regressed to the point where all he cares about is Bella. Edward is unbelievably selfless and one dimensional. I kept reading this series in hopes that it would get better and live up to the hype, but alas, I will stop here.</review>

<review id="5393">If I could give it negative points, I would.  Not only does it state the obvious, by beliving in yourself is the likely way you will succeed, but I find it damaging to popular outlook on life.  The messege is, "don't do anything about what's wrong in your life, instead believe it's wonderful and you will feel wonderful!"  Riiiight, like let's think global warming isnt real and that my tumor will heal itself without medical attention?  And der, if I fool myself into thinking life is great and I'm having the best time of my life working 8-5 in a cubical and avoid all thoughts which could possibly be negative, then I'll be a blissful fool.Arugh, what a way to promote stupidy and inaction.</review>

<review id="5394">I mean it. I liked the book, that was more endurable for me. But this movie? I felt like it was made JUST for one gender. The only thing good was the suspense, story, and final fight scene. But this time, the story couldn't save it from being good. My 19- year old sister loved it, and same with all of the girls in the school. The boys pitied me for actually watching the WHOLE thing.It's not objectionably bad though. It's good for once a year.</review>

<review id="5395">I read it time and again:  Some people don't necessarily want to buy Office, but they think they have to.  If your employer or school requires it, I suppose the choice is made for you.  But this version of Office presents some very real problems.  If you are working in a PC-dominated environment, buying this version of Office is still not necessarily the answer.  First, there are the reasonably well-known limitations of the Home and Student Edition:  No support of Exchange or SharePoint, for example.  Then, there is the much criticized decision to leave VBA out of all 2008 editions of Office:mac, affecting mostly Excel macros.  But then there are the less-publicized omissions and missing features:  The Data Analysis Toolkit no longer works with Excel.  (It used to in version 2004, but due to the lack of VBA, no longer does.)  There is no equation editing in this version, nor will you be able to open those created in Windows versions of the software.  In fact, upon installation, Office does install a "readme" file (although it buries it in the program folder and does not call the user's attention to it) that contains a link to the "known issues" page for Office:mac at Microsoft's website.  There, you find a list of further obstacles and incompatibilities when trying to work with Office users on Windows or with older versions of the software.  And don't think these are isolated examples only power-users will encounter.  I ran into them in surprisingly short order.  Worse yet, there is currently no "test drive" version (as there was with 2004)for you to try before you buy.  With that "compatibility" so compromised, I can find no reason compelling enough to recommend this version of Office.  It's buggy, slow, and expensive.  Alternatives like iWork and OpenOffice are not only cheaper (or even free), they work much better.UPDATE - Since I first posted this review, there has been an update patch issued by MS, and the price of this software has been cut by a third.  My opinion and advice remain unchanged.  Avoid Office:mac 2008.  Performance, stability, and compatibility remain poor.  The only difference is that you will now waste "only" a hundred bucks, instead of one-fifty.</review>

<review id="5396">I work with a lot of images, and about a two years ago purchased three laCie hard drives, 500 gb, 1 tb and 1.5 tb.

<review id="5398">I'm disappointed I've used Sonicare for about 15 years. My latest one lasted about 3 years and then pooped out when the gree on-off button's seal failed and allowed rinse water to enter and ruin the works. So I ordered a new one- a e5000.This unit arrived in a clear, form-fitting polycarbonate bubble, fully welded to create a hermetic and utterly impenetrable package. There is no way "in" except to take a very sharp knife and try to cut this tough material open without damaging the products within. The package, once cut, is razor-sharp. Much force is required to cut the tough plastic. I URGE CUSTOMERS WHO INJURE THEMSELVES DOING THIS TO SUE PHILIPS FOR NEGLIGENCE. I struggled hard to open it....and I'm a burly Engineer!They clearly are trying to make a package that, once opened, can never bereclosed...thereby reducing returns. Its downright foolish and stupid.As for the product within...yes, it works OK. this model lacks the interval "timing" that all previous models I've used had...and there is a  bright green LED that blinks off and on all night making my nightime bathroom seem like some rented room above an old bar room, with its neon sign outside blinking.  I may change to another brand next time</review>

<review id="5402">I wish I had read the reviews above before buying this program. My Thinkpad died with a trojan. I had my backup copy of my novel I had written with Office (ms Word) for Windows. I bought a MacBook and this Office 2008 for Mac. When I opened my 260 page novel with this program, I found that ALL of my formatting had disappeared. As I tried to do something as simple as indent the first line of each paragraph, it wouldn't do it. After searching Help and spending hours of trial and error with no results, I called a writer friend who also has a Mac. He has Office 2004. We spent an hour on the phone going step by step together. When he selected all, the rulers remained in place and he could adjust the indents from there. When I, with Office 2008 for Mac selected all, the rulers disappeared. After many more experiences of this type (what worked in the 2004 version did not work in the 2008 version), I thanked my friend for his time and found a Mac Users' Group. I joined, posted my problem, and the responses I got were:1. "Get Office 2004", and 2."Read these reviews" followed by the link to this page.It looks like I wasted my money buying this program and having it FedEx'd to South America.Right now I am going paragraph by paragraph and using the tab key to indent the first line of each and every paragraph of the 260 page novel.Sincerely,Lynette Yetter</review>

<review id="5403">It would be hard to review an item that I never received.  The seller of this item is a scam artist.  He took my money and never sent the product.</review>

<review id="5404">This book turned out to be disapointing for me. In the three books before, I could really relate to Bella, she was clumsy, made mistakes, sometimes reckless, and I could understand her thought process. In Breaking Dawn, I feel like she loses all of that. She turned into this flat character. I also didn't care much for the one-big-happy-family ending. A little more conflict and sacrifice would have made for a better read for me.</review>

<review id="5405">After 13 months of use it started to emit a high frequency sound and stopped functioning. The LEDs flash on and off as though the unit is power-cycling. Although they now have a lifetime warranty on the Pro-Safe series, mine died outside of it's 12 month warranty. By the way, I used 7 of the 8 ports; the built-in power supply seems unable to handle the load.Would I buy another Netgear switch? I have another non-pro-safe Netgear switch that still works, but I sometimes need to power-cycle it to reconnect attached devices. I think I'll try another brand - perhaps Cisco.</review>

<review id="5406">Ooma sounded great but before I buy something like this I check out the support. There is none. 5 calls ended in 5 hang-ups. Check the reviews and you will see many, many notes about poor or non-existent tech support. My view is that this is very risky and you are likely to end up with no phone service at some time. Also some reviewers noted that they are lying about unlimited service. It is limited to 3000 minutes / month. Need to call out of country? Good luck on finding out what they will charge you for that. I would pass on this product for now. Maybe they make it, maybe they do not.</review>

<review id="5407">This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      Let's face it.... Pixar is great. They have come up with some of the most innovative ideas for movies in the last ten plus years. Some of their hits have been absolute masterpieces, Toy Story, Monsters.Inc and The Incredibles just to name a few. The problem with their last few movies, Walle and Ratatoille especially is that while they are innovative, the graphics are beautiful, the story line and plot are unique and interesting THEY ARE NO LONGER FUN. I found it a little insulting in Walle to see all the humans who are all fat and lazy and depend on the robots to do everything for them. Heck they couldn't even walk.... that is insulting. I thought the movie was okay but way to preachy but my main complaint is the fun. You know a kids movie is a little dull when all the kids in the audience, including mine, are asking "when is this thing ever going to be over...." That question shows that Pixar is concentrating so much on being artsy that they have forgotten how to make their movies fun.</review>

<review id="5408">I bought Seasons 1 and 2 after reading the reviews on Amazon, and an article on Entertainment Weekly's "Best of 2006" issue.This is not "the best television show", or "the best sci-fi show" or best anything.I have a lot of problems with the show:1.  Script is poor:  You would think that in the year they are living in, cancer would have been eradicated.  Yet it's not only still around, they are treating it in the same way as today.  At the very least, if they could replace a four-letter word with frak, they could have come up with a more creative name for cancer.  2.  Dr. Baltar and his Cylon consciousness or apparation or whatever on every single episode is overkill.  Also their overactive sex drive is getting tired.3.  I do agree with other viewers, this is not Battlestar Galactica.  They should have called it something else.4.  James Edward Olmos' performance is dry and stilted.  He looks more like a Cylon than the blonde bimbo seducing Dr. Baltar at every corner.5.  There is not enough character development.  I am having a hard time identifying with; really liking any of them.   Better sci-fi series are :  Firefly, The 4400. I am almost at the end of Season 1 and I am not sure I will watch Season 2, even though I already have it; and even though I am living outside the U.S. and desperate for tv series...Waste of time.</review>

<review id="5409">So I am going to start this review by saying that I am not a typical, obsessed "I heart Edward!!!!!" teenage Twilight fan- I am in my 20's and have always enjoyed the Vampire genre, stumbled upon these books a few months ago while searching for something to read during the long winter months, and was pretty intrigued by the darkness of her second (and best, in my opinion) book "New Moon" (I kind of thought "Twilight" was a little too childish and picture-perfect- I like Edward generally, but Bella's relationship with Jacob intrigued me much more since it was conducted on such a psychological level). I liked "Eclipse" (the antagonism between the characters was very well written and emotional), and was excited about "Breaking Dawn" despite the fact that I assumed Bella would end up with Edward at the end of the day (though I was fervently hoping that she would find a way to stay human). I wasn't expecting a work of literary genius here; I consider these books fun, easy reads with well developed and emotional story arcs that allow you to get lost in a fantasy world while providing some basic real-life metaphors (as all fantasy does). My qualm with "Breaking Dawn" is simply that through the course of the book this fantasy world becomes a rather boring caricature of itself- losing all tension and drama when the narrator, a flawed human who has always served as the eyes of the audience by peeking in but never fully existing in this fantastical world, becomes herself a powerful, perfected, and full member of a society that we simply cannot relate to. Suddenly all humanity is drained from the story; as the audience, we feel cheated that EVERYBODY (including a baby who is completely unnecessary and pretty annoying in her one-sided, paper-doll lovability) is above us now. We are shut out of the story, and the characters who we have grown to love because of their depth are either absent (Alice? Charlie? Billy?) or become one-dimensional to service a poorly-established final stand-off with the Volturi (Edward, Bella, Jacob, Carlisle).Unlike other readers, I didn't have an issue with the portion of the book written from Jacob's perspective (I actually thought this was the best part of the book, especially in his developing relationship with Leah). Nor do I have a problem with the sex scenes on the island- I found the honeymoon to be pretty amusing despite being overdone.  And, being a fantasy fan, I have no problem suspending belief for the sake of a good story, even for something as far-fetched as Bella's pregnancy. But having the emotional thread of the novel balance on a one-dimensional character we barely know, in concurrence with stripping Bella of her depth and treating her complicated friendship with Jacob as something that can simply be cured through convenient imprinting- rubbed me the wrong way. Gone was the heartbreaking end of "Eclipse" with her lost vision of dark-haired children, or the humor of her initial encounters with Edward in "Twilight", or the painful and sharply cerebral self-destruction of "New Moon." Here we have a perfect baby, a perfect family, a perfect cottage, a perfect future couple, who all are perfectly powerful beyond belief. One book ago, Stephenie Meyer captivated us with stories of warring Vampire covens and Native American sacrifices and balancing physical with emotional power to make even the most flawless character vulnerable. These details are what gave this series life- Charlie's lumpy spaghetti, Jacob's warm sodas, Edward's love of incredibly overpriced cars, Bella's self-deprecation. Having these profoundly human moments rendered to hazy, vague memories in Bella's new and improved Vampire brain simply do not do them, or the human audience who related to them, justice.</review>

<review id="5410">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      I have to admit, my expectations were high.  After reading Twilight, I was very excited to see where the story of Edward and Bella would go next.  I once had a creative writing teacher, and he would always say, "It's not about putting the lovers together, it's about keeping them apart."  Stephanie Meyer has that concept down, but I think it ends there.  I kept on reading the book with frustration.I felt like most of the novel (up until Alice's arrival in Forks) was pure filler - Stephenie Meyer's way of setting up the climax.  In my opinion, it was too much.   WE GET IT.  Edward left to keep her safe, Bella was miserable without him.  And then Jacob comes along?  Honestly, I kept of waiting for Jacob's character to have a more significant role at the very end.  Every time Bella was pondering about Jacob I was rolling my eyes.  Perhaps it was the lack of Edward in this book that put me off (my favorite character in the series by far - I wanted to see what he was doing!).  I felt like Stephenie Meyer was trying to get me to like Jacob too much, and I ended up resenting his character more (especially towards the end).While this story didn't have the "dazzle" that Twilight had for me (sorry had to do it), it was an okay read.  And I am hoping Eclipse is a stronger read than New Moon.</review>

<review id="5411">I have to agree with everyone else's negative reviews. The series ends with Eclipse. This book was the most bizarre story I have ever read. I personally like when an author ties up all the loose ends but to completely change everything you said previously to cram in something that shouldn't make sense...I mean its just ridiculous. Its like she completely lost her direction and started writing anything she could think of and would break her own rules in the twilight world just so it would fit. It wasn't pretty and I didn't enjoy it...</review>

<review id="5412">The 'Flip Video Ultra' has been ultra dissapointing from the beginning (i've had mine a few months now, but only recently took it out of the box, so it's probably an older model).  The major problems are that the 'record' button does not work properly, the videos are not uploading to my computer at all, and the firmware upgrade took about 3 hours, then created onscreen freezes of the 'Flip Video' software (on the Windows 'Desktop') that I couldn't get rid of unless I shut the power off and on on my PC!  When I hit 'record' (or to stop recording for that matter), the unit does not engage easily, or even at all.  I often have to frustratingly hit the record button over and over, and even press very hard.  Secondly, the videos are not uploading to my computer using the Flip Cam's software.  An onscreen box comes up that tells me that videos are being transferred, and 'to wait', but even after HOURS, the 'percentage done' bar does not move from 0%, and nothing gets uploaded!  Lastly, I went to their website where I found a suggestion to download the latest firmware for this unit, and it took HOURS.  Then 'Step 3' of the firmware download froze my computer after the download finished, and I had to hit the power switch to reset!  So I am not even 100% sure that the firmware actually 'took'!  I am running 'Kaspersky internet security 7.0' software, and did a complete system scan for adware/spyware/viruses (of which I had none) before I attempted to update the firmware, so it can't be my computer.  My P3, 1 GHz system runs Windows XP, service pack 2, and I have had no problems whatsoever with every other program I run on it.  I am VERY dissapointed with this 'Flip' cam, and for now, I will just let it sit in the closet and collect dust, until I have the patience to deal with this P.O.S. again, if ever.  I wasted half my day attempting to get this substandard product to just work!!!  Also note that as of this writing, there are 67 '1 star' reviews here (and 42 '2 star reviews')... CLEARLY there are major issues with this cam for a large percentage of their customers.  That says a lot!  Buyer beware.</review>

<review id="5413">There are two major flaws with this product.  First, the shaver requires an enormous 8-hour charge for a measly 50 minutes of use. Not only is this not efficient it's also inconvenient.  The only time I am at home for that long is when I am sleeping.  The fact that the batteries lifespan is reduced from overcharging does not help this flaw.  Second, all the attachments trap the hair in them and clog up.  This means in order to shave your body you have to constantly push out the trapped hair. All in all, I would like to see a higher quality product for more money.  As it is you're better off buying a nice Wahl beard trimmer.</review>

<review id="5414">The bad news is that the mixer (6 qt. Pro) sounded bad right out of the box.  It got to the point where the motor was scary after one month of use.  The good news is that after calling and letting the customer service actually listen to it, they replaced it immediately, even though the service rep seemed to indicate that we had done something wrong. The new mixer is not exactly quiet either, but haven't used it yet, just turned it on to see how it sounded.  We had a 4 1/2 qt mixer for years and the motor sounded like a mixer usually does.</review>

<review id="5415">I bought this mixer in December 2006. I have probably used it once a month. Currently the mixer experiences uncommanded speed increases and won't slow down. It consistently does this now. I noted when I bought it Amazon advertised it as made in USA, but the product says made in China. I would not recommend buying this unless you want a disposable product.</review>

<review id="5416">**WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS****  I LOVED the first three Twilight saga books.  New Moon is my favorite because I am (well, actually was) firmly on Team Jacob and Meyer developed that character well in that book.  I did not like Breaking Dawn.  First, one of the strengths of the first three books were the metaphorical references to abstinence,  resisting temptation, and the cautionary tales against marrying/dating someone of a different faith.  Well, all that goes to "hell" (pardon my french here) in BD.  Bella gets married to Edward and they live happily ever after.  What?  In the first 3 books, Meyer did so much to foreshadow Bella's death and destruction for involving herself with a vampire and then she ends the story like a Disney fairy tale.  I was shocked and dismayed.  Second, no one dies.  There is supposed to be a battle of apocalyptic proportions against the most powerful vampires in the world, but everyone survives without a scratch. How convenient.....and unrealistic.  As an adult reader, I felt offended by this.  I cried for a straight half hour when Dumbledore died.  I mourned him for weeks.  ANd I applauded Rowling for having the guts it took to kill him off.  Rowling had enough respect for her readers to know we could handle the death of a beloved character.  Apparently Meyer does not think we can handle death during a major battle scene.Also, the addition of all the new vampires in BD was distracting.  I spent too much time remembering them and they added very little to the story.  And the whole thing of "we just need you to witness for us, but you really dont have to fight" was ridiculous.  Like anyone for one second thought the Volturi would buy that.And finally, the whole Renesme thing bothered the heck out of me. Her name was ridiculous.   Jacob's imprinting on the baby was a cheap way out of the most important conflict in the saga: the love triangle between Bella, Edward, and Jacob.  Once again, Meyer does not seem to like confrontation and conflict.  What a cop-out!All in all, you have to read the book, because it answers the question regarding Bella's immunity to some vampire offenses, like Edward's mind reading.  However, this book is not nearly as good as the first three and leaves the reader feeling cheated.</review>

<review id="5417">After watching ?of the first disk, I had to stop because I felt like I was brought to a slaughter plant to watch for two hours how animals are being killed alive; one animal after another, with close-ups, in slow motion, with numerous replays from different angles, with no mercy or desire to make it less graphic on the screen. I was so depressed I couldn't believe that somebody actually liked it. This video must be sold in a horror department or at least some warning should be put on the box. I don't care how important killing is in animals' life, but I believe this is one of those disturbing moments that must be avoided in the videos aimed at general audience. There are other more artistic ways to convey to the audience the importance of "food chain" in wild nature than just show acts of eating of life preys in slow motion. I think that the authors were after cheap "shock and awe" effect more than anything else. If that's what you are looking for, it is a great work and you will get a lot of excitement. But if you don't enjoy watching animals being killed, don't bother buying this DVD.</review>

<review id="5418">The mouse worked for a while then started to malfunction.  Dealing with Razer support was a nightmare.   Trust me when I say they do not back their  products.   They will do everything in their power not to replace defective product.  Many complaints on product quality..not worth the money and hassle.  Just to give you an example they told me that online purchases are NOT covered under warranty.</review>

<review id="5419">Intuit charges banks extra to support Mac users, and many banks don't pay.  So the convenience of automated transaction downloads is impossible for me on Quicken Mac.  Several other features are lagging behind the Windows version.  And for some inexplicable reason, transferring data between Quicken for Windows and Quicken for Mac isn't complete or straightfoward.I haven't used competing products, but for Mac users I recommend either running the Windows Quicken version (using Boot Camp or Parallels) or buying another product.  And by all means, let Intuit know that their pricing practices are costing them customers.</review>

<review id="5420">I am so disappointed with this ice cream maker.  The first time i used it i followed all of the directions carefully and it looked like soup!  Then today i tried a different recipe and the same thing soup!!!I honestly though Cuisinart was an excellent brand befor this.  I would be better off using a blender!  The only thing that this does is basically stir this around.  I would highly advice against purchasing this model.</review>

<review id="5421">I wish Amazon would let you give zero stars... I have been wrestling with this hideous mistake for a week now.  Downloaded the "current" drivers from D-Link, etc. I could get it to work, but it kept wonking out my Vista Business edition.  Got the Blue Screen of Death twice and finally decided to uninstall it.  But I CAN'T!!!!!  The unsupported software from D-Link will not uninstall.  Don't buy this.  Don't buy this.  Don't buy this.</review>

<review id="5422">I read all the reviews and decided this was the best, despite the many 1 star ratings i saw.  I reasoned this because i figured I could always install the DD-WRT third party firmware.  Anyway, the wireless works flawlessly, which is why I wanted it.  However, on my dads desktop (which is not wireless enabled and thus wired to the router)... it loses the internet.  Dont ask me how.  All that is requried to restore the connection is to unplug the internet and plug it back in.  Presto.  Works perfectly again.  I was going to instal the DD-WRT, but I realized i probably dont have the tech confidance to do it myself.  So many to choose from, what do I do?  Anyway, this review is a plea for help and a statement that this really is a great product, when it is working.  As for me, it works fine on my laptop via the wireless connection... but the wired connection to my dads computer is flaky.  Tech support was great, helpful, but ultimately unable to properly diagnose and fix the problem.  Any ideas, any help?  Thanks.</review>

<review id="5424">I took a chance on this Breadman, since I only had my previous Breadman Deluxe for a little over a year before the bread pan started leaking out the bottom.  I was going to give it a chance and was completely disappointed.  Upon arrival, the Bread Machine did not ever work; every time I pressed start the error code was E00 or E01.  E00 and E01 are error codes for the unit is too cold or too hot, respectively.  This would make sense had I baked bread, but I never did.  These errors were present from the time I took it out of the box.  I'd press start, E01 would flash.  I'd unplug and let it sit for about 20 minutes.  I'd plug it in, press start again, E00 would flash.  This went back and forth until I gave up, put it in the box, and shipped it right back out.Last, there is some evidence to back this up but I cannot claim that this next statement is 100% fact, but here ya go.  I am almost positive that the Breadmaker I received had already been returned once.  Evidence: cord was not wrapped (like a new breadmaker), the plastic film that the instruction booklet told me to remove from the LCD screen was not present, the breadpan was a little dirty, there was a slight scratch on the LCD screen, and there were finger smudges present on the stainless still unit.  Doesn't make much of a difference since the unit failed to work, but that seems shady.  Whether it's Amazon or whether it's the company the dropped shipped the unit, if it was opened, used by another customer, returned, then shipped back out to me... no bueno.Two broken Breadman's for me = no more Breadman.  Now on to looking for an alternative (sigh).</review>

<review id="5425">The 2008 H&R Block TaxCut Premium has a serious compatibility problem with importing information from TurboTax records.  I found an IRA basis carryover of zero in Form 8606; totally inaccurate data imported to the two year summary comparison; and an inability to calculate a tax penalty form (similar to a 2201) stating that you must download this from the state taxing authority website and fill it out manually!  I stopped checking my returns at this point, contacted H&R Block and was told that "There are compatibility problems".  I was offered a refund which I have accepted.  Now back to TurboTax?</review>

<review id="5426">It is Inuit's prerogative to change the terms of their license, but if you don't like it, vote with your feet and use a competing product - I am.  A several years ago Intuit restricted the number of computers you could install the software on (to just one I think) and people switched to computing products in drovers (including me). The next year they gave up on that practice.  Personally I would much rather have them limit the number of computers it can be installed on than to you to one 'free' return.  I do my taxes and two family members - as a favor.  I could do those returns without software, but why should I if I am already buying software for myself.  I will not pay Intuit another $20 for those returns - nor $60 just to do my own. I don't care about the "free" e-filing - actually I think it is a crime that the government couldn't come up with a standard format that tax programs could produce so returns could be filed directly to the IRS site without a 3rd party getting involved (and making a profit).  I am sure they could do that for less than it costs them to process paper returns.  I used Tax Cut a few years ago and it wasn't quite as polished as TurboTax, but it was fine.  From what I've read, the gap between products has narrowed.  I guess I will find out for myself soon enough.</review>

<review id="5428">This router worked for just over a year; I just spent almost an hour troubleshooting with them on the phone, only for them to tell me that it has "gone bad" and there is nothing they can do about it!!! I asked to speak to a supervisor, and they still refused to help. They acknowledged that their product went bad but said because it had been more than a year (2 months over a year), they are not liable. I will never buy another Netgear product again, and I am filing a claim with my credit card company (GO AMERICAN EXPRESS! At least THEY were sympathetic and are going to refund my money).</review>

<review id="5429">This is my 2nd Linksys router.  Totally a frustration in the 2 months that I have owned it.  If there is a power glitch, I'm crawling around on the floor shutting down the modem, router, switching cables, etc. to get my router to grab the IP.If that doesn't work, I'm on the phone w/ Linksys support.  I have had to update the firmware twice.I will NEVER buy Linksys again.  They do not seem the same in reliability since CISCO bought them.  Glad I sold my CISCO stock!</review>

<review id="5430">Your out of your mind if you buy this. Its better used as a paper weight than a trimmer or shaver. Second use and the foil came right off. My god did it hurt! I couldn't get it back on, shaver was destroyed. :( I consider myself to be the ultimate consumer. Especially of useless gadgets but this one tops the list. If you want a good trim and shave in the shower of your most important parts here is want i recommend. Buy a Fusion 5 and a Wahl trimmer. The cheap AA battery type from your local drug store. I paid $10 of mine. I use mine in the shower every week despite that it says keep it dry. I have had it for 2 years and I get it soaking wet and never had a problem. Cuts right through wet hair. Save yourself the money,time and frustration. If your going out on a date you'll save yourself the embarrassment when your unmentionables and the garden looks like the gardener was drunk.</review>

<review id="5431">I was hoping for a soft feel, these are not. First washing sheets were very wrinkled, once on bed wrinkles were gone.

<review id="5432">just spent 3 hours trying to install this on a machine running XP.there were at least six issues that Intuit knows of but does not have any fixes for.i ran through all of their general troubleshooting suggestions (multiple times) and nothing worked.i am returning this.</review>

<review id="5433">I bought this router even after the mixed reviews since most of the time problems are more to do with the system/user - that was a mistake. After spending hours on the technical support site and going over the troubleshooting guide I still couldn't even get the computer to talk to the router atall. All the LED's were lit as required but the software just wouldnt go to the setup sequence. After trawling the guide and going through the nine steps I was told to contact technical support - no thanks - I want a product that works as advertised - I didn't sign up for hours of networking troubleshooting.</review>

<review id="5436">I bought this at WalMart.  It was fairly easy to install, but didn't ever work that well, with frequent times that it didn't seem to recognize my internet connection.  Many times, watching netflix on my laptop or something, it would just go out, and I'd have to reboot or reestablish the connection, etc.  After about 3 weeks of use, it pooped out altogether, and the internet light won't come on at all.  There's a warranty, but in order to get them to send me a new one, they require putting a hold on my credit card, which I think is annoying, and I'm not sure I really want another one anyway.  Maybe I just got a defective one, but it was a great disappointment.  I used to have one that came with my verizon service, and it NEVER failed to work, so after having completely consistent service, going to service you could never count on, and then none at all has been a TOTAL DRAG and a waste of time and money.</review>

<review id="5439">The features of this product are awesome -- and the unit's interface is excellent.  We purchased the 2GB m250 from Amazon for our daughter for Christmas.  It was an amazing, compact, solid-state unit -- and it was very, very good......until out of the blue after a couple of weeks, the unit 'froze' (wouldn't 'boot'... wasn't detected when plugged into the computer).  Suggestions by SanDisk corporate support were fruitless.  We exchange the product through Amazon.  All was well... upon getting the new device, we quickly upgraded the firmware (through the SanDisk site) just in case it was firmware weirdness that caused the issues with the first unit.  Our daughter was happy, demonstrating the flexibility of an MP3/WMA player over a iPod Nano to her friends.  We were pleased......until one week later, again the second unit 'froze'.  It is unrecoverable, and per other reviews, Amazon declined to exchange it for another unit -- which is fine with me -- instead, giving us our money back.  Clearly, there is a manufacturing defect somewhere.  I would love to love this device... but I cannot recommend it.  You will be disappointed as you fall in love with it -- only to go through the hassle of out-of-the-blue-freezes which render the unit inoperable and unrecoverable.No more SanDisk products for our family.  A shame... the potential for this product is -- er, was -- amazing.</review>

<review id="5440">This review is from: Australia (DVD)      Very bad,boring poor acting I wasted my money!!!Oscars nomination?Well I guess if you put in the movie oppressed blacks and racial discrimination 90% of the time you will get a nomination,it becames just poor taste regurgitating all the same...time for healing yet???</review>

<review id="5441">I don't want to be redundant and reiterate many of the valid points already written here - and I also don't want to be cruel to a writer who I believe is quite talented. I myself am a published author/illustrator and it breaks my heart to see such a fantastic series end so poorly. Some things I didn't see addressed:First and foremost, one of the most compelling things about the series was the incredible sexual tension. I understand this is YA, but it is a romance novel. I expected some form of love scene, done tastefully that would depict the beauty of a loving union. Why is that so taboo? Why is it more appropriate to write about Bella mauling lions, drinking blood, having monster babies aborted....than to describe the much anticipated union with her husband?Something is way twisted about that.I shuddered at parts of this book, having a hard time reading through it.It was just downright gruesome. Unnerving. Sadisitc even - and I am such an open minded person.I agree the pregnancy thing totally took me out of the story and shocked me. Bella's reaction just wasn't realisitc at all. You can't have a character switch and do a 180 like that. It begins to break down the readers faith in the characters. And then Jacob imprinting on Bella's baby was beyond unbearable. It just was the creepiest twist in the entire story to me. Yes, I was secretly hoping Jacob and Bella ended up together. It seemed the most real ending. However, I also liked Edward. I anticipated finding out who finally won her heart. Making Jacob fixate on a baby just really disturbed me. I know that wasn't Meyer's intention, but it is just beyond unnatural. Even if writing in the supernatural context - it just plays on too many real social issues with pediphiles. Yuck.Finally, for me the true let down of this last book was it lacked passion - it lacked true connection & emotion. I could pick apart some of the internal logic, but as a fantasy writer myself, that is truly hard to pull off. I am saddened for Meyer - it takes alot of time & dedication to write a series of this magnitude, and although there were some shining moments "like escaping into Jake's head"the book is a very disappointing end to an otherwise  engaging & captivating tale.</review>

<review id="5442">Iomega came highly recommended and I had high hopes. The actual product was a huge disappointment. I have now had two, both of which died in less than a month.

I would never purchase this product again.</review>

<review id="5443">While I may be a small minority, I needed to return my camera to Amazon because it had an intolerable tendency to lock up when downloading videos to my PC.  This happened on three different PCs (all recent Windows XP machines), so I know it is a fault with the camera.  The problem is evident whether I use the included software to download the videos (yes, I am using the latest version), or whether I simply do a drag-and-drop to a folder.  I am guessing that they use a cheaper quality flash memory, and I just happened to get a faulty chip.  But hey, it happened to me, so it can happen to you.  Otherwise, I loved the video quality and ease of use, but the tendency to lock up unexpectedly means that this particular camera was of absolutely no use or value to me.</review>

<review id="5444">I own this router along with the D-Link WAU-2340 wireless adapter for less than one year.  About 6 months ago the adapter stopped working.  I dealt with folks on the west coast and had a new unit shipped to me although I had to send back the damaged one at my cost (fed ex).   It just stopped working again and I have been on the phone for more than 2 hours with folks from India.  Not to be biased as I have had great success with Indian customer service for other products but these folks were rude, impatient and annoying. One actually hung up on me.  They are telling you to do things at breakneck speed while you're trying to understand what they're saying.  If you forget one thing they get annoyed and say things line "What did I tell you a moment ago - you weren't listening" with the attitude of a teenager. They want to get you off the phone asap so they tell you to do something then call them back (which had me on hold for up to 30 minutes - 2 times) If this is customer service its not what we are accustomed to in the US.  SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GET A LINKSYS</review>

<review id="5445">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      This has got to be one of the worst books I've ever had the displeasure of reading. It holds no reference to the classical vampires created by Bram Stoker. Since when do vampires go to school in daylight? Isn't that breaking a completely fundamental rule that makes vampires vampires?Besides, if Edward and his family freaked out about Bella cutting her hand, wouldn't Eddie be driven mad every single time Bella was on her period? You'd have lots and lots of undead tampons running around, methinks. Vampire-proof your unmentionables, Bella!In the end, this book sucks, unlike the vampires in the book.</review>

<review id="5446">Having used wireless routers for several years, we thought they would be commoditized when we went to buy a new one about a year ago, and so bought the cheapest one (this Trendnet). I think we continue to use it to network two laptops to the internet just to see how much frustration we can take. Our laptops work fine when on campus and at friends' houses, but at home the wireless frequently drops even when in the same room as the router, and every 2-4 days, the wireless will totally cease to work, not allowing any wireless connectivity whatsoever until the router is rebooted.Might have gotten a poor model. Wired connectivity works as expected, so not 1 star.(The wireless just dropped in the time it took me to write this review. "Repaired" the connection in WinXP in order to post. I think we're going to get a Linksys WRT router very, very soon.)</review>

<review id="5447">I bought this router because I believe Netgear product is good. However, it is not. This router make hate Netgear. I owned a Netgear router before, and that one work great.

I am going to try and send it back to Amazon, if they won't take it back I will go Office Space on it with a golf club.</review>

<review id="5450">We had a baby safety company baby-proof our home, and several safety gates were installed. The Kidco, inc pressure gate works well in our hallway and is easy to open and close. We have two Evenflo Walk-through stair gates. One, at the top of the stairs, works fairly well, but you need to use two hands when opening and closing this gate (which means putting down a crying child momentarily while wrestling with the gate). The one at the bottom of the stairs is useless, since the wood appears to have warped and can not be closed without pulling the entire gate (screws and all) out of the wall. We're in the process of looking for another gate (anything-but-wood)which can be opened easily with one hand.  Hope this helps.</review>

<review id="5453">This purchase was a big dissapointment. Based on other reviews I expected it to work much better than my old battery powered trimmer that needed to be replaced. This product has false promise of being the best, when in fact it is far worse than my previous battery powered trimmer.

<review id="5454">I just finished the final book in the Twilight series and I am disappointed to say the least. The novel felt cheesy and SM seemed determined to give every single character a perfectly happy ending.</review>

<review id="5455">I am disappointed in this product. I bought it for my daughter who has really taken to using the MS Movie Maker program and has been recording videos on her Canon digital camera (5 MP PHOTO camera that also does low quality videos). I expected that this camcorder would be a big jump in usabilty and quality for her. What a disappointment.The video is very jerky; It really needs image stabilization. The indoor and low-light performance is WORSE than the Canon digital photo camera when operating in video mode if you can believe that. The Sony software is confusing and junky. She just wants to plug in the camera and select a new or existing folder in "My pictures" and have the videos show up there. Instead the Sony software pops up and it does various stuff to download the video from the camera and convert it or something. It's clunky - again we want: plug-in, select folder, download, play. That is not what you get with this Sony software.Now the worst part. The MPEG-4 video format is not compatible with MS Movie Maker so now my daughter is unable to do what was so very easy to do with the Canon camera and MM. I have tried various free utilities to convert MPEG-4 to AVI so MM could use it but so far have been unsuccessful. The programs are slow, the interfaces are clunkly and worst part I have yet to find one that actually works. I am sure there must be but I just have not found it yet. You also can't play these videos in Windows Media Player. Quicktime does play them.At this point I am considering buying some commercial software that can edit MP4 videos. I worry that it will be too complex for my daughter to use. Good editing software can be $100 or more. Oh, and by the way, this camcorder does not come with a memory card so be prepared to spend another $30 to $50 on that depending on size. Overall, a big let down. I really wish I had sent it back but it's too late now. Some folks say that it's a great bargain at $200 and maybe it is. But it's no bargain if it gathers dust on the shelf and is not used because it's too hard and the quality is too low and there is no way to edit the clips into a useful movie without buying commercial software for $$$.</review>

<review id="5456">Spoilers below. Duh.Well, let me just start out saying that I completed the whole series in less than a week. I just finished Breaking Dawn and I am already here writing about how I cringe at the lack of satisfaction.I do have to give you this... The wedding, the honeymoon (pre-pregnancy debacle), and Bella being a vampire storylines were incredible. My heart raced with Meyer's almost-excessive description of Bella's emotions, for example during the wedding. I also enjoyed Meyer's subtle humor she implanted on many of the characters although I can remember no single scene through my anxiety, of which you will experience should you choose to continue reading!This is where my positives end and negatives begin. Pregnancy? Where did that come from!? Uh, how about NO! They get married and WHA'BANG, she's pregnant. I feel as if the pregnancy and subsequent baby Renesmee pages within the book could be torn out and burned. Seriously! (Don't get me started on the naming of the child too, Renesmee? I couldn't pronounce that even on the last page!) As for the lack-luster, passionless Bella-becomes-a-vampire, thing wasn't spectacular either. Granted, IT FINALLY HAPPENED (there is a God!), but how the whole affair is described... Edward rips Bella's womb open with his vampire-serrated teeth and subsequently injects her dying heart with his venom with a syringe! Where's the intimacy? Where's the passion? (I guess I am biased though. I think he should have just let her become a vampire back in Twilight. Damn, Carlisle... suggesting Edward suck the venom out! Who does that!?) The whole series was building on the impending neck bite by Edward, turning his love into an immortal. Meyer destroys such a satisfaction for readers! Would a vampire snarl and gritted teeth be appropriate here on my part? I think so.As for the fight with the Volturi... A big problem is that it NEVER happens. Meyer keeps building and building. She carefully describes the "abilities" of all the characters and when it comes down to using it in a real fight... Well, Bella does her shield thing and all is honky dory by page 739. I would like to see some supernatural dismemberment here!   Speaking of "abilities," I feel like this whole super power thing got way out of hand. Isn't it enough to allow for the MERE EXISTENCE of vampires (and shape-shifting wolves)? I accept that Alice's ability to see into the future and Edward's mind reading ability added to the story but, it became EXCESSIVE when it seemed that everyone had a talent for something! I think the mere existence, the out-of-world thought that vampires exist among us would be QUITE ENOUGH to move a great storyline along. I recommend borrowing this book from someone else who made the mistake of paying for it, like me!I plead to Stephanie Meyer, could WE PLEASE HAVE A REWRITE!? PLEASE! (And forget having the stupid baby! That was undeniably the worse plot twist ever!)</review>

Upon giving up a few hours and some blood installing it in my car, I was dismayed to find it wouldn't charge my new Nano.  I then did my research and found that Apple put the screws to us customers just to make their life simpler (warranty claim issues with old pin configuration). I checked the 4G Nano in my wife's Sony clock/radio docking station, and it's the same thing - no charging.  I am pissed, my wife is near tears, and have no idea what I will do.

<review id="5463">Three reasons why I will not touch any Corsair USB memory drive again:1) As the other reviewer pointed out (4 gig) "The wide, thick rubber gasket surround the USB connector limits how far you can insert the connector into even lightly recessed USB receptacles". I thought it was just mine! There is not enough metal exposed so it means the drive frequently disconnects, loosing valuable data in the process and crashing the PC often.2) Right from day one, the drive would show up as a USB Hub (I think it uses this to control 4 chips inside instead of a single chip). But this would at least 50% of the time cause any other device to be inserted into the same USB port on removing the memory drive not to be recognized - only a reboot would fix this. I tried this on many laptops/desktops and got the same results.3) I contacted Corsair who said to ship it back to them even though the local retailer would take it back. Since I was out the country I told them I was uncomfortable posting it internationally (back to them in Fremont, CA) using ordinary post (courier would have been 50% of what I could buy it new for). But they pushed for this without offering to pay for the post so ordinary post it went. They now claim not to have received it and now unlike the other reviewer I do not even have own a $100 paper weight.I'd like to say a lot of other things, but fear that Amazon will not print it, so lets leave it at the simple facts above. I don't think I have been so disgusted at a company of peripherals as much as Corsair. And for Corsair to validate what I have said is true, my RMA Number: R153005</review>

<review id="5464">I was very excited when I read all the reviews for Gridlock Puppy Training wee wee pads in hopes that it would be the magic pad for my magic mutt. Although I was pleased at the absorbency and quick drying, my puppy did not share the same feelings...everytime she tried to squat her tiny paws would slip and she could not get a grip when going on the pad... though soft, its very slippery. I'm a little sad I bought a 100...I'll keep them for traveling...This is the third brand she has tried, and she was much more responsive to the other two...I would buy a small pack first.</review>

<review id="5465">Sadly, this is a Harry Potter style documentary about the vaaaasst mysterioussss deaddddlyyy planet Earth. It also mimics the style of Hollywood I guess in trying to impress the teenager or 20 something year old male. When you turn the Harry Potter sound off the camera is amazing. But still nothing for gentle nature loving children, the makers of this documentary for some reason forgot about them.</review>

<review id="5466">Intel Macs running the current version of Mac OS X (10.4.9) are incompatible with this router.  The configuration page does not render properly on any of my three Macs, regardless of whether they use a wired or wireless connection.  And with the latest AirPort firmware on the MacBook, the WPA settings cause a system crash (kernel panic).D-Link technical support was no help.  I sent them an email with a screen shot from Safari and Firefox, and they responded: "You shoudl [sic] be able to do it with safari.  Can you try it in another environment?"   So they didn't properly answer my question, and they never responded to my two follow-up emails.  Zero stars for tech support!The reason I'm giving this product two stars is that it did work properly with my Windows computers.  But Intel Mac users should look elsewhere.  I did.</review>

<review id="5467">I have used turbotax for many years.  After reading that turbotax was going to charge an additional $9.95 for printing extra returns, I ordered H & R Block's Taxcut software from Amazon.  I will recommend to all of my family members and friends to order the taxcut tax software.  I am very disappointed that turbotax would add these additional fees, in these uncertain economic times.</review>

<review id="5468">Amazon has deleted over 270 negative reviews of TurboTax. Looks like Amazon is in bed with TurboTax and has "rigged" the reviews.As for TurboTax.. lets go back to about 2003 when we had the C Dilla fiasco. Intuit promised then, to never again place restrictive code (DRM)on our PC's. Fast forward to 2008... Once again Intuit tries to add DRM code on our computers to limit the number of returns. So I have to assume the "word" of Intuit is meaningless!So now that Inuit has outrage it's very loyal customers once again, Intuit relents and offer 5 free federal e files. That is pretty pathetic in light of the fact that 5 free e files is exactly what TaxCut offered more than a week earlier. So all TurboTax did was match TaxCut's offer but at a much higher price. This offer is of no value to those who do not and will not use e file. No roll back of the $15 price increase over last year's excessively high prices.</review>

<review id="5469">All I have heard about the Chi is that is so wonderful, I purchased one for myself and one for my daughter. We received them 8 days after I ordered them. Mine pinches my hair and pulls it out. It is not a flat connecting ceramic surface. I am guessing it is defective. I did email the company that sent it to me (at the request of Amazon before I wrote this review - so they would have a chance to remedy the problem), I have not heard a word from the company. I owned a ceramic flat iron (different brand) and had no problems with it and it cost less than half of what I paid for the Chi. I am sure my Chi is the only one that does that since everyone else loves theirs. I am not happy that I spent that much money and bought it online where it is such a hassle to return/exchange. I have learned my lesson to never buy anything online.</review>

<review id="5470">It's been said that it's unfair to expect too much fun or humor from this series, but the reason fun and humor was expected is because it's called "Battlestar Galactica". You can't blame people for being put off by the major changes. Sadly one shouldn't expect anything close the the tone of the original.  It's too bad the new Doctor Who isn't available in the U.S. instead. It's new yet faithful. That's the way you do it.</review>

<review id="5472">I love, love, LOVED my Chi hair straightener; then it just stopped working. It always worked wonders on my hair, but it wasn't worth the $100+ for only two months. If you buy it online, the warranty is void. Wish someone had told me that. Save some cash and do a little more research on other brands. You're bound to get lucky and find a cheaper product that won't bust after eight weeks.</review>

<review id="5473">There are three questions I dreadfully expect my child to ask me once it grows up a bit:1. Why do people kill each other?2. Who watches David Letterman?3. What makes people buy Linksys products?I know, I'm guilty of it too; I've owned three Linksys products, all of them failed one way or the other, but for some reason I kept coming back, faithfully believing in the brand. The WRT54G ver. 5 that I got turned out to be not much different in terms of quality and dependability.Linksys stuff has its appeal in that if it works, it works decently, this is why the lucky ones give it good reviews, but if you went through many of Linksys failures, you know what I'm talking about. First, the number one problem with WRT is that as a DHCP client it is extremely slow and dreamy - this is why most people experience "Internet could not be found" message during the installation - just give it a few minutes. Sometimes, the router locked up, and I couldn't even access its config page. The people who have experience Internet disconnects with DSL modems in full, non-bridged mode, may need to check the DHCP lease time of their modem, since as I've said, Linksys is slow when it comes to DHCP.I also wasn't impressed with it's two (!) big antennas - on the opposite side of my modest two-bedroom apartment I could barely get a connection from the laptop, no matter what channel I chose, time of day, or star alignment. The desktop just a room (mere feet and a dry wall) away from the router could get only 78%-85% signal, and the bars were constantly fluctuating, as if there was something wrong with the transmitter.In the end, after confirming my experiences from other users on the Net, I went back to Fry's and gave it back. I now have a U.S. Robotics MAXg router, which took me 5 mins to set up, and works like a Toyota - no suprises, just does what it supposes to. I downtuned its antenna power to 25% and I still get a decent reception everywhere around the apartment.So, if you value reliability and do not like surprises, do not buy Linksys.</review>

<review id="5474">TWO FAILED ACER LAPTOPS.  I hesitate to leave feedback like this, but I honestly think others should be aware of the quality issues I have experienced with Acer.  It's not only very irritating to receive defective merchandise, but a real hassle to return it, or try to get credit.Last fall I purchased an Acer laptop, the hard drive failed within a few weeks, I spent half a day repacking it, contacting Acer, searching for and making copies of the original receipts, and bringing it into the nearest FedEx shop to return it to Acer repair.  On October 28th of this year (2008) I purchased an Acer Aspire 1, 6 cell battery, 160 gb HD and 8.9 inch screen mini-notebook computer, it arrived within 48 hours, a very impressive ship time.  I wish I could provide a review of how it worked, but it never booted up.  As before, I spent an hour trying to contact Acer for service, in the process being put on hold three times.  When they agreed to take it back, only for repair, they also tried to get me to pay for return shipping! When it was done, I had spent an irritating half day making phone calls, repacking, and driving 30 miles to drop it off at the nearest FedEx office for return to Acer repair. I had purchased it through Amazon, but of course it went through a 3rd party.  It's really not fair to mention the actual seller, since the product was in a factory fresh, unopened box.  Although the actual seller offered to accept it for a return, I would have to pay a restocking charge of 15%! So, it was still cheaper to send it back to Acer.I noticed it was made in china, and had no quality control stickers anywhere, so who knows if it was inspected before, during, or after final assembly.</review>

<review id="5475">I got this router to replace my BEFSW11S4.Wired Desktop connected to the WRT54G worked immmediately.Problem: 2 out of my 3 wireless 802.11b adapters were not able to get the wireless link.A skyline Farallon (now Proxim) PCMCIA card: Linksys support recognized there is a compatibility problem with 802.11b device using a CISCO chipset.

<review id="5477">First, where did all of the reviews of this product go? Last time I checked the number was large and the consensus was fairly negative.With Mac sales up and MS always paranoid, did MS decide that the Mac version of Office could be released with reduced features and more bugs than usual? This software reminds me of what we endured the darkest days of Apple hardware/software in the mid-90s. As examples of feature cuts, Excel 2008 has neither Solver nor any of the analysis add-ins. Fairly simple operations in Excel, such as drawing a graph, sometimes now involve a substantial amount of time to complete. I can't recall the last time that attempting to draw a simple scatterplot produced a warning that due to the "complexity" of the graph, I might experience a long wait. Similar operations were essentially instantaneous in the 2004 version.The only thing I have found to like about the new Excel is the increase in the number of cells in the spreadsheet.In Word, as in the bad old days, simply scrolling is an adventure. The screen does not re-draw correctly even in a short document with simple formatting. Be careful about scrolling and then deleting. You may be very surprised by which portion of text disappears.I've been a Mac user since System 6, and I'm hard pressed to remember an "upgrade" this stripped of features and full of bugs.</review>

<review id="5478">It makes me sad that all these people are attributing their weight loss to a drug when they're really the ones doing all the work. If you look at the science behind this, the drug only blocks about 100 calories if you're adhering to the required diet (which is necessary). It's sticking to the diet that's yielding all these results, and all these people are doing that all by themselves. Perhaps the threat of having gastric distress adds additional motivation to stay on the diet, but any one of them could have done that without this pill.The drug doesn't even claim to increase your metabolism, or prevent storage. All it does is block 25% of the 45 grams of fat that you're allowed each day. That is literally 101.25 calories, about as much as you'll get from a single slice of cheese. That in itself can't double the weight loss results. The people using Alli are doing all the work and giving the pill all the credit.</review>

<review id="5479">First of all- extremely disappointed in Stephenie Meyer's latest attempt. I have been completely bewildered up unto this point as to why her novels have been getting progressively worse until I saw a very revealing interview in which Ms. Meyer commented that she "did not write Twilight for mass numbers of people to read...[she] doesn't know why people like it so much". This leads me to believe that Stephenie Meyer wrote Twilight for herself, and was thus true to herself. After its extradordinary- and relatively well-deserved- popularity, I think Ms. Meyer was simply at a loss between staying faithful to her characters and pleasing her audience. What she didn't realize, as few new authors do, is that the two must always go hand in hand. By attempting to make everyone happy, Stephenie Meyer has essentially destroyed the magic of the Twilight series, and has done so with particular prominence in this latest novel.I will avoid spoilers in this review- there are plenty with spoilers, if you're curious, and I would recommend that the casual Twilight reader borrow the book from the library in order to judge for yourself if Stephenie Meyer has ruined the books as badly as most people, including myself, believe. It's hardly a boring read; the essence of the characters is mangled beyond recognition, but Ms. Meyer at least keeps the reader hooked.For the more avid Twilight fan, however, I would highly recommend trying to avoid the hype and letting yourself end the novels at Eclipse. It's an interesting end to the stories, and the reader is hardly able to avoid inventing their own endings, probably far more true, in many cases, than the one created by Stephenie Meyer. I am currently working through my own close to the book, simply because I have grown to love Stephenie's characters, and I can't bear to see them thrown to the wasteside as they have been in Breaking Dawn. Do not spend money on this book. You will likely have a friend/local library that would be happy to lend you a copy if you're really curious, and I think it's far more fun to create an origianl ending in one's own head. My only hope is that, with Midnight Sun, Stephenie Meyer will not "write for us", but will instead write a novel for herself that we will then have the privilege to enjoy as we once did Twilight.</review>

<review id="5480">This is a very, very, very slow drive. I assume that Seagate is using a 5400rpm drive as one reason the throughput is so slow.I used this drive to backup 300GB of photos and image data. On a PowerMacG5 Quad with 4.5GB of RAM and this drive connected directly to the front USB port, speed averaged 348MB/min. Using EMC's Retrospect Express 6.1, the entire backup took 36 hours to perform, including verification of all the files.With the Xbench software, the drive earned a score of 14.41. By comparison, a 3-year old Western Digital 100GB ATA drive in an external Bytecc Firewire enclosure earned a score of 26.89.The speed difference between Firewire and USB 2.0 is not great enough to account for this difference.I guess Seagate engineers figured that there was no need to stick a fast drive in an enclosure that would be limited by USB 2.0's max speed; I suspect they picked a slower drive to reduce costs.The drive does get hot, but after using it around the clock for three days I have not (yet) experienced any problems with being able to access data on the drive.Those who have reported problems getting the drive to be recognized after using it for backups may be experiencing a known problem with Windows Vista and USB drives, not the Seagate FreeAgent Desktop drive. I have not had this problem with my Mac computer.I give the product two stars for the storage, cost, and ease of use -- but the slow performance precludes any higher score.If you need a big drive and can endure the slowness, then this drive may be okay. I haven't decided whether to keep it or pay a bit more for a faster drive in a faster enclosure.</review>

<review id="5484">I received the PetMate FreshFlow in November, 2005, and put it to work right away.  My wife and I have six cats, ranging from longhair to shorthair to haireverywhere, and I am pretty sure they all drank from it.  They became accustomed to it very quickly, the youngest being absolutely fascinated by it.  The entire time, I also had a high-capacity gravity-fed waterer in another room, so it wasn't the only source of water being used.Most noticible is that the FreshFlow is almost silent when the water is topped off, but if the water level falls, there is a very discernable motorized-gurgling noise.  This goes away as soon as you refill the reservoir tank by removing the lid, pulling out the tank (which reminds me a bit of a gerbil waterer on steroids), unscrewing the cap, filling it up, then doing all this in reverse; a 30-second process.The gurgling happens every day, and I would rinse the unit every couple/few days, and completely wash the unit out once every two weeks.  I also changed the filter regularly, at least once a month.  Beyond this, I made a point of pulling cat hair away from the little plastic screen in the water bowl, well, all the time.  In short, I thought I did a pretty good job in maintaining the equipment.  Any more than what I did, and honestly, I would rather buy surgical steel dishes and rotate them on a daily basis for the cat's use.Still, after taking the machine apart completely every few weeks to clean as instructed, the submersible pump failed after exactly 19 weeks and three days of use.  I liked the machine... when it was working.  I just purchased a pet fountain from a different company (I can't recall the make offhand... I should be receiving it soon) that ran in the $40 neighborhood, and I think it will be worth the extra money, but time will tell.  All in all, I don't think this purchase was worth it.  Maybe it's because of all the cats and cat hair, but for those of us at least who do have a multiple cat household, I think it's wise to consider buying a higher-scale unit.</review>

<review id="5485">I was disappointed at how much these sheets wrinkle in the dryer. I have purchased more reasonably priced bed sheets that were of better quality at half the price of what these were. I bought them because I liked the color, and the red is a very pretty, bright color. I would not recommend buying these unless you like to iron your sheets, or dry them on low heat. The material of the sheets is fairly thin, so I am not sure how long they will last.</review>

<review id="5486">I should say it did make great toast until the heating elements started working intermittently and unevenly. We bought this unit about two years ago to replace a broken cheaper "toaster oven" thinking that a more expensive digital convection oven would be better. Not so! The old toaster oven was great for heating pizza, broiling fish etc. A convection oven may be good for baking, but it doesn't broil, and before the heating elements started acting up we had talked about replacing it and we will now go back to a old style toaster oven which more suits our needs.</review>

<review id="5494">ACT! by Sage 2009 is, hands down, without a doubt, the absolute worst piece of software I've ever had the displeasure of using. It's completely non-intuitive, installation is nearly impossible, and there's an entire industry built up around it that purports to "assist" (for a fee, of course) with upgrading or converting previous ACT! databases to the most recent version. This program is snake oil, flat out. Our ACC (Act Certified Consultant) mentioned no less than four or five times during our consultation how likely it was that this wouldn't work, or that wouldn't work, that this would crash or that would crash. Of course, for an additional fee, everything would end up peachy keen. If you're considering using anything made by Sage, I highly recommend you run in the opposite direction as quickly as possible!</review>

<review id="5496">I bought this item based upon the mostly enthusiastic reviews here.  If I knew before I bought it what I know now I would not have bought it.  I have a Maine Coon cat, and even though I started regular grooming of her when she came to live with me at nine weeks old, she has never been happy about being combed/brushed.  I know; some cats apparently love it so much they will follow you around pestering to be groomed.  So, grooming is a challenge anyway and the FURminator is very unpopular with Meg and also with me to a great extent.  It does get out a fair amount more of hair than the regular grooming comb I have always used BUT it creates immense static electricity with the very first pass through the fur and it just keeps getting worse.  The hair drifts, in spite of me, onto my arms, clothes and face and it is nearly impossible to get it to stay on the towel that I use under Meg while grooming.  And, as far as the belly hair, tail hair, leg hair ---- forget about it!  Not going to happen.  So, when I finish using this wonder tool (ha!) I do a final comb-through with her normal grooming comb.  I hoped to reduce the vomiting of hairballs but the reverse has been true; she actually is throwing up hairballs several times a week instead of every couple of weeks.  So, I give the FURminator a thumbs-down.  I will continue to use it because I invested too much money, even at the Amazon price, to throw it away.</review>

<review id="5497">This is a great little MP3 player especially if you want to be moving while using it. Unfortunaley, there is a known problem with the player that Sandisk has not been able to fix with new firmware. At random times the sound will emit a crackle and skip (remember what a scratch did to your LP playback?). Sandisk customer support tried to help, but finally advised me to return the player if I was not satisfied. I used it for Audible books. I've tried two of these and both had the problem. Luckily Amazon is most gracious with returns.</review>

<review id="5498">I got the second book even though I didn't care for the first, just because I wanted to see where Meyers was going to take this series.  At first I really enjoyed the book, Bella's depression after Edward leaves was way over the top, but thankfully, that only took up one whole chapter, and not several.  Jacob was a life saver and not just to Bella, he actually makes the book worthwhile.  He is one of the only characters that really has a likeable personality, he's warm (figuratively and literally), caring, unselfish, and just the type of man you really would want to be with. I was really hoping that Bella would forget about Edward and cling to Jacob, but of course, just when she starts to realize that life with Jacob would be really good, Alice has to show up.  Then they have to go off on a dashing rescue mission to save Edward from his own stupidity and Bella leaves the only two true people in her life behind.  Of course Alice and Bella rescue Edward and return unscathed.  Then  the book goes downhill again.  Edward finally agrees to let Bella become a vampire as long as she marries him, and she refuses.  She doesn't want to get married to the boy she wants to spend eternity with?  I'm not sure what the author is trying to do here-discourage young marriages maybe-but it is so utterly rediculous.  On top of all this I do not understand either the author or her other readers fascination/obsession with Edward.  Compared to Jacob, Edward though beautiful has absolutely no personality, he's like those stereotypes of beautiful, big-breasted women with no brains, only in the masculine form.  Jacob on the other hand is warm, kind, funny, just an all around good guy who in Bella's own words is also beautiful.  The choice here is not difficult and yet Bella chooses Edward, and from some of the other reviews, readers do too, go figure.  I'm going to get the third book-when its cheaper, just because the author has left it open-ended just enough, that Jacob may still have a chance, and if he does, so does Bella and the author.</review>

Then, oh-lucky-me, I tried to look at it and repair if necessary with Apple's Disk Utility, and it said in bright red letters "Unable to verify disk" and the disk icon disappeared forever.  Returned the sucker the next day.  Now looking for a more compatible brand/unit.</review>

<review id="5501">Good for a few weeks. Now it starts to make loud girdling noises. Now the water seems to SLOWLY leak. Water ran well when I first got it but after a few weeks (3 weeks) the water seems to stop running (now only leaking drip by drip). The girdling sound is so loud that it scares my cat. I put enough water in this thing but I really do not know why the machine is not pump smoothly and powerfully even at max setting. Waste of money.</review>

<review id="5502">If you like your coffee steaming hot this is not the coffee maker for you.  I am very disappointed in this machine.  The user manual says that the water heats to 192 degrees, however when I tested the coffee coming out of the machine it is only 180 degrees.  I have to microwave every cup.  I called the Keurig tech and he said this is correct, it can lose 12 degrees by the time it gets to the cup.</review>

<review id="5503">I use to buy $1 knock off of famous cologne from the Dollar Store. That is when I got hooked on the clean, refreshing, but not over powering scents. But of course the scents didn't last long. So I plunked down my money and got Gio, the most I ever paid. I was scared I would over do it, you know, take a bath in it type smell. You know, I got no reaction, no one knew I was wearing it, so on I sprayed on more, and more. My daughter has alergies, when I get happy with the Old Spice lets me know it. She couldn't smell Gio. I mean my wife had to stick her nose on my neck a half an hour later to smell it. Yeah, I don't want to gas out a room with too much, but still this is a joke. I don't know if it was cut with alchohol or what, but I think it has to be thinned out. Bottom line, it smells great as you mist it on, like the smell. I am going back to Old Spice. What I am looking for is that "you smell great" when I am sitting next to my wife, with Gio, eh, can't tell I used it. I am a loyal, and frequent Amazon customer, overall good value for money, timely deliveries, it's not their fault.</review>

<review id="5504">As a now professional writer, Final Draft 4, 5 and 6 got me through the early screenplays, I have grown very fond of the program - my major "work tool".Final Draft 7 is a disgrace. Not only will you be wasting your money on an unusable product, you will spend hours of your time downloading and installing updates that fail, trying to optimise and "learn" a program that will let you down. I am actually amazed that a program that is so close to Version 6 (really, the only addition is the split screen thing...)is so far from that version in terms of stablity. What is up with this?We are talking about a program that is a BASIC word processor tailored to screen and stage writing - this isn't a complex 3d game!My strong advice is that if you feel you have to start with Final Draft, then purchace Version 6. (Still avalible - how many companies would keep an outdated version of their software on that market?) Otherwise look at the competitors.</review>

<review id="5505">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)      the fact that everyone thinks that heath ledger made a good joker is unbelievable it just shows that no one has seen the batman made in the early 90's starring jack nicholson, i will admit that christian bale has made some good movies (equilibrium for example) but this is sad that heath ledgers final performace was so bad.  the man is a good actor but his portrayel of the joker was completely and utterly wrong in keeping with the actual character from the comic books. he looks different acts different and does not use tactics as crude as the ones that they had him using in this farce</review>

<review id="5507">We are on our 3rd Cuisinart.  After 4 months the water did not drip through often requiring repressing on 2-3 times.  At this point the grinder basket does not lift out of the pot. It has to be forced up from underneath.  I love this coffee pot and wish the quality was consistent.  Cuisinart has not been responsive with complaints.</review>

<review id="5508">I ordered this toaster and had to return it for a new one because the toast kept burning on the lowest setting. The second toaster had the same problem! Because I don't have time or energy to deal with this issue again, we are just keeping an eye on the toast and popping it up early so it doesn't burn. What a pain! Also, when I called Cuisinart to let them know, they couldn't be bothered.</review>

<review id="5509">We purchased this 1 year and 1 week ago.  Love the functionality and got used to the look.  It gets used every single day.  We bought this more expensive oven since we thought it would last a long time.  The top element burned out 1 week after the warranty ran out!!! I am not very happy about having to buy another oven.  I'm sure I won't be able to convince my wife to buy another one like this.  Next time I read reviews I'll make sure to check if the item has some longevity.</review>

<review id="5510">I bought the Quicken Starter Edition because I thought it was replacing the least expensive Basic Edition this year. But Intuit failed to indicate that it was disabling the ability to accept data from earlier years. For that you have to upgrade to the more expensive Deluxe Edition. So the Starter Edition is absolutely useless for a long-time Quicken user. The only thing good I can say about this is that Intuit returned my money and I did not even have to return the CD. That deserves the one star I am giving this product.</review>

<review id="5511">After I backed up 250GB of data, the power supply failed.  I have had this drive for less than a week.  Seagate's podcast site also lists a customer who had the same failure.  This is still a new drive to the market, so I don't think this problem is being reported yet.  Buyer beware.  Otherwise, this is a great drive.</review>

<review id="5512">When this machine is working it's a charm, but suddenly, for no reason, the screen just stopped working. I called customer support and they told us to return it (they aren't open to give RMA numbers on the weekend though). Of course that will cost us additional for shipping, so this looks like it will be the gift that keeps on spending. I am not convinced, based on other comments that I've seen, that this is a reliable machine.</review>

<review id="5513">I'm a long-time Quickbooks fan and user, but 2009 is has some MAJOR issues that never should have made it past "beta testing." The online banking functionality is terrible compared to previous versions (I upgraded from 2008).I would pay $100 cash right now to be able to go back to 2008--the problem is that I've already entered too much data into 2009.Search the Quickbooks forums and you'll find some posts (including some by myself) about the online banking issues. It's a terribly done interface, very inefficient--not what I've come to expect from Intuit. I'm hoping they'll release a major upgrade to fix this, but judging by their lack of response to questions so far, I'm not holding my breath.</review>

<review id="5515">This review is from: Quantum of Solace [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)      "Quantum of Solace" is so incredibly bad, I can't even describe it. Everything about the movie is awful, from the lame opening sequence and crappy Alicia Keys theme song to the nonexistent storyline and pathetic excuses for Bond girls and villains. I won't even attempt to describe the plot because "Quantum" really doesn't have one, and every single new character introduced in this film is boring and annoying. It's a real shame, because this movie followed "Casino Royale," which is one of the best Bond films ever made. Daniel Craig makes an excellent James Bond, and it's not his fault that this film is a complete failure. The screenplay itself is a joke, and I don't think anything could have saved this movie. When I was sitting in the theatre, it didn't even feel like I was watching a Bond film...it was just another crappy action flick and a waste of the $19 I spent on two tickets. What a huge disappointment. I hope the producers get a fresh supply of working brain cells and make the next installment in the Bond series a decent one, or they'll be screwed.</review>

<review id="5516">The product tasted really really bad. My daughter hated it so much that she felt like throwing up the first time we applied it to her nails. We wanted to get rid of her finger sucking habit. Looked like it worked during the first 2 days but then she stopped worrying about the taste and started sucking her fingers more. Guess she understood we were trying to get rid of her bad habit and so started doing it more. Might be its good for older people biting finger nails but not so good for 2 year old kids.</review>

<review id="5517">Wall-E is not a movie that I enjoy watching. The images are too cluttered, and the words are sometimes hard to understand (even with my TV Ears). It seemed like I had to get half way through the movie before I began to comprehend the story.</review>

<review id="5519">In Feb 07, after reading horrible reviews of Norton and McAfee internet security software, I decided to go with the relatively untested Microsoft Onecare. I had no complaints until last week when Onecare failed to detect and remove a Trojan Downloader.  I spent hours running scans (one in safe mode) and all I got was a message saying it could not be removed-- all this despite assurances from Onecare technical support that it would correct the problem. The Trojan disabled my firewall and after the two unsuccessful scans, I spent another 3 1/2 hours on the phone working to restore the firewall. I'll have to say that Onecare technical support was patient and tried to resolve the issue but the fact remains that Onecare let me down.  I'm still having issues pulling up web pages.  For those thinking about Onecare, you might want to choose another security software program as I read Microsoft will no longer sell Onecare after June 2009. That speaks volumes.</review>

<review id="5521">When I say useless, I mean "unable to be used" not "has some quirky features I don't like"  It started out OK, but after about a month, it is broken.The problems started when I loaded about 1GB of music onto it.  I had 2 playlists, each with about 500MB of music.  The music would play fine, but switching playlists would take about 2 minutes.  That's right, with a flash player (ie. no moving parts), it would take a full 2 minutes for it to start playing a song when I changed playlists.  I don't know if it was due to number of songs per list or anything like that.  All I know is that it was totally annoying and completely ridiculous.When I got sick of it and looked on Sansa's website, I noticed they had a firmware upgrade.  So, hoping it was a bug that had been fixed, I ran their firmware updater.  IT CRASHED!!  My jaw nearly hit the floor when the updater crashed.  For those that don't know, an aborted firmware update is the equivalent of a lobotomy for an electronic device.  For what it's worth, the player worked for another day, but then just quit after that.I plugged it into the computer to sync some music, and it was not recognized.  So, I unhooked it and replaced the battery, hoping to clear whatever snafu was happening.  Since that (1/2 hour ago), I've been staring at the Sansa bootup screen, hoping against all hope that it will eventually spring to life.I wanted a good quality, non-iPod mp3 player.  Simple, easy, and inexpensive.  The m250 is none of these, considering that you'll end up throwing it in the trash and buying something else.  Save yourself the trouble and get something worthwhile.</review>

<review id="5525">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      Don't get me wrong, it's not a totally terrible movie, but this movie is pretty incoherent.

The highlight performance of the joker is okay, better than others, it is creepy in a clown sort of way, but slightly overrated.</review>

<review id="5526">Its exactly that! It's one of those crummy used cars that seems okay just long enough to go beyond the return warranty. Now, I'm stuck with over $100 worth of junk (the router + the card). It seemed fine, despite the ridiculous customer service helpline, but then problems emerged daily. Just like many other users, my connection would break, it would act like it never seen my computer before to the point that I would have to repeatedly take it apart and reconnect the wire setup. I went from Verizon DSL to Comcast Internet and it just got worse. If you have dialup, Linksys will somehow always "forget" your username, password, settings, etc. and if you have broadband, it will pretend that a network is a figment of your imagination! Wireless is nice but its not worth the aggrivation and that's only if it works. Again, the first time I tried to connect to my campus network, everything clicked and I even could access the lab printers. Then every time after that, I kept getting cut off from the net...AND THEY USE THE EXACT SAME LINKSYS ROUTERS!!! Don't buy this, please. Its just not worth it!</review>

<review id="5529">My wife had wanted one of these for years and so I got her this for Christmas. It was amazing that one day after the 30 day return date the mixer stopped working. The motor would hum but the mixer would not turn. It was only used maybe three times. So now I have to contact the manufactuer for service. I would highly recommend buying from a local retailer if you wanted to purchase one of these so you could check it out before buying. Now I am in the doghouse until I can get it replaced for my wife.</review>

<review id="5531">This machine blows hard directly out of the popping chamber, meaning it will leave very little mess behind. 10-20 kernels always fly out before it even begins popping.  And once it starts popping, some very hot kernels fly out, only to pop inside the popcorn bowl, throwing popcorn all over the place.  The plastic gets hot enough to become noticeably soft.My old machine blew sideways, creating a vortex inside that did not allow unpopped kernels to escape. The only drawback was having to pour the remaining contents out of the machine after it was done popping, but that's nowhere near as bad as having to pick up popcorn off the floor like you have to do with this device.</review>

<review id="5532">I purchased this device at Best Buy.  I paid the extra money, because of the lure of the 3GB/s data transfer rate.  I was EXTREMELY disapointed when I realized that the ACTUAL data transfer rate will NEVER exceed about 60 MB/s.  I discovered that after being on hold with customer service for about 45 minutes.  As the member of tech support informed me, the transfer rate tops out at about 60MB/s.  However, that is ONLY if you are transferring files that are several gigabytes in size.  If you are transferring a bunch of small to medium sized files, you will get the crappy performance that I received, which equates to a data transfer rate of 3-12MB/s.  The 3GB/s, as stated by tech support, is only a THEORETICAL data transfer rate that MAY be available when solid state drives become available.  It would be nice if this tid bit of information were on their website, or their packaging.To their credit:I purchased this device for a windows PC.  Speaking of which, there was no information inside of the box for how to format the drive for windows (why put a windows logo on the outside of the box if you're not going to show how to make it pc ready on the inside???)  However, one quick call to tech support showed me how to get it up and running in like 5 mins.  Makes me wonder why I had to wait 45 minutes today.Bottom line, I gave them 1 star, because had I known what I know now, I would not have spent the money to buy this drive to try and get an unattainable transfer speed.  With that transfer speed, it will take like 6-8 hours to back up my laptop.  That means that I'll be backing up my HD like once a year :(</review>

<review id="5534">First of all, lemme say i have never written a bad review like this before and i don't do it lightly.I wouldn't recommend buying this product at any price. It's basically defective by design. Here's the issues:1. They use a propeller type water pump which means it clogs easily and doesn't bleed the air out automatically. When air gets into a water pump system is "chatters" like garbage disposal. The loud sound makes it a poor choice if it's going to be in normal living quarters.2. Because the propeller pump and setup clogs easily they had to make it easy to take apart for cleaning. The problem is that it also makes it leak easily. They also say in the instructions that not cleaning voids warranty. So you have to take it apart, put it back together AND THEN recheck, refit to prevent leaking each time you clean it.3. The switch designed to control the speed of the water flow isn't a switch at all. It doesn't slow water pump, it bottlenecks the water intake. This bottleneck valve causes water turbulence which cause more air bubbles to get into system for more noise.The price doesn't matter ... the only way this product is usable in a normal home room is if you remove water bottleneck valve completely. Then you should also replace the water pump with an inline pump. That's $40 bucks for a new pump plus all the time it's gonna take you to retrofit the new pump and line.Basically doubling the price of this Drinkwell product.i suppose if your going to put it in a basement or garage where leaking and noise don't matter, then this could work. But a noisy and leaky pet bowl doesn't work in any normal home room.</review>

<review id="5535">I have an iron obsession, and YES i loved the CHI when I first received it, but then it just stopped working. The cord wires wouldnt make contact inside the iron and i had to start holding the cord on a 45deg angle to get it to work... then that approach stopped working.  I took the thing apart and fixed it, but then it happened again. So i bought another Chi. After about 3 months, the same thing happened with the cord. I didnt feel like taking it apart again, so I bought the Chi turbo - i was afraid to Stray from Chi, because I loved the results.  And then after 3 months The Turbo stopped working.... 3 iron, all with the same problem... I'm done with Chi...</review>

<review id="5540">This was a wonderful kitchen appliance for about 2 weeks. Then it stopped working. I would rather pay moremoney and get a longer lasting unit than settle for this cheap piece of junk. I thought Cuisinart was supposedto be a good brand. It couldn't whip my cottage cheese, keffir and flax oil concoction without burning out. (We'retalking about the consistency of yogurt here...)I hope Cuisinart re-tools this thing because it could be a really handy kitchen gadget if it had a long life.This is the first online review I've ever done.

<review id="5541">In spite of a thread warning of problems saving videos on this device, I decided to give it a try. Sadly, they were right. The first couple of videos I took (very short) worked well and I had no problems transferring them from the device to my computer. Yesterday my daughter had her Christmas concert and I took 9 short videos. I tried twice to transfer them from the program - "program error" resulted and asked me to restart the program. Attempted this twice, and had to restart my computer both times! I then decided to just try copying them straight from the device onto my computer (which I'm trying without any luck right now). It appears that these videos (or the last 6 of them anyway) will be stuck on the device with no way to retrieve them. I am VERY unhappy and wish that I had just erred on the side of caution and not purchased this device. Needless to say, I'm returning it for a refund and will instead go with a "real" camcorder which will only be a few dollars more and hopefully will work as advertised... I'm not looking for "perfect" just a functional way to record special moments.</review>

<review id="5542">Very disappointed in this version of Quicken. I'V been a Quicken user for years on my PC and when I went over to a Mac I thought thier version would be similar.

Best part of the deal is Intuit has a 60 day money back policy to take advantage of.</review>

<review id="5543">Good gosh.As many other reviewers have stated, I ADORED Twilight.New Moon was okay for me.But Eclipse...was a mountain of dissappointment.The two stars was for the fact that it did keep my attention.Badly, but it held it.Stephanie Meyer is not a good writter by any means. Her writting style is mediocre at best; at times it seems like reading fanfiction. But I've always forgiven it, because I loved the romance and love between Edward and Bella in Twilight. I prefered the storyline to be good, rather than the actual writing itself.But with Eclipse, everything lost it.Here are my major problems:Edward and Bella were amazing. I wish that Bella's relationship with Jacob would remain strictly platonic. Her love for him did nothing for the story, except make it painfully obvious, that Bella is just, well, to put it simply, dumb. Ms. Meyer states that because of the fact that Bella has chosen Edward over Jacob, that their love is pure. Yeah it could have been if only it didn't seem like Bella was being forced to pick him.Bella. Bella. Bella. I'm sure if you are reading these reviews that you know most readers problems with Bella already. Selfish, bland, ect. What truly bothers me about her, putting Edward issues aside, is the whole marriage thing. I'm not agreeing that 17 year olds should get married. But in their situation, in which Bella has decided to become a vampire, in fact, insisted on it, she can't even do this one thing for him. She has to make a big deal out of it, as if it would be the worst thing in the universe to happen. She consistantly states that all the things she does is for other people. I feel it is Ms. Meyer defending her. Because, in my opinion, all of her actions show no concern for anyone.Edward. The only thing I have to say about him is, maybe you should listen to Bella. You are way too good for her. I was in love with the idea of them. But now, I think he'd be better off if he'd leave.And Jacob? If we were supposed to like him.Wow.That's all I can say.4th book? Will I be reading it? Yeah.Am I expecting to be happy with it? No.But I have to find out how this ends. Because as of right now, I feel Bella and Edward's relationship is ruined. And wasn't that the whole point of this series? Yeah, they can make amends. But she cheated on him. Cheated!I don't think things can ever be truly fixed.This is no special love story between two soulmates.It's a teenage drama now.And goodness knows there is way to much of that stuff out there.</review>

<review id="5544">This is by far the worst book of the series. Barely any plot, or character development, the book is driven by the facial expressions. "I grimaced." "He grimaced." "My eyebrows pulled together." "The corners of his lips curled up slightly." "I snorted." The word "grimace" must have been used 300 times in this book, and used as a verb! Meyer limits the already shallow characters to expressing their emotions by a few changes in the face. If people did what these characters did in real life, people would think they had some kind of facial tic. This really drove me crazy; I considered having someone read the 4th before me just to cross all that stuff out. And does anyone else get the feeling of redundancy, across all the books? Like they have the same conversations over and over again, and never get over anything? I have a feeling she wrote this in a hurry to make money for her publishers.</review>

<review id="5545">It's three days past finishing the first book of this saga and I'm done with number two.  It still feels like a train wreck.My suspension of disbelief is entirely strained to the point of breaking because the fantasy portion of these books barely holds water (okay, the first book was better, but the werewolf stuff in this book was frankly not that interesting at all...not for the characters, not for the reader).While the first of this series has all the tension of forbidden love and some creepy people chasing after Bella, this second book lacks much of the substance, if you can call it that.Again, we're trapped in Bella's head, and now she's unbelievably depressed.  Oh but I believed it, because I, like many others, have been there done that in our youths.  With that said, do I really want to go there in someone else's head for two hundred pages?  I kept reading, clinging to hope there was a story.The relationship with Jacob is hardly a teaser as it's clear where Bella's mind and heart lie, she tells us ever moment.  I mean heck, she's threatening her own life just to induce auditory hallucinations of her true love....yeah, she's desperate--for most of the book.(Slight spoiler) What made me reel in disgust toward the end was a little speech by Edward chastising Bella for so easily believing him when he said he didn't love her anymore.Great, so this was really all Bella's fault for not fighting?Okay, I, and many ladies I know, have heard such lines in our lives from men and it makes us crazy angry to have the table flipped over without due cause.  But Bella, is like "Oh, I was a fool wasn't I?"Seriously, whatever charm the characters possessed for me in the first book was obliterated. However, I did like Alice even more as well as Jacob.

<review id="5546">Like all linksys "cheap" routers, this is great and easy to use and all that jazz and deserves its stars. However, if you use BitTorrent for anything and/or need a lot of connections (you know, like if you play World of Warcraft and like to use the default method of downloading patches) *skip* this router. It can not deal with a high number of connections! Maybe this is something that can be fixed with 3rd party firmware, but out of the box using BitTorrent will choke this router.</review>

<review id="5547">I bought this adapter for my daughter's desktop PC in the hopes of obtaining a decent range.  I had an old wireless "B" PCI adapter from Netgear for years, and signal was always very marginal on this PC.I also bought a Linksys WRT600N router to upgrade my whole wireless system too.  The idea of dual band 2.4/5Ghz seemed attractive enough.  Also, I thought that by buying from the same manufacturer I should have very few issues.I have four PCs at home 3 x wireless "G" (XP SP3 + Vista SP1 + MAC)+ 1 x wireless "B" (XP SP3), so this USB Wireless "N" computer would have been the only one capable of all the extra features and range.The installation of the USB adapter software went fine and it connected almost right away.  So I thought I was done.  Almost immediately my daughter started complaining of lost connection issues.  I blamed it on her finagling with the wireless software, but it turned out that she was right.  The system would take a long time to connect after booting up the PC, then would disconnect after 2 or 3 minutes, and would connect again may be 30 min later.  I could not manually force a connection (even though Linksys software advisor would say that I was connected to the router).To summarize, I called tech support today and was pleasantly surprised to speak to a human after no more than 2 minutes.  But after 50 min on the phone, and several holds while he was in turn asking questions to somebody else, he came back saying that I'd be better off returning the USB adapter and getting a Linksys WMP300N which he swore is a dual radio band (even though I read somewhere that it works at 2.4 GHz only).Too bad I bought this online, but it was from Amazon, so I am returning it today.</review>

<review id="5548">I would not recommend this bread machine. The following things I have found that are not good?No 1 The loaves are very uneven unless you catch it on the rise time and straighten out the dough.No 2 The dough balls up on one paddle only while mixing. So much for two paddles.No 3  The paddle comes off too easily. Even comes off sometimes while the bread is mixing.No 4 The pan is very touchy to insert in the mixer.  Has to be  JUST right for it to work,No 5 The beep sound is very weak and you have to stay in kitchen to hear it to add fruit, ect.No 6  It is too costly as compared to other brands.</review>

<review id="5549">Life is too short to deal with the horrible customer service provided by Linksys.  I bought this product and had trouble setting up my network.  I called the customer support department, and after waiting on hold for 40 minutes, I was told &quot;Sorry, can't help you.  We are not specialized enough to help you with a network,&quot;!  Not only that, but they couldn't even give me a number for someone who could.  Unbelievable.This wireless network had replaced a Dell wireless network and I am sorry I ever changed.  Dell really does have the best customer service department in the industry.Again, don't waste your time with Linksys.</review>

<review id="5550">I was all excited to give this product a try only to find that I couldn't even load it on my new Toshiba laptop with the Vista operating system.I tried twice to load it onto my laptop without success. After going to the manufacturer's (Nuance) website, I found out that the program is not compatible with 64-bit operating systems...Are you kidding me??!!??This was supposed to be the most recent version of this software. After reading the system requirements printed on the box more closely, I noticed that it does say that the 32-bit Vista operating system was supported. Well for those of us who aren't computer experts, it'd be nice if the manufacturer clearly labeled the box with "PRODUCT NOT COMPATIBLE WITH 64-BIT VISTA OPERATING SYSTEM"-- since most of us expect software to work with ALL versions of an operating system when it's listed as a supported operating system. Who even knew that there were 2 versions of the Vista operating system.So if you've got a newer computer, make sure you check which version of Vista you are running before buying this software!!!</review>

<review id="5551">and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling." Creative Labs and Amazon know that many Vados are purchased for children.

<review id="5552">I honestly don't know why this gets such great reviews.   As stated by others, it leaks litter all over the floor when you roll it.  Then, if you don't do it every day, the litter clumps can get too big and then get jammed in the pull-out tray (maybe that is a result of the cheap scoopable stuff I used?)   Also, it doesn't hold very much litter and the sliding latches that hold the box closed are cheap and jam easy.Back to scooping for me until I can justify a robot!</review>

<review id="5553">I bought this one last month.The oven worked great but the toaster would come on and go right back off. I sent it back and received a replacement. The toaster worked perfect. The oven only worked on the two lowest tempertures. Talked with Amazon and they suggested I not try for three bad ones in a row. Great to do business with Amazon. As for Sanyo.........</review>

<review id="5554">We had this coffee brewer just over a year when it started not allowing the water to enter the pot, just steamed it away. I tried cleaning every orifice available and removed the charcoal filter and still no coffee would brew.  All we got was steam.  We only used it occasionally for family parties and such and at this price, it is a shame that it didn't function for very long. I will never buy another cuisinart piece of junk again!</review>

<review id="5555">I am very disappointed in the range of this wireless product.  My old router (G) had a much better range and speed.</review>

<review id="5556">These sheets are...very thin, you can see the pattern of the floor through this.  If your looking to protect the floor from spit ups and spills this will never do. They are loose fitting which I feel makes them a safety hazard.  For a couple dollars more, you can...buy a two pack of pack and play sheets made by Little Tykes.  The Little Tykes sheets have elastic on the corners to keep the sheet snug.  They are softer and thicker.  And are well worth the money.  I wish I had never purchased these Graco ones.</review>

<review id="5558">Again only 5 channel audio for such a huge release.  The studios are really getting lazy and putting out trash.  For this reason alone I cannot take Blu-ray seriously.  Until we start really utilizing the technology this format is a lost.  I'd expect at least a DTS ES 6 channels or ideally full 7 channel HD audio.  For this reason I would suggest people boycott buying these HD formats simply because the studios and Sony are ripping people off.</review>

<review id="5559">Based on positive reviews, I bought this waffle maker.  The first thing I noticed was how cheap the adjustable setting slider was.  Cheap and plastic.  It's so loose, I couldn't even tell which setting it was on.  Cooking was inconsistent as a result of this design flaw.  After a few weeks, the slider broke.I exchanged it for another of the same model.  This new one had the same design flaw.  In addition, the new one kept burning waffles.  I returned it, too.I will look for a different waffle maker.</review>

<review id="5560">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      I LOVED Twilight...so I was so excited to read New Moon. Boy was I disappointed. I don't understand what she was thinking in taking the Cullens out for 3/4 of the book. The Cullen are what make your series. No wonder New Moon is almost everyones least favorite. If you want to break up Edward and Bella for drama purposes, thats fine...but don't have them move out of town and expect some boring wolf story with some kid to take their place. It's not going to work. I thought that maybe with Edward gone, this was her change for Bella to grow the hell up, but no she didn't even do that. Instead she just latched herself onto someone eles. Also can someone please tell why we are surpost to care about the jerky little kid who so rudly cut in on a dance. The moment the kid starts saying to his cult that you are his girlfried, Bella should have cut ALL ties with him and hang out with your girlfriends.</review>

<review id="5561">This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      Americans are fat, lazy and we are ruining the earth...did Disney really need to make a film about that? I found it really condesending that the only "fat people in space" were Americans!  I really don't think we need to be sending THAT message around the world especially in a cute little Disney vehicle called Walle.... Sure there is redemption in the end but only in still shots like the animators were "mailing it in" and didn't really want a happy ending. I can't be the only one with that take on the flick.</review>

<review id="5562">I concur with many of the reviews that say this shaver does not provide a close shave. It is very expensive, but does seem very well made. I will only use it for travel and will rely on a blade and shaving cream when at home.</review>

<review id="5563">Heaven forbid--somebody's giving this fabulous item one star!  Forgive my rebellion, but I was truly disappointed with the Furminator and can not agree with everybody's raves about it.  I do agree with this product's claim that it removes a lot of hair--but perhaps too much if you like your animal to have a nice thick coat or a beautiful, fluffy tail.  And it's SO messy to use, which you don't find out until you actually get it home and use it--I was surrounded by floating patches of fur that stuck to everything BUT the comb.  The fur goes directly from your cat...to YOU.  If you're allergic, use a mask!  I tried to keep the fur confined, but static electricity caused most of it to float away or stick to me as the fur doesn't come off in bunches but sits on the top layer of fur after each stroke.  You can gather it up after each stroke, but static electricity will be your enemy when you try to put the fur in the trash.  My long-haired Burmese did NOT like it; it removed about half the fluff from his magnificent tail and pulled on or got tangled in his fur no matter now gently and evenly I combed.  My short-haired cats didn't mind it so much; but again, the loose hairs flew away no matter how closely I read the directions and used long, steady strokes; their tails are now half the thickness and look like fuzzy rat tails.  Be very careful around the tail area and keep the strokes even--or just avoid the tail completely!  I had to vacuum extensively afterward;  fur flying EVERYWERE--not as easy to use as you'd think.  I prefer and recommend the standard metal-bristle brushes;  they remove a lot of fur--without pulling or cutting--which stays on the brush in a clean bunch for easy cleaning.  And they don't turn your cats into rats.  WHY IS THIS PRODUCT SO EXPENSIVE???</review>

<review id="5564">Vista has a twin, and its name is Office 2007.  And I'm embarrassed to admit I failed to do the research I should have done, and typically thoroughly do before buying anything.  Yes, it got me.  I was lulled by thoughts of, "I know Windows and Office applications like the back of my hand--how different could it possibly be?"  And why shouldn't I think that given the compatibility and cohesion of past Office versions? Like many I'm sure, even with new or updated MS products I've pretty much always been able to, at the very *least*, intuit and immediately execute core commands--read: effective and efficient productivity right out of the box.  Well, that party has come to a brutal ended with the Office '07 suites. With its completely new interface (within which the same user-friendly Office functions we've all come to know and love are purportedly buried), MS has released a product I've found to be astoundingly unintuitive and difficult to learn (i.e., nowhere near worth the time it would take to figure out), not to mention incredibly slow to run.  Then, once I started to get the hang of the method to their madness a little bit, my feeble hopes were quickly dashed when I discovered there to be MINIMAL ability to customize menus, toolbars, buttons, functions, etc such that I could better take advantage of said "improvements".  Can't wait to see the new TV commercial Mac will inevitably come up with to mock this mock-worthy software.  Don't get me wrong folks, overall I'm a big PC/MS/Win/Office fan.  But, wow, for these and other troublesome reasons already described elsewhere, this one has left me utterly stunned.</review>

<review id="5565">I have used turbo tax for 11 years now and have always been pretty happy with it.  I was a little iritated over the years that there are always some suprise fees for efile, state returns, etc, but is still seemed like a good value.  Now it has reached $59.95 + $15 to efile the state return. The thought of paying almost $75 has finally forced me to look somewhere else.  It is brave to jack up the price in the middle of the biggest recesion in modern history.  This year they were going to charge just for printing your return, but changed thier mind after all the negative feedback.  Too bad there is not someone at Intuit that could realize what makes people mad without first trying to trick people.  So after 11 years, I have done a bunch of research and am going to give TaxAct a try as it is only $20 for federal, state and efiles.</review>

<review id="5566">This shaver only does a good job if I literally shave every day.  If I skip a day or two (which I often do), then forget it... it will miss half of the hair it goes over with each pass meaning I have to make 10+ passes with my skin pulled taut on every part of my face making sure I try passing in different directions and with the razor held just right before there's even a chance that I'll have gotten everything.  Even then I'll find some missed hairs that I have to go back with the beard trimmer or my manual razor and tackle.It ends up taking twice as long to shave with this than with my Mach 3, and again often times I just end up doing a touch up with the Mach 3 after spending way too long with the Pulsonic 9595.So really this razor only conveniences me in the least when I'm shaving daily which I don't really care to do since my beard comes in pretty light and slow and I can pass the light scruff look for a day or two between shaves.Oh, also the stupid cleaning fluid sensor has been telling me it's 'low' since about the second time I cleaned it, and has told me a few times now that it's empty despite the fact that when I remove the fluid canister, it's still over half full.  It will not self-clean when it thinks it's empty so I have to tilt it forward to fool the sensor, then hit the button while it's fooled, and then put it back on the counter.What a waste of money this was!</review>

<review id="5567">I went through 3. Yep, and all three went on to have the "ticking/skipping" sound when I turned up the volume. It wasn't the earphones. It wasn't the format of the songs: it comes with sample songs on which I tested the volume. Then I look this little flaw up in google and one forum says that Sandisk is "working on it." Nice, well while they work on it this player is heading back to the store. Buy this with a warranty, just in case.</review>

<review id="5569">I just started to do my taxes with this product. A product I have used for years. I can tell you that after 3 hours I am bearly begun. In the past I would be almost finished. It does not import the data from QuickBooks,their own product, which is why I am bearly started.I do not know what has happened but I suspect that the people who knew how to produce a good product were let go in a cost cutting move. I might have to buy another product to do my taxes this year because this product absoultely stinks compared to what they offered previously. Just check out their help section. What you will find is customer's posting problems with no answers. I just hope they did not screw up the home taxes as well as I have bought that program as well. I have been using QuickBooks for 10 years and TurboTax for 7 years so I am no novice.</review>

<review id="5570">I've owned multiple 500gb My Book external drives with no problem.The 1 TB external drive has given me problems since the beginning.It literally shuts itself off during use multiple times per day.  I don't mean after long periods of non-use.  I mean right in the middle of opening and/or saving files. I've contacted Western Digital over the issue they sent me patch which did nothing.  I highly regret this purchase.  I would suggest staying with the 500gb drives.</review>

<review id="5571">I had that toaster for 10 days and could never get it to toast properly. On a low setting of just 3 then on each piece of toast one side was badly burnt while the other side was acceptable. Then at a 2 setting one side would be OK but the other side wasn't even tan and barely dried! I gave up and called the 800 number and complained. The service rep told me they have had many problems with that model. I'm not an engineer, but the problem is the center coils have twice the number of heating wires than what the outsides have. Pretty obvious why it's a piece of junk. Steer clear of that toaster!!!</review>

<review id="5572">I bought this product to use for our home daycare business and it was not easy to use at all.  I ended up sending everything to our accountant when Turbo Tax estimated that we owed thousands in taxes. We did owe, but our accountant came up with a figure approximately $3000 less than Turbo Tax did.  I am not an accounting major but I do have a strong math background and I always did our taxes before we had our own business but this product confused and stressed me out totally.</review>

<review id="5573">We have two PC's and one Macbook Pro with wireless connections to this router. The Windows computers work fine with it, (usually) without a hitch but my Mac mostly has problems with it. Web pages usually do not load the first time.

<review id="5574">Product was dead on arrival.  I wish I could simply return it, but I had to exchange it through warranty.  I haven't received my replacement yet... my fingers are crossed!ALSO, know that in order to plug in the second USB for additional power you need 2 USB ports close to one another.  Many computers have this, of course, but unfortunately my  Mac Powerbook G4 has one USB port on the left, one on the right.  The cord doesn't reach that far.</review>

<review id="5575">Within 2 hrs of applying this product to my 2 year old 19 lb healthy dog, he began shaking, crying and scratching out-of-control.  After 3 days, 2 baths, 2 trips to the Vet and one steriod injection by the Vet, his skin is still red and appears to have a chemical burn on the site of application.  He still has sudden bursts of pain causing him to cry, shake and pant heavily.  The manufacturer was contacted by the Vet and while they are aware of this type of adverse reaction, they provided little information for treatment or duration.If you choose to use this product, watch your dog carefully and be ready to act quickly if you notice any discomfort.</review>

<review id="5576">Very powerful story that merits attention to yet another LAPD scandal....LMN channel level storyline perhaps, but big screen??? Imagine that Clint and Ron got the red carpet treatment for a below par screenplay.  Ken Burns would have done a much better job but then less of an audience unless they exaggerate all the blood spilling, electric shock therapy, and evil looks of the protaganists.  I liked the skating at work deal, Angelina just has to keep pursing those SCREAMING TOMATOE RED lips that distract from anything else going on in the scene and if anyone considers her a feminist because she is forced to work and a minister pretty much takes up her case, I dunno, not buying it.  I think this entire genre of "Where's my son/daughter/family member" is not striking the chord as much as desired, LAPD is prolly worse now...justice served selectively, minorities treated poorly unless Gloria Allred is sleuthing nearby.  Quite frankly, a woman with 6 kids should be home taking care of her family and she is just the wrong talent for this vehicle of compassion for a parent.  My sympathies to the family that endured such painful experiences.  I imagine they had no desire to dredge all that up again.</review>

<review id="5577">This review is from: Pinocchio (Disney Gold Classic Collection) (DVD)      This certainly is not one of my favorite Disney movies.

Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie... just read the book and you will take away with it a wonderful message. If you watch the movie, the message is lost.</review>

<review id="5579">I purchased the Pesto PopLite Hot Air Popcorn popper as a replacement and am looking to get a refund. The kernals fly out unpopped even if you preheat the popper. The instruction manual says you have to use gourmet popcorn which adds to the cost. Also have to pop 1/2 cup popcorn to get anything popped and that makes over 14 cups popcorn. Can't make small amounts for a snack. Very poorly engineered. I would have rated this 0, but it was not available.</review>

This piece of junk cannot and will not replace the consistency of just using a knife.</review>

<review id="5584">A cap does not tightly close the USB mouth. This increases a likelihood of losing the cap (not surprisingly, if you go to Corsair website, one of the most frequent request is to get a cap). Dust can gather around the mouth if the cap is lost, which potentially damages the USB drive or shortens the life. I indeed lost a cap at some point, not because of my forgetfulness but because of this particular design defect if you will. I gave one star mainly because the USB drive failed to function after less- than-a-year use. After submitting the case online, sending the broken USB drive, and getting a new replacement, I have an impression that a Corsair customer service is not well streamlined. For example, I expect them to repair the broken USB drive, but they did replacement only, which disabled me to retrieve the lost data. Anyway, if it happens to you, call them instead of submitting the case online, and tell them exactly what you want them to do.</review>

<review id="5585">This product has some good features, but the home/student version will not let you e-mail from it, you have to save it first and then e-mail from your email program.

<review id="5588">I was very dissapointed in my purchase of this product.  As I'm writing you all this review, I've been on the phone with Liksys for over 2hrs trying to get an explanation why the advertised USB connection, advertised as i.e. available for external storage device, is not being detected by my Laptop (This is what was most appealing to me about the product).  Not only has this been terribly time consumming, but at the price ($189) I do not expect to run into these kind of troubles.  I have been a very satisfied customer using Linksys products in the past but this aftercare service by Linksys tech support and non-functional product has driven me to inform all of you that care to know, to be very aware that this product and it's representatives are not all they promise to be.  Their tech support is seperated by levels, the higher the level the more knowledgable they are supposed to be - not so!  They couldn't even realize 2hrs into the conversation after having asked me already that I was working of Windows Vista!  Back to the router :-)  The range is not all that grand for a supposed 5ghz router.  I use it for gaming as well and have not found any problems with it.  When I move my laptop around however, just a good 10+ yds from the router and you can loose some serious speed.  So again, be wary about this one.  For the price there has to be a better router than this...ideas are definitely welcomed, especially if anyone knows of a router that has the capability to allow USB connections....</review>

<review id="5589">Main problem seems to be that pricing varies daily.  Then its questionable as to what you get / dont get.  My comments on this dont even seem to get posted, like other prior (foaming?) negative accounts ($37 vs $47).  Intresting the boxed set is now $42 compared to $47 download (thats if you get the same product..who knows anymore).Im intending on using the competition H&R Block or even going back to paper forms, the only way to really vote is by not buying.  If enough people do this, perhaps next year TT will understand the need for straightforward pricing and product.</review>

<review id="5591">My daughter got this pot for a wedding present four years ago and I think it makes wonderful coffee and is worth the trouble to clean it.  She has never had a problem with the pot and she does not do anything special to keep it clean.I got the plastic version myself to save money and it lasted a year or two and the plastic broke so I decided to get this one inspite of the bad reviews.I had it two months when it leaked on the counter -- clear water from under the pot (Cuisinart said a water pipe was leaking).  I called Cuisinart and they said I had to send the old one back (at my expense) and they would send me a new one because it has a three year warranty.  I waited for the new one to come so I would have a box for the old one and I have been too busy to send the old one back because the return instructions were so complicated.Today the new one leaked also  -- I have been using it about three weeks.I just called Cuisinart and told them not to bother sending another one and that I was not sending either of these back  -- that I am putting both of them in the trash.  They would not give me a refund.I called Amazon and they will not give me a refund either because it is later than 30 days on the first one and I got the second one directly from Cuisinart. I loved the pot and I do not know why Cuisinart cannot make a coffee pot that actually works.  I would have been willing to buy a  new one every year or two just to have this pot, but not send one back every other month for three years.</review>

<review id="5592">This DVD is designed for those who are comfortable with wealth--actually don't realize they have immense material wealth.  The glitz is appalling.  If you have begun your spiritual journey, you know that the path is personal. The "Secret" is one-size-fits-all.  If you must access this item--it can all be summed up in "what you sow is what you reap"  The tendency to present the Secret as some hidden wonder capable of making one rich, sexy and satisfied may not be what was intended but it comes out loud. I'm embarrassed I wasted the money--and morally cannot pass the item along, since it is not helpful.</review>

<review id="5593">We have a coonhound and a poodle.  The coonhound was barking a lot when we were away and disturbing the neighbors.  We thought this would be a great solution to stop her from barking without having to hurt her or disturb anyone else.  We didn't think about the affect on the poodle who was not causing any of the problems.  When she would bark, it would go off, but she didn't care she just kept on barking.  Meanwhile, inside the house the poodle could also hear the noise because we had to set it on the 50 foot range setting.  He started acting really weird and hiding all the time, afraid that he would hear that noise again.  We used this for less than a week and then decided to return it.  Nice idea, but it didn't work for us.  We ended up purchasing the lemon spray anti-bark collar for the coonhound and so far that has been working great, she is barking A LOT less.</review>

<review id="5594">This ipod is now freezing up and is past the very short 30-day return window that Amazon offers. I will never buy a big-ticket item from Amazon again. I will buy from another store that has at least a 90-day return policy, like Walmart. Very unhappy!</review>

<review id="5595">I got this for a Maltese and add it to his food as the product suggests. My dog stopped eating for two days, he could not come near his food once this medicine is added to his food. It looks like not all dogs will accept to eat it!!! So i got nothing out of it.</review>

<review id="5596">Here i sit with my 1 1/2 year old Japanese Chin 8 hours after Advantix application.  When the time came for us to have quiet time, she came to my lap and i noticed she was shivering and staring into space.  She is now hyper and will not rest, even though it is 3am.  She continues to shiver and prance, holding her tail awkwardly.  Another oddity is when i pet her she jerks her legs.There were no other variables to her day. i became concerned and searched if this med has reputation for causing adversities.  YES!  Please read about the effects beforehand and your will find other reports of reactions!!! POISON!!! Everyone needs to report their reactions to the FDA, Here is link http://www.dogsadversereactions.com/fdasuspect.html</review>

<review id="5598">I bought this machine today and loved the way it looked. Unfortunately, when the brewing is complete it beeps 5 times loudly. I usually brew my coffee early in the morning before my family is awake. The sound of the beeps is so loud that it will wake everyone in the house. I called Customer Service to see if the beep could be silenced; unfortunately, it cannot. I am returning this machine tomorrow.</review>

<review id="5599">I purchased an earlier model (one with the "porsche" design), only to find that the quality of the drive enclosure was total crap. Very poorly designed, and looked cheesy as well... Might as well have been of paper mache. Dissatisfied, I returned it for a Western Digital MyBook which is still running strong two years later.With that said, LaCie may have improved their quality since then. I generally try to stay clear of French or Italian products in general unless its food :)</review>

<review id="5600">I got used to the new layout, which is actually nice. You can visually find what you are looking for. What is really annoying are the new file formats. The default document type is now a new 2007 format that only Microsoft 2007 can read. If you email this format to someone who has Office 2003, he/she cannot read it. To me this is just a marketing trick that eventually will force all users to have Office 2007. There is a 1997-2003 Word option but you have to remember to always save in this format if you want to communicate with the rest of the world.</review>

<review id="5604">I ordered the HF100, two 16GB cards, the extra-juice battery & the optional A/C quick charger.  I would order the same package again.  You will likely want the spare battery.Going mostly solid-state is really nice.  Being able to swap out SD cards & have hours of HD on such a small, versatile device is great.  I'm sold on the flash memory camcorder concept, no question.The HF100 takes great video, great audio, great pictures.  It's pretty easy to use (if you're right-handed) and was a lot smaller than I expected.There's no viewfinder, you have to use the LCD display.  This became a problem after the LCD screen died suddenly.  The screen still had power, but no image. I wanted to order a replacement, but couldn't after the 1st one broke so quickly/easily.You'll want a tripod.At least on a Mac, processing the video is pretty easy, but takes time and a ton of drive space at full resolution.The included cables are very useful, can plug into any display with component or composite inputs.I didn't use the included software, computer recognized the data without any problems.</review>

<review id="5605">Thanks for all the reviews.  I was just about to buy it and thank god I read the reviews in the last minute.  I have just switched over from PC to an iMac as my main home computer and have plans to hotsync my palm pilot to the iMac (not tried yet).  I do use the pocketquicken on my PDA which syncs with my Quicken on PC very well.  Quite likely it wont with Quicken on Mac, if it is as bad as people describe it.  Other than using Parallels and still sticking with windows version, I cant think of another alternative.</review>

<review id="5607">My wife and I run an Internet cafe, and we bought two Cuisinarts to back up our Bunn coffee maker.While the Cuisinarts look beautiful and make good coffee, it's never hot enough - not even to begin with, and a half hour later we may as well have unplugged it. Even on the hot setting, the Cuisinarts won't keep coffee hot.For that reason alone, I'd never buy another one and don't recommend them.</review>

<review id="5608">This item is useless. It isn't compatible with most the games I have and doesn't work the way a controller should work. Often, some of the buttons can't be assigned an action and since most games require duel joysticks, you can't never look around with this controller. AHHHH!!!</review>

<review id="5609">I bought this DVD and Tracy's mat workout. I LOVE her mat workout and find it one of the best I've ever done. I got her cardio workout because I love to dance and thought, "What a great way to lose weight!" Well, I never expected the to have to learn 8 very complicated and difficult routines to follow before I could even dance to it! Not to mention the fact that one really needs a lot of room to do some of her routines. I noticed in the video that she is using Gwyneth Paltrow's own personal gym (I saw it on Oprah when she shared her workout with us) and I couldn't help but think while I was attempting to learn the moves how nice it would be to have a gym like Gwyneth's to dance in! Even after I moved every piece of furniture out of my living room, I STILL didn't have enough room to do the dance without hitting the walls and door. My other biggest complaint against this video is that though Tracy's method is great, she doesn't do very well at teaching it. Even during the mat DVD, she hardly talks and doesn't cue when she's going on to another move. She barely takes the time to review each routine before she moves on to doing it at full tempo and when she does do it at full tempo, she doesn't follow the moves she just taught exactly and it throws one off! I'm pretty upset that this DVD isn't working out for me and I'll be checking out other cardio DVDs as I know I really need to get my hour in. I'm not sure who I'd recommend this DVD to... maybe someone who is REALLY great at dancing, picking up routines, and who has a personal gym like Gwyneth's!</review>

<review id="5610">I would have given this 3 or more stars for taste and mixability (is that a word? : ) ), but the ingredients are terrible. Why take a health product that has unhealthy ingredients? I won't be buying this again.It has artificial flavor. BAD!And worse, it has Acesulfame artificial sweetener. Do some Googling on it. It causes cancer in animals and is reportedly worse than aspartame and saccharin. Oh well, the search goes on.

<review id="5611">The first book was great, the second was so so, the third just sucked.  I couldn't even get through it.  Plus, it made me mad.  There wasn't any story to it.  It was just the girl vacillating between two love interests for hundreds of pages.  And the big ending?  She loves BOTH men, and she just has to divide herself into two different parts.  Gag me.  On what planet is it acceptable to be in love with two different men?</review>

<review id="5612">I really liked the player until today when it "locked up" on me.  The display is frozen and the back light is on.  It doesn't respond to any buttons and removing the battery doesn't fix the problem.  Basically, its just junk now. You might think something like this would work for more then the 20 hours I used it.  I've seen other reviews where people have reported exaclty the same problem.  Don't buy it.</review>

<review id="5613">When I first got this item, I was pretty excited- it seemed to be a reasonable price (compared to other juicers).  Within the first couple days of owning this, I accidentally broke one of the widgets that held "arms" to the machine... though it was still running.  Then one day, I am prepped with carrots and apples ready to go, then plug the thing into the wall... only to find that it doesn't come on.  Quite a disappointment!  Based on my experiences, I found that the pulp was not totally dry when it landed in the chute- kind of a waste, actually.  I am actually quite surprised that this thing gets such high marks from other Amazon buyers... I think there are better models out there- you get what you pay for!</review>

<review id="5614">I bought this drive and brought it home to give it a try the same day. I tried it with two different MacBook Pros, and a Dell PC, but the drive failed to mount in ALL THREE of them. The light turned on but there was no indication of the drive connected to the computers. You could hear it spinning and there was a strange beeping noise every few seconds. Will be returning and spending a little bit more money on a drive with better reviews.</review>

<review id="5615">There are Quality control problems with this maker. The coffee made started off medium strength (at best) and is now rapidly moving towards brown water. I have had the maker ~ 1 week. The filters don't fit the basket and the carafe has a weird slow pour spout that is irritating. Apparently they are not made in Japan. It will be returned. Pass on this.</review>

<review id="5622">we have 4 small dogs and live in south florida, we have never before had a tick problem until this summer all of a sudden they started getting ticks every single time they went outside the house.  So we bought advantix and still continued to have a major tick problem finding them attched to the dogs, still alive and all over the house as well.  we just applied a second dose only about 3 weeks later since our tick problem is still so bad (as well as having our intire house and yard professionally fumagated), hopefully this will do the trick.

<review id="5623">We burned through 2 Magic Bullets in a fairly short amount of time. Now I'm left with all the cups, blender attachment, juicer attachment, etc. After learning that most blenders work with either a standard or wide mouth mason jar depending upon brand, why not just buy a case of mason jars at your local grocer or retailer and attach that to your blender? If you want mugs Ball makes Mason Mugs, they're only $8-10 a dozen. You can even try your Mayo jar! All you do is fill the mason jar with ingredients, attach the bottom of the blender to the mason jar, and set it on your blender base and turn it on. Basically the Magic Bullet is a blade, a motor, and a small jar. You can get that in a blender for less money. The juicer function is worthless, and it doesn't come with this set anyway. I could have saved myself a ton of money if I had just purchased the mason jars. Lesson learned.</review>

<review id="5624">Hardware - Review on hardware alone.  This model is by far the best value out of the entire macbook pro line.  I hate the glossy screen, and the price for the 2.6 chip or the 17" vs the benefits of these upgrades, wasn't worth it to me.  Overall the hardware and design is solid.Software - This would be my biggest complaint.  As a Java developer I can't recommend mac os vs using linux especially polished distros like fedora, or ubuntu. Why ? well they only support java 5 32 bit and 64 bit, and only java 6 64 bit. For example most gui applications on the mac need to be paid for, when in linux most can be downloaded for free.  Now weather or not you care for the polish or the fancy graphics is a different concern.  I'm looking just overall quality and choice of software.  To make the os actually usable, you have to use several 3rd party software solutions.  Example Finder is the worse implementation of a file manager I have ever seen... thats why Path Finder is so popular. Expose is a terrible alternative to finding programs.  Just compare the actions taken looking for applications when using task bar vs expose. Skip the graphics and make it useful.  When having 15 - 20 applications open expose becomes unusable.  I think the keyboard layout of mac is terrible.  Just do a comparison on cut and paste.  When pressing command or apple button + c .. your hand is curled and awkward VS .. ctrl + c .. your hand is extended, and can reach other keys easily.  Just something as simple as that.. makes a big difference to me.  Now people say just use linux or windows .. in separate partition... well I payed the apple tax to be able to use mac os.Overall comparable hardware can be bought cheaper when deals come along, and can save about 500.  For the power of a *nix os and the polish of windows.. is good , especially if you are not a power user.  But overall for my needs, I would not make this mistake again.</review>

<review id="5625">used a linksys wireless g for a few years and found its performance acceptable. It died prematurely, but i bought another a few months ago to replace it. It has not worked out. The security with remote computers is much more difficult to set up and maintain than the previous version of the same router. They are hard to set up (you have to use lengthy codes) and the signal is intermittent.  This means the network for all your users goes out and gets you in the doghouse with the users on your network. I've had to reset the router fairly often and the connection speeds are consistently slower than the previous version of the router. I am buying another brand and will not miss this product.</review>

<review id="5626">I was hoping the Gentle Spray Collar would help encourage my dog not to bark when someone walked by my apartment in the hallway. Unfortunately, it did not help at all. I concede that when it effectively sprayed, she stopped barking immediately, but it only sprayed about 2% of the time, which makes it not only an inffective quick fix but a very inadequate long-term training tool. It's also bulky and uncomfortable looking and the battery dies quite quickly if you forget to shut the device off after removing it from your dog. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</review>

<review id="5627">This is the greatest little camera to add along with my digital camera for researching and documentation of family events. It is so small and it is alwyas in my purse to use when unexpected events take place. After I finally worked my way through the intros and instructions it is so easy. It is impossible to really put into words how much I have enjoyed using it. At 70+ years, I don't take to new gadgets right off the bat, and have to work my way through the process. It is highly recommended by me for any who love to document family and other events on a short notice.</review>

<review id="5628">She didn't need to write this book if this was what it was going to come down to. She could have just told us the terrible, fanfiction-esque plot and then I could have sat in my room, cried a little, and go on with my life as if Eclipse was the last book in the series. Or written my own, or something. Here's what is wrong with Breaking Dawn:1. Bella getting pregnant - this is non-canon, out of character rubbish. I don't care how she explained it, it's wrong.2. Jacob's imprinting - creepy, way too neat, and Bella's feelings just poof away. Felt like a desperate plot device.3. Renesmee - in her own way she was cute. But her name...really SM? Carlie would have been acceptable - this is not.4. Climax - non-existent. What climax? Omg, omg, we're gonna fight the Volturi!...Oh, never mind, we're not. False alarm!5. Bella as a vampire - great description at first. However, Edward and Bella's relationship got lost somewhere, Bella's personality did a 180 from clumsy 18-yr-old to super mature vampire super-hero, and on top of it all, the whole climactic making the ultimate decision between humanity and vampire-ness was lost. Thanks.6. Rosalie - did anybody else notice this? I really thought we'd made some progress with Rosalie in Eclipse in understanding her and having her not be a heartless b**** all the time. And then suddenly we lost it. All character development went out the window.All in all, I thought Breaking Dawn was a not bad read. But I will never count it as part of the Twilight series. In my head, it is something that just happened to occur in the Twilight universe but is in no way connected to Edward and Bella. I might just go through the book with white-out and change all the character's names. For me, the series ended at Eclipse, because I'm not sure this one was even written by Stephenie Meyer. I am still a huge Stephenie Meyer and Twilight fan but I feel...let down. This book was just pages and pages of neatly resolved problems and perfect happy endings.</review>

<review id="5629">I purchased this product for my wife, and received it yesterday.  Unfortunately, the product would not boot up, not even once.  It would shut down automatically right after the Acer splash screen.  Acer technical support is non-existent.  I emailed them through their website yesterday, and did not receive a response until today, after I had already packaged it up and shipped it back to Amazon.  Additionally, the tech support just reiterated the troubleshooting solution from the website, which was to attempt to power it on without the battery and only the adapter.  Needless to say, that didn't work the first time, and therefore, that's why I emailed them.  I did a search on the Internet and found that quite a few others were having a shutdown issue with their Aspire Ones.  If you do a search for "Acer Aspire One shut down issue," you'll find the threads.  It's a nice looking computer.  My wife's eyes lit up when she saw the pink color.  Too bad it had to disappoint her.  I have decided to look at different brands like Lenovo's S10 or Asus' Eee PC.</review>

<review id="5630">I really had a great 20 minutes. Turned off and the screen has never returned. So a 3 1/2 hour phone call to Acer.

<review id="5631">My wife has a KitchenAid UltaPower mixer that she bought 12 years ago.  It is great, but she wanted more power & speed so we ordered this one.  15 minutes out of the carton and we packed it back up.  This mixer is much larger and more powerful but feels lighter that the Ultrapower model and even unstable.  The standard attachements are much lower quality.  They feel like attachments for a toy mixer.  Also, just the overall look and feel of the mixer feels like it was cheaply made. For example, raising and lowering the bowl is isn't smooth.  It doesn't move over the rail like it should. The bowl itself also looked very poorly made and even had some small dents.  This is still probably a good mixer, but it is not the symbol of quality these mixers were.  We will stick with the old ultrapower.</review>

<review id="5632">I purchased this unit with the hopes of being able to take my blood pressure on a daily basis. My health warrants that I monitor it closely. I tried taking my pressure at least 15 times before I got a reading. I kept getting error messages or no reading at all. The unit would show the number 7 and then the 60 seconds would show up and count backwards until it reached zero then the cuff would inflate again only to come back to no reading. I sent the unit back to amazon the next day. This unit is a piece of junk and it will cause your blood pressure to go up due to aggravation. I went to CVS and purchased their brand name unit for $25.00 less and it works perfect. Don't waste your time or money on this unit.</review>

<review id="5635">This review is from: The Tale of Despereaux [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)      I cannot believe the fabulous reviews this trainwreck received! What a nightmare! Spoiler alert! There are multiple "main" characters all of whom are experiencing existential dilemmas or, in the case of the maid, a psychotic break. Note to parents of young kids, this psychotic break means that she decides that SHE is the princess and then (on the advice of a once kind, now malevolent, rat who she thinks is just a voice in her head giving her directions) kidnaps the princess to be eaten by feral rats in a gladiator style ring. I swear I am not making this up. The titular main character, Despereaux, although cute is kind of an afterthought in the psych ward of the rest of the story. He is banished and condemned to death (this is a kids movie?!?!) by the mouse council of elders because he is not afraid enough. His parents buckle to societal pressure and kick him to the curb. He is then tossed to the gladiator pit as bait for a rabid cat for the entertainment of the mob of rats. I kept waiting for any of this to make sense and it just didn't happen. I am baffled by reviews that call this great family entertainment. There are much better options than this. SKIP IT!!!</review>

<review id="5636">This item is great at pulling out loose hair, but it also pulls at other hairs from the root.  I have to say that I have 6 cats and they did not like it.  It causes them pain so I will not use the item again.</review>

<review id="5637">I bought this device to play audible format ([...]) books.  It says right on the box that it supports that format..even comes with a startup membership to audible.  WRONG.. I went to audible to activate the device and they told me that SANDISK FALSELY advertised that it supported audible.  They have been waiting the flash codes and sandisk still has not sent them.  I tried contacting SANDISK to complain and get direction but there was no response to my concerns.  I would NOT buy this device again and I am questioning if I should purchase other sandisk products, if this is par for the course for their customer service.</review>

<review id="5638">It may be OK in a warm wather climate but it did not work here. The wires running to the 9 volt battery broke off and I had to resolder them.

<review id="5639">I just can't seem to get used to this pad.The idea seemed perfect on paper, but once I try it, it feels too bulky, complicated and slow.The movement keys are too big! It feels almost like a child's toy keyboard.I wonder why did they make those keys so unconfortably bulky...?On the other hand, some of the top keys (save, load key etc.) are too small, and quite close togheter, so it can get confusing during heated gameplay, leading to accidental Saves instead of loads, or vice-versa.The lower keys (jump, crouch etc.) feel too low, which make me feel like I need two extra tumbs attached to my wrist in order to use them correctly.The side buttons are totally useless for me, since you have to take your hand off the movement keys to access them.All in all, if you have Giant Sasquatch hands, or abnormally long spider-fingers, buy this pad Now! If you have everyday normal sized hands like most of us, don't get mixed up with this pad. It tries to do something really good and usefull, but it fails miserably in confort and design.</review>

<review id="5640">As a Mac user since 1989, I have used Word since version 1. After 5.1a, it was all downhill, and I don't think they can go any lower than this package. If I did not have to have it because of work I do with Europeans who have their own set of issues with software, I would save the money and stick to iWork. How can Excel lock up and shut down every 5 minutes? On normal task functions, not even processing or entering formulae? I don't know but it does. Word is cumbersome and no improvement at all over Office X. It's VERY slow to start up, and as often as it spontaneously shuts down, that eats up a lot of my rather valuable work time.A true disappointment from Microsoft. I SO wish older versions could run on Leopard!</review>

<review id="5641">My experience was with the first version of this router (which was released in March 2003), so some of my concerns may not apply to the latest versions.Routing performance: C (Might not apply to later versions)This router is somewhat of a bottleneck. It felt a tiny bit slower than my first Internet router, a Linksys BEFSR41 v1.0 (which is really old compared to today's technology), but was noticeable only when I really thought about it. However, its performance and the performance of the Linksys BEFSR41 v1.0 is somewhat noticeably slower compared to a Linksys WRT54GL. This performance may have been hampered by the probable fact that my cable modem might only support 100Base-T4 and not 100Base-TX, while the WGR614 probably supports 100Base-TX and not 100Base-T4. 100Base-T4 uses all eight wires in an Ethernet link, slowing the signal symbol rate down in order to make the signal reliable enough for Category 3 (voice phone grade) cable. Unfortunately, it forces half-duplex communication. 100Base-TX uses only four of the eight wires in an Ethernet connection, requiring Category 5 (data grade) cable for reliable transmission and reception. The upside is that full-duplex communication is enabled, potentially doubling total throughput and eliminating time-wasting collisions if only switches are used. Therefore, the cable modem and WGR614 tried to initiate Fast Ethernet communication, but kept failing until I had to handicap the WAN port to force it to use 10Base-T in the Web-based configuration utility, forcing my cable modem and the router to talk to each other in a low-speed mode with no choices of variants to cause problems with.Ethernet switching performance: F (Might not apply to later versions)When two devices are trying to communicate with each other on the Ethernet LAN, I found out that this device is a serious bottleneck. Backups from one computer to another took long amounts of time compared to the time they took when either a Linksys BEFSR41 version 1.0 or a Netopia 3347W 802.11b wireless ADSL router with four-port switch was used as the switch in between the source and destination computers.Security: C (Applies to all versions)This router is capable of WPA-PSK using TKIP encryption. This is OK for today, but is not as secure as WPA-PSK or WPA2-PSK using AES encryption. WPA is basically a stopgap standard for the time when 802.11i was unfinished in order to provide some real security until the time 802.11i was finished. 802.11i was finally finished and has gotten the marketing name WPA2. TKIP is basically WEP with a patch that masks away all attacks known to WEP. This mask is considered a masterpiece of retro-engineering because it brings real security to legacy devices. The problem with TKIP is that it is not as strong as AES encryption, and the worry that there are attacks left to discover in WEP that were not known when TKIP was discovered and therefore punch through both WEP and TKIP. Competitors like Linksys's WRT54GL have WPA, WPA-PSK, WPA2, and WPA2-PSK with both TKIP and AES encryption, making WPA-only devices obsolete. What is infuriating is that in all of the major Wi-Fi chip makers' 802.11g products integrated AES hardware designed to add 802.11i compliance when the standard was finished. Many manufacturers have failed to do the right thing and use this hardware to implement WPA2 or WPA2-PSK on their 802.11g products.Reliability: F (Likely applies to later versions, as their cases look like they are not well-ventilated, like this version. However, there is a small but significant chance that I could be wrong.)This thing has a habit of crashing due to overheating. When you look at the packaging, it looks aesthetically pleasing, but its design makes it overheat. You are practically forced to stand it up to try to make it easier for it to dissipate heat due to convection currents. Fortunately, this is easy to do, but it will still occasionally crash and gets really hot to the touch even when it is stood upright on its side so that it can take advantage of convection currents to dissipate heat. Netgear redesigned its packaging for versions 5 through 7 of the hardware. This redesign looks like it will help the router dissipate heat better when it is stood upright on its side, but will make it overheat faster when it is placed flat on a surface. I would rather have an ugly but functional router than a beautiful but malfunctioning router. If I wanted a piece of art, I would go to the mall and buy a small statue or painting instead of a beautiful but malfunctioning router. Linksys's router designs, like its BEFSR41 and WRT54GL, prove that something can look good and work well.Wi-fi performance: C (Might not apply to later versions)It has great range. However, it is difficult for other Wi-fi cards to connect to it in WPA mode. However, once a connection is established, it never drops the connection unless it crashes or loses power. It has no problems synchronizing in WEP or no encryption modes. I have had no trouble connecting to a Netopia ADSL router nor a Linksys WRT54GL router with my wireless card in WPA-PSK mode, so WPA-PSK support on this router must be buggy.ConclusionNetgear might have fixed the instability, performance, and overheating performance in later hardware revisions. However, even the current version's lack of WPA2 support renders this product obsolete. Get a router that can support WPA2 and looks like it has enough ventilation to keep itself cool enough to prevent crashing.</review>

<review id="5644">I bought the B60 a year ago and absolutely love the convenience and variety of K-cups.  Up until very recently I would have wholeheartedly recommended any of the Keurig K-cup brewers.But...  I've just been informed that Keurig will cut their K-cup internet retailer significantly (including Amazon as far as I can tell) in 2007.  So the great prices, selection and service one gets from a variety of e-tailers will be no more.  So if one wants any coffees beyond just the basic selection at the local Target, one has to pay the exorbitant ~$0.56/K-cup.  It's simply too much... particularly when one has a choice in single serve coffee (pods, Tassimo).</review>

<review id="5649">I devoured the first three books of the series.  Each in a day in a half.  The whole series is an escapist fantasy and I understand that it must be treated as such, with heavy self-administrations of suspended disbelief along the entire way.Meyer doesn't disappoint in delivering the escapist fantasy, nor does she disappoint in delivering a fast-moving, action-packed storyline.  What she DOES disappoint in is delivering a meaningful story that will resound with the reader - one that can touch us and inspire us and leave us as better people in the end.**SPOILERS**From the beginning of the series, Bella is made out to be the underdog and everybody roots for the underdog.  Everybody to some extent identifies with the underdog.  But the best underdogs are the ones that claw their way out of the gutter and FIGHT, tooth and nail, to the top to where they can finally revel in the reward that they have achieved.  This struggle is essential.  It is echoed in every great story that has ever touched anyone's heart - the great comic heroes, the Disney movie protagonists, etc.  Bella lacks this struggle.  Sure, there are obstacles along the way, but there is no real struggle.  There is anticipation, worry, fear, sure.  But the most Bella has to ever do is close her eyes and poke her fingers in her ears and sing LALALA, blocking out reality, until fate decides to take it easy on her and fix everything before she opens her eyes.  Her most admirable trait is her sheer stubbornness.  Meyer likes to think that she created a martyr in Bella.  She thinks that because Bella stayed quiet during her transformation so that she wouldn't hurt Edward and Carlisle, or that she told Jacob to run away with Renesmee while she stayed to fight, that she is a real hero.  But she is NOT a hero, she is just steadfastly selfish.  She sees Edward, and wants Edward, and will do anything to be happy with Edward - even if it requires breaking her best friend's heart, or her parents' hearts, or anything else.  Later on Renesmee is incorporated into this, too.  But her tunnel-vision prevents her from growing and becoming the heroine that everyone who is watching her (us, as the readers) desperately wants her to be.Romeo and Juliet would not have been the timeless classic that it is today if the story had been effortless- if the warring families had put down their arms for the sake of their beloved son and daughter and had the miraculous happy ending that Breaking Dawn has.Superman would not be an iconic superhero if he had no obstacles to make him stumble - if his well-being and the serious well-being of those he deeply cared the most about were not truly threatened.As it were, no one that Bella loves is ever in danger.  Nothing seriously threatens to take away what she cares about.  We never truly fear for Renesmee because we know that the book will not end on the Volturi killing her.  We do not fear for Bella's health when she is pregnant with Renesmee because we know that there is no way for her to fall - vampirization will save her no matter what.  We know that she will not lose Jacob, because he imprints (how conveniently, at that.  Out of nowhere.  What a contrivance) on Renesmee.  We know her parents are never in danger, and what's more, they are never even really estranged from Bella so she never has to worry about that potential loss.  Despite what authors of 5 and 4 star ratings might think, I am not ranting against the "happy ending" or being bitter and disillusioned.  I love the fact that Bella was able to be happy in the end.  But the real pain is that I held Bella too high in my expectations.  I believed that she could earn happiness - that she had the potential to FLY, not just wait for everything to fall in her lap while she grumbled about life.  In The Shawshank Redemption, Andy finally escapes and it is a happy ending.  It is a REAL happy ending because he used his intelligence and strength of will to work at something better than the hand life dealt him.  And when he escapes, our souls exult for him.  If, like Bella, Andy had achieved a happy ending by moping in his cell until someone offered to grant him super powers and he then just busted a hole in the wall and walked out, it might still be a happy ending, but to a much lesser degree.Yes, Breaking Dawn is sort of like a dream or fairy tale.  It does not have to listen to the strict laws of reality.  But in order to be the best story that it can be, it DOES need to be something we can relate to, even if remotely.  Meyer had a great premise with the Twilight Saga.  She created a cast of characters that I (for the most part) adored, and so of course I wanted to see the story fulfill its potential.The biggest disappointment is that no one did- in a bizarre case of deus ex machina, Meyer swoops into the story time and time again with contrivance after contrivance.  So I did not hate the book but as things stand, but honest-to-God, it broke my heart to see it fall so short.</review>

<review id="5651">As others have said, this version has ruined the online banking feature.  Not only is the Add Multiple Transations missing, the smart dropdown menus are missing, you can't see the register, you can't match a transaction with the correct one if it guesses wrong and online banking needs to close all the windows, but Automatically recall last transaction and Quick Add doesn't work either.You can't add new vendors and if the vendor isn't in your list, you get a transaction added without the name of the vendor, so I have to go through the register comparing to my online banking to fill in missing vendor names of which I use quite a bit each year.Recurring charges have to be entered anew each time even though my settings tell QB to autofill the last transaction.I should have rolled back immediately upon having trouble, but I trusted the Beta engineers saying that fixes were in the works.  Now that the live version has been out and it is no better, I will have to roll back to 2006 even if that means re-entering these months of data for the time it will save me daily.I love QB and have been using it since 6.0 (the version right before QB99).  I still think it's great in all other ways and I do like the new snapshot feature, although it could also use a few tweaks.I simply can't afford the loss of time the online banking issue costs me daily.  If you have few or no online transactions, there's no problem with using QB2009 that I've seen, but if you have more than 10 transactions a week, your hair pulling will outweigh any benefit of upgrading to 2009.I will keep the 2009 on my one business that only uses about 10 online transactions a month and keep an eye on that feature improving, but I keep hearing it will and my time is important to me, so I can't wait for something indefinate.Intuit would be better off chucking the whole new online banking segment and rolling back to the old version of Online Banking.  QB 2006 (and 07 and 08) online banking was AWESOME and it made my life easy and I will be returning to it this week.</review>

<review id="5652">What a letdown.  What a mess.  What a shame.  I'm sorry, but when an action movie's set pieces are edited together in 1-3 second bursts before switching angles, you're in for anything but excitement.  Right off the bat, there's a "car" chase (CGI enhanced car chase) that will have you saying, "who's who?" and "where are they?" and "now where are they?" in relation to the other vehicles and roads/tunnels involved.  Come on, gimme some real cars in wideshots with some friggin' establishing shots, for Pete's sake.  Throughout the entire movie, the action's edited this way.  Are stupid kids today so text happy trigger fast that movie makers are catering to their lack of attention spans?  Just like texts, these action scenes are fast and full of nothing.  And the story...  What the heck was it?  A guy trying to control a region's water supply from a base conveniently located in a desert so it's easier to film without extras mucking up the scenery?  Yawn.  I hate to be harsh on anything Bond, but this one ranks way down on the list.  To be fair, there were some good things in this film, as it's hard to completely destroy a character and series that has such a solid foundation, so here they are: pretty locales, pretty lead actress, pretty opera scene, and good hand to hand combat.  The bad: muddled story, homages/rip-offs of other Bond films (Goldfinger girl becoes Oilfinger girl, rogue Bond done better in License To Kill), tongue-in-cheek violence and predictable action pieces, and horrible 1-3 seconds per frame editing.  Bond has not lasted almost 50 years by being a ripped ab thug who just runs around beating people up.  He's cool, calculating, and classy.  Gimme a Bond that has to sweat it out a little before coming up with an ingenius escape.  Bond films are famous for their unforgettable action/escape set-pieces (the slow burning laser to the groin, the fight in the train compartment, the ski jump off a cliff, being pulled underwater into coral while bleeding in shark infested waters, etc.)  This film had one, a short hand-to-hand fight that could've been in a martial arts movie instead of a Bond film.  Bond films are famous for their witty dialogue ("No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die", "Speak now or forever hold your ...", "He disagreed with something that ate him", "The b*tch is dead", etc.).  I can't remember any in this one.  Bond films are even known for their pathos (Connery reacting to Shirley Eaton's dead body painted in gold, Lazenby reacting to Diana Rigg's car crash death, Moore learning that he had killed Barbara Bach's lover, Dalton discovering Priscilla Barnes' ravaged body still in her wedding gown, Brosnan holding Sophie Marceau after shooting her in cold blood, Craig consoling Vesper during her breakdown in the shower, etc.)  None of that anymore.  This Bond dumps a body in a dumpster which is as close as we get, unless you think his offhanded words to M about a gratuitous Bond girl having basically been a good worker after she's killed deep stuff.  Even M seems to be tired of this Bond.  Who can blame her?  He just goes around killing people out of vengeance from an earlier film and/or just because they get in his way.  This was directed by a Bourne director and it shows.  It's all just fast paced, super-hero style stuff, but Bourne at least had a real motive for finding the people he's after; he had lost his memory which gave things a real twist as you found out who he was along with him.  We know who Bond is.  So does he.  Bring back the clever, suave Bond.  Bring back the human Bond who gets beat up at times but is so determined to survive that he thinks his way out of situations.  Bring back real chases and stunts to be sipped and savored.  Real stunts have perhaps become Bond's biggest trademark and cannot be replaced with quick editing and CGI (that awful Die Another Day avalanche surf scene should've been the end of that nonsense, but it's back with dangling rope bells on).  This Bond was shaken and stirred so much that most of the martini wound up all over the floor.  Better luck next time, 007.</review>

<review id="5653">I tried for a few hours to get the D-Link software to work properly with their hardware, but could not get anything going that was stable for more than 30 minutes. The driver has many issues with Skype, including crashing, leaving stray D-Link processes in memory, locking up, losing contact with Skype, etc.The driver will randomly crash, sometimes if you just pick up the attached phone and set it back down a few times. It doesn't take much. Also, the attached phone does not ring. I tried with two phones and even the most basic phone will not ring when a Skype call comes in.As for the forwarding feature, it is manual. There is no quick setting or time-based setting for auto-forwarding to say, a cell phone.Also, there are problems with D-Link's USB implementation in that it draws an illegal amount of power from the USB bus. Their little box really should have a power brick as my Adaptec USB card tells me it is drawing more than 500mA (and the Adaptec does not allow it). So I had to run it on a machine with really old USB ports that do not protect against power overdraw. Bad, bad, bad.The entire package feels like it was rushed to market without any real testing. I would wait for a few revisions on this one. Maybe in 6-12 months it will work better. That's how it goes for a lot of D-Link products. For example, it took until the 1.6 BIOS for my D-Link gaming router to be "solid". That was about 6 months. So unless you want to be an unpaid D-Link beta tester, I would pass on this thing for now. The idea is good, the implementation is not.</review>

<review id="5662">I don't like to return things, and I don't like to write negative reviews. Well, doing both..I thought it would be a good idea to leave my 4.5 years old IBM T42 at home and trave with smaller, lighter and brand new Aspire One. Wrong. The touchpad of Aspire One stopped working just a few days after I purchased it. I swear I didn't drop the netbook or abuse it in any form. The touchpad just stopped working. Fortunately I brought an external mouse. If you happend to see an idiot at the airport using mouse on the surface of airport seat during the past holiday season, that could be me. My 4.5 year old IBM never has such a problem. Touchpad failure beats the purpose of netbook. Two other minor issues. If you leave the netbook idle for a long time, or close the cover, it goes to sleep mode, which is good. However, it is not intuitive to me how to wake it up later. My T42 will wake up by just a touch on any key or mouse. I cleaned the surface with a tissue -- not the softest kind, but it is a paper tissue. Guess what? A piece of the beauitiful blue paint was sactched out. It is a little piece, but obvious enough for anyone to notice. I don't know if Amazon will put 15% penalty for this return. If it does, this is equivlent to a two dollar per day rental of a netbook without touchpad. not a good buy.</review>

<review id="5663">This is my 3rd Linksys router and I definitely feel that it is not what it used to be.This router has very nice features, like the external usb support, FTP server, DynDNS support and of curse the dual band.Well, the connection to the 5GHz network is quite fragile, disconnects quite a lot and also has low signal (and I live in a small 1br apt). So most of the time I work on the old 2.4Ghz network.Other than that, the FTP server is a cool feature, easy way for sharing files with family and friends, but guess what, it does not support resume, so my friend uploaded a big file, got disconnected after 10 hours, and couldn't resume the upload, what were they thinking ?!!Sometimes the router "loose" the connection to the modem, you can push hundred times on the "renew ip address" on console management program, but nothing. Only endless restarts may cause it to take ip once again.now my router management console does not respond, just changed something in the FTP configuration and the software is not responding, go figure...Bottom, DON'T buy unless you must have N router with external usb support.</review>

<review id="5666">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      First, the good: the special effects are excellent. The robots move fluidly and their transformations are not awkward. The female lead for the movie is smoking hot. Now, the bad: everything else. The dialogue is unbearable, littered with witless one-liners and forced humor. This is nicely complimented by cringe-inducing acting. It seems like the characters were reading their lines for the first time in the movie; I don't expect anything special for an action movie, but the acting was bad enough to keep me distracted from the movie itself. Too many plot holes. I won't get into specifics out of respect to people who still haven't seen the movie. The action looks silly...kind of like the Matrix-style overly-choreographed dance scenes where an accidental fist or bullet gets thrown in here and there. So...no story, no acting and poor action; why do you want to still see this movie? That extra star gets thrown in for the female lead. She IS a serious bomber.Finally, if you are a Transformers fan, don't watch this movie. Instead of being a fun update, it's closer to having a fat Hollywood exec probing your mind to get into your childhood memories and then promptly loosening his bowels on them. I was curious, and for that, I was punished. I won't get into why (this would take a few month's work), just trust me. Don't forget that this is a Bruckheimer piece if you doubt my warning.</review>

<review id="5672">I called Intuit to determine what steps had been taken to rectify the problems many users were having with online banking etc. I spoke to "Joyce". I asked her if they knew of any reviews saying, "Thanks for fixing the online integration problems!" or any statements from Intuit acknowledging problems and detailing fixes. It took her a good five minutes to understand my question. Then five minutes on hold. Then she again told me to visit their web site to look for an answer. And she reminded me that I get 24/7 support with QB. Great. They'll waste my time *after* I pay them too. Wonderful. Earlier in the day I did some chat support with "Eric". He wasted 15 minutes of my time asking me if I needed certain features. After answering "no" to over 90% of his questions, he recommends I purchase their Premiere edition, as it has all of the features we'd discussed. (My initial question was, "Why should I get Pro over the basic version?") He never answered my question. So here I am, about 45 minutes wasted talking and typing to Intuit, and I'm sold on their support sucking harder than a Hoover with a gland problem... but I have no answers. I'm not aware if Peachtree, Microsoft or other solutions are better, but I'm going to use a QB alternative solely on principle. If you think you'll EVER need support or a clear answer, Quickbooks isn't for you.</review>

<review id="5679">I bought this bc I have a Chow Chow with very thick fur.  I normally use a rake tool but thought I would give this a try. I got the medium, and when i tried it, the fur came out but it came out in small pieces and didnt stick to the tool like it did on the rake. The fur just blew all around the house like tumbleweeds, as opposed to sticking on the rake until it filled up. The same process was being achieved, but I felt like it would take 5x as long with the Furminator. Chows shed that undercoat in little chunks, not like a Lab would shed. This part I didnt like bc my dog has so much hair and I have to rake her undercoat so deep, the furminator didnt get as deep as my rake did, the teeth were not as long. I beleive this tool would work great on a shorter haired dog that didnt have as dense and thick of an undercoat as a Chow does, but I did end up returning it. The rake I feel is the best for my favorite breed of dog. I hope this helps.</review>

<review id="5682">I bought this oven and used it as a toaster several times a week for the first couple of months.  The results were not the best, but once I got the timing and placement of the slices of bread down, the product did the job.  It wasn't as good as a dedicated toaster, but I expected that.One of the big reasons I bought this was to use the oven feature so I wouldn't have to heat up my full size gas oven when cooking for myself.  I finally had the need for this about 3 months after I purchased it.  By that time, I had lost the instructions, but didn't expect there would be a problem.  I was wrong.  After a lot of trial and error, I realized that the heat sensor in the product was broken.  When trying to heat the oven, it would start fine, but would shut off around 200 degrees, regardless of the temperature setting.  Unfortunately, I didn't find this out until after Amazon's 30 day return period, so my only option is to try to find my paperwork and go to the manufacture for repair under the warranty.  I know myself well enough to realize that won't happen, so I'm stuck with buying another unit instead.</review>

<review id="5683">OK, first of all, I thoroughly love the show itself, but I'm reviewing the packaging of this season. FOUR episodes with audio commentary???????  Four out of an already short 14 episode???????I WILL NOT preorder the next seasons, if I wanted the episodes themselves, I'd go to the ABC online episode viewer.  I was paying for the extra stuff.  Previous seasons had a lot more audio commentary and that's what I was expecting.  Silly me.</review>

<review id="5684">This IS better than a regular tape measure for tracking lost/gained inches on your body. BUT- it's a flawed design. It has a plastic pin at the end of the tape that you slide into a hole on the plastic holder, which would be MUCH better if the pin actually STAYED IN PLACE! Every time you tighten it, the pin pops right out. It's as if you need a third hand to hold the pin in the hole, and boy does it get frustrating. I'm surprised no one else has mentioned it! I'm looking forward to an improved design, because yes this is better, but not by much!</review>

<review id="5685">I bought my daughter a Chi flat iron for Christmas last year. It broke within 3 months and I returned it as instructed with a $15.00 check to cover postage. My check was never cashed but our flat iron was never returned. I'm out the cost of the iron with no iron to show for it. Quite a sneaky way to do business. Get the cost of the product up front then if it breaks just have it sent back and forget it! I did not purchase this product from Amazon but I wish I had. I might have a working flat iron in my posession. I spoke with another person just today who had the same problem with a Chi and she finally got her Chi back after 1 1/2 years but it was still not fixed!!</review>

<review id="5689">Do yourself a favor and read all the negative reviews on OOMA before you decide to purchase one.  I purchased OOMA from AMAZON only to return it after a week of frustration.  Kudos to Amazon, I couldn't be happier with the ease of their return policy.  OOMA on the other hand is a joke.  I was naive and believed that the positive reviews were from actual users, now I am pretty sure they are deceptive advertising put out by OOMA. After setting up the OOMA system, I could never get a call to last over 7 seconds.  And during that 7 seconds there was a terrible voice delay.  The OOMA customer service rep that I contacted informed me that this was due to my firewall.  HELLO... It is 2009. Doesn't everyone have a firewall?  Shouldn't this have been addressed in the installation procedures?  Anyways do yourself a favor and forget about OOMA.</review>

<review id="5692">I received one of these cameras as a holiday gift.  It is easy to use, fun, and super-portable.  I also think the video quality is excellent for such a small camera and it even works well in low-lighting situations.  But what most reviewers don't mention is that the battery life is incredibly short!  You will be luck to use up all of the camera's memory before the batteries die.  This is a very cool camera, but the battery life is pretty disappointing.</review>

If I plug in any of the accessories without their own power sources (like the ipod or keyboard) I get a low USB power notice and cannot communicate with the attatched accessory. Even though this hub has its own power supply, it only alots a certain amount of power to each port, thereby decreasing the amount of power each accessory can use.

<review id="5701">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)      I'm sorry, but when I saw this movie in theater, I fell asleep through most of the scene. It was slow-paced and boring. The script was bad and the editing was horrendous. Everyone is liking this movie because of Heath Ledger. It's true that without him the movie would be even more boring. He was the only interesting one in the movie, but we can't base the whole movie on Ledger. Look at the script, cinematography and the storyline. I thought there would be more action, but everything was just all over the place. I'm a movie fanatic but yeah, I'm the minority in this review and this is my honest opinion.</review>

<review id="5703">I purchased this camera because of a review in the Wall Street Journal. It is simple to operate and takes decent video. The main issue I have had is it is fragile.

<review id="5707">I have used Lacie drives in the past with good success. So when I saw this and the great price, I ordered it. It arrived and while attempting to setup and format with the installed software, it failed and said to use the OS. The software included was also gone as the setup process removes it and is supposed to copy it back after formatting. But since it failed, nada! Bad planning on their part.The first 2 tries at formatting in XP failed, the third time succeeded. However, when attempting to copy a number of archived backup files to it, I received the XP "Delayed Write failed" error message. My computer also failed to boot with this drive turned on, I had to turn it off and back on after bootup. I tried to contact Lacie and entered an on-line support request. In the meantime I researched the error and tried all suggestions, to no avail. Luckily I bought this from Amazon and I am returning it for refund. I'll try a different brand. Never heard back from Lacie support, other than the first acknowledgement e-mail. It has been 3 business days since I entered the request. That is not acceptable, can't wait.</review>

<review id="5708">For Christmas a couple of years ago, upon my veterinarian's recommendation, I bought my cats one of these fountains.  I chose this model because of the "faucet-like" design. I brought it home and set it up, and it immediately started making a horrile sound. My cats scattered - they wouldn't come near it. I thought it was air in the pump, so I gave it a few minutes to let the air out. The sound never stopped. Figuring it was defective, I took it back to the store and got a replacement. The replacement did the the SAME thing. I took the replacement back, and got the Petmate fountain. It's very quiet, and my cats and I love it. we've not had a moment's trouble from it.</review>

<review id="5709">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      ...if you're an aspiring writer in need of a primer that gives never-ending examples of what NOT TO DO.I'm working on a teen fantasy novel of my own, and Meyers' Twilight series never fails to remind me of the things I want to completely avoid in my own writing.  Let's consult the list, shall we?1) THE BORING SUE HERIONE.  You may have heard of the Mary Sue, the perfect female protagonist who can do no wrong, who has unnatural beauty, who is beloved by all; Bella isn't quite a Mary Sue.  She's described (by herself, at least) as plain and is endlessly clumsy (though her clumsiness is so contrived that it seems like a magical Sue ability, practically).  She also has no interests, hobbies, or anything that she excels at in particular.  Despite these flaws, Bella nevertheless ends up a Sue because everyone loves her for reasons that defy explanation or logic.  Even when she is behaving in a selfish, whiny, and intolerable way, Bella is never called out for her behavior.  The only character who ever seems disgusted by Bella is Jessica, but since Jessica is written as a shrew anyway, we're clearly not meant to put much stock in her opinion. 2) FATED TRUE LOVE.  In my world, Fated True Love isn't romantic, it's lazy.  It says "hey, instead of working out why these characters are attracted to each other and showing how their relationship develops, I'm gonna just put it in the hands of FATE and have them fall in love for no reason whatsoever!"  Edward loves Bella because she smells good, which means Edward loves Bella like I love freshly baked bread.  Bella loves Edward because he's beautiful.  God-like.  So beautiful...really BEAUTIFUL, in case you missed it in all the numerous descriptive reminders.  But really, why do they love each other?  I have no idea.  Shakespeare was all too aware of the ridiculousness of star-crossed love, which is why he was smart and killed his teenaged lovers off.  But Bella and Edward's happiness hinges entirely on their togetherness.  What a strong, solid message to send to the young women of the world: happiness isn't something you create for yourself, oh no, it's something you can ONLY find in a beautiful, immortal man.  Bella's slow recognition of Jacob as a potential suitor was far more interesting and realistic, and it was teeth-gnashingly disappointing to see Bella repeatedly insist to herself that no one would ever do it for her again but Edward.3) THE ZERO-HOUR PLOT.  Nothing much happens in Meyers' books, aside from Bella's enthrallment/suffering over Edward.  In the last few chapters, Meyers will attempt to inject some kind of conflict into the narrative, either in the form of James, Victoria, and Laurent ("Twilight") or the Volturi ("New Moon").  It's difficult to get invested in this conflict at the last minute, and again feels like a lazy, tacked-on, "oh right, I am writing a book, maybe something should happen!" move from the author. Of course, as someone who hopes to be successful at writing teen fantasy, it's depressing to know that all I would need to do to achieve this success is construct a BORING SUE HEROINE, a FATED TRUE LOVE, and a ZERO HOUR PLOT.  Or maybe it's not depressing...maybe it's an incredible relief!  After all, coming up with those three things shouldn't be too hard.  If a lazy writer like Meyers can do it, anyone can! For readers looking for good, solid teen-level fantasy featuring interesting heroines, more complex and realistic portrayals of love, and truly gripping plot, I recommend Diana Wynne Jones and Libba Bray.</review>

<review id="5710">Office 2007 has lots of new and nice features, however, be aware that powerpoint cannot deal with multiple pictures and graphs on a single page without slowing to a crawl.

<review id="5711">After watching the pilot, I said, "no more" and decided not to watch anymore. Yeah, yeah, you can say "watch the rest and THEN make your verdict," but I already know what this show is just from watching the first episode. I love vampire shows, Buffy, Angel, True Blood, but those shows have constant flashes of creativity and originality with actual "bite" to it, and the pilot episode of Moonlight never managed to meet that kind of criteria. I liked the opening part because the set of the freezer was cool and I thought it would be great and cool just like the first minute, but then it ended up being bland (if a bit stylistic) and with average writing and average acting. Other vampire shows have had longer runs and are so much richer, complex and sexy at the same time, why waste money and time to watch this show that only lasted a few months on TV? I mean, I know people love this show, and I respect that, totally, but I just don't really understand why. There's nothing really new here, all of the characters really do seem soulless--you certainly can't relate to any of them, unlike Buffy where the characters went to high school and college and life just like we all do and actually have distinguishable personalities. I know the show has all the right intentions of trying to be cool and sexy and dark, but Angel already accomplished that with more complexity and apparent love put into it. This show just feels cold and almost phony, trying to live off of used material. I guess it's a decent way to fill the gap between other vampire shows, but I definitely don't think it stands well as an original, engrossing piece of TV entertainment. I give the pilot a 5/10. And the rest of the show is of no interest to me. Sorry if any fans are upset by this, if you read it even, but it's just what I think, try and understand that.</review>

<review id="5712">Maybe I'm just an old grouch, but I still prefer CDs and vinyl.  An Ipod with over 120 GB of space is like eating birthday cake at every meal.  I still enjoy packing my CDs when I travel.  The main reason I don't like the Ipod is the shuffle feature.  When I listen to my music on shuffle, it just shows me the limitations in my music collection.  The Ipod for me gets its 2 stars on simplicity alone.  It's very easy to use, but I will never buy one.</review>

<review id="5714">I have been a long-time, happy LaCie Big Disk user, but this shakes the faith.  I too had to return one of these because of a loose screw inside of the casing.  I read the reviews beforehand but did not dig enough.  I simply assumed that something this outrageous had to have been fixed.  I did not realize that the "loose screw" issue has lasted at least from the end of November to the end of February! I got my money back, but... For the time I spent repacking and sending the drive, and the inconvenience of not having the storage I needed, all I got in return was: 1) Attitude from customer service as J&R, which claimed that there was no way they could have known about the problem, because a) the problem could have occurred during shipping, and b) in any case, they didn't pack the item themselves into the factory box (when I pointed out I could still hear the screw rattling through both the factory box and the J&R box, I got no comment), and 2) plenty of advice from LaCie to not plug the thing in, but no acknowledgement that this was a common problem and no offer to fast-swap it for something else.  He did suggest that dealing with the J&R might be faster; this ended up taking over 5 days (not counting shipping) to get my money back.What a pity that a known problem couldn't be addressed at either the manufacturer or dealer level.LaCie 301201U Big Disk Extreme+ 2TB  Firewire800/Firewire400/USB 2.0 with RAID External Hard Drive</review>

<review id="5717">I've always used linksys routers.  This is the first time I've had such an awful experience.  I was happy at first.  It was easy to set up.  The wireless worked much better than my old wireless.  But then we started having intermittent connection issues, both with wired and wireless connections.  At first I thought it was the cable, but the connection worked perfectly when directly plugged in, and I also called the cable company to check on their end.  Then I worked with Linksys on the phone over five hours, with numerous operators walking me through the exact same restart instructions, till the last one finally said the router was defective.  I returned the router for another one, and again, it set up very well initially, but then started having connection issues after a few weeks. Frustrated, we've gone back to the old router (great wired, but not great range wireless), and have not had any connection issues wired, nor wired when in range of the router.  I'm going to find another router that hopefully can give us long range wireless without losing stability.  No more cisco/linksys for me.</review>

<review id="5719">The first book was okay and if I didn't buy all three books at one time I wouldn't have continued, but since I had them I read them. I was hooked in the second book and looking forward to starting the third. When I was finished I was disappointed.  I never really found Edward's character interesting and Bella's character becomes annoying and weak.  Jacob is the greatest character of them all, because he 3-dimentsional and brought a lot of action to the series.  When Edward and Bella are together all they seem to do is tell each other how wonderful each other is and how they cannot live without each other.   Also, the idea the Edward is around 80 years older than Bella just rubs me the wrong way.</review>

<review id="5720">this seller is among the most unprofessional that i have ever dealt with on amazon. they contacted me to remove negative feedback on their shipping and customer service, offered me a deal for free shipping and a %age off my next order.

I will NEVER order from them again and suggest that anyone else who runs across them shops around. Just say no to herballoveshop!</review>

<review id="5721">In addition to the price hike, be aware that many users cannot install TurboTax 2008 due to unhandled errors involving .NET and the Microsoft installer tool Intuit uses. It's become bad enough that you can read online tech columns describing frustrated users contacting them for help or to complain. Lots of forum postings on this as well.Because they have no working solution and many of the .NET errors are of the "Unexpected Error" type (no informative reason is given by .NET framework), Intuit has created a mailing list for all the users with this problem.Many of the help pages (with suggestions that don't work) have links where you can sign up for this "can't install" mailing list.The idea is that when they figure out how to use .NET effectively, they will notify users on that mailing list so they can install the purchased product.To get a refund quickly and easily, call your credit card company and file a dispute for funds paid for goods-not-received.Perhaps try TaxCut or if you have a simple situation, TaxACT [deluxe] is likely all you need.</review>

<review id="5722">Unbelievable! My experience started with having to call an Intuit phone number and spend a half hour giving all kinds of information to an operator.I upgraded from QuickBooks 2006 - specifically because downloading transactions was not as smooth as Quicken. I hoped that Intuit could improve downloading in three years. THEY MADE IT WORSE!!!

<review id="5723">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      So let me get this straight... i just spent two and a half hour watching a GM commercial with mediocre actors, unrealistic 'transformations' of robots (although the digital effects are superb but once you've seen the first one it gets old).... and I had to pay for this. The acting was horrible -- the cars not much to look at and the robots all look the same to me.

<review id="5725">I was considering ordering the Pedi Paws product through Pedi Paws/as seen on tv site but decided against it. What happened was that I entered my credit info but never pressed the submit/checkout tab, I just closed the window out. A week and a half later I received a package showing Pedi Paws. I contacted customer service to question how my credit info was processed without my approval.  The customer service agent that I spoke to was rude and unprofessional.  They said that if I sent it back my credit card would be refunded.  Hopefully this will be resolved.  It's scary to think that your credit card can be charged without your authorization.  I'm already leary of this sort of thing, and this just validates my worry.  Do not enter any information in unless you truly want this product.</review>

<review id="5726">I am incredibly disappointed in my Flip Video Camera.  After 2 conversations with customer support, with each one telling us the other one was wrong, I still can't get more than a whisper of sound coming from the Flip Camera.  We have the volume turned up, the camera is 3 feet away from the subject matter who is talking in a normal voice, it's inside so no extraneous noises and you have to hold the camera up to your ear to hear anything.  When the video is downloaded you have to turn the volume on your computer all the way up to hear it.  No one at Flip can seem to take care of the problem.  I would not recommend this product at all!</review>

<review id="5727">I've had much smaller and older flash drives that have worked 1000 times better and faster than this. I want to find one as good as those but larger. This isn't it. When I copy my "My Documents" folder to my other external hard drives and flash drives, it takes around 4-10 minutes. Copying to this unit takes an hour! And it took nearly that long to delete the folder from this unit! What's that about?Also, it is saying it is full even though when I check the size of the folder on the unit it is about 2GB and this unit is 4GB. The pie chart shows it's full but the folder of files on the unit says half that. Again, what's THAT about?This thing is going back and I'll probably avoid Kingston in my search for a decent flash drive.</review>

<review id="5728">the shipping was ok, but the product is not ok. Every time I connect it to any PC the found new hardware wizard appears asking me for the driver.

<review id="5729">I am disgusted by this book and won't finish reading it.  If I hadn't thrown out the receipt, I would return it immediately.This man uses his own fear and ignorance to control his wife.  Note to the author:  rather than having your wife give up her interests that you are afraid of, or as you put it 'couldn't act on your natural instincts to protect her' like when she was scuba diving, why don't you try being a real man and give her the space to cultivate her interests??  Or why don't you you get certified??  Don't try to pass off your neanderthal mentality as being a man when you aren't supporting your woman.</review>

<review id="5730">I didn't have much luck with this.  The heating element only worked half the time and the whole K-Cup system seemed designed to rip off the customer (I can see it's convenience though).  It's been mentioned, but if you drink more than 8oz of coffee in the morning, this will irritate you to no end.

<review id="5731">I loved the first three books, but this one was an utter disappointment. The story is completely off the wall, and the writing style is terrible. (It's almost like it were written by a different author than the other books.) The descriptions of events in the book are graphic, gross, and far away from the romantic triumph the fandom was looking for. Even the final battle scenes were totally lame and unconvincing. It wasn't even worth reading. For best results, get the first three books in the series, then write your own ending - it's bound to be better than this.</review>

<review id="5733">I consider myself a Twilight fan. I love the books and since reading the first one have bought the other three the day they came out. I was extremely excited about the movie, and went to see it opening night. My first thought by the halfway point of the movie was: WHY DID I SPEND MONEY ON THIS?!!!!!!!!Twilight: The Movie is a horrible, campy, tacky, CHEAP vampire story that swallows almost all of the power of the novels. The vampire special effects are even WORSE than "Queen of the Damned" (which is hard to achieve), and the "action" scenes were scripted, confusing, and in some cases pointless and lame.The acting was off and it was awful. Kristin Stewart was weak and ineffectual as Bella. She portrays none of Bella's strengths and instead presents her as, essentially, a weakling, a coward and a whiner. Rob Pattinson's Edward is kind of creepy, kind of tacky, and completely unromantic; in fact, he's kind of off-putting. None of the Cullens act like they're supposed to except Rosalie and Alice, so of course they only got about five lines each in the entire movie.The worst acting choice was whoever played Charlie -- he's a dead fish in the entire movie. He never displays ANY emotion. Now, in the books Charlie IS kind of closed-off, but he DOES get upset -- like when Bella says she's running away, for instance. In the movie, he's quiet and unmoved and seems to say nothing but "Oh, my daughter's running away. Don't go, Bella. Please stay, Bella. Wonder what's on TV?"However, first and foremost, the love story element was RUINED by the script. Bella and Edward are awkward as can be together, and at one point Edward makes the cryptic comment "It would be better for you if we weren't friends." Now, at this point in the movie, he's been nothing but a supreme jerk to Bella at every turn. If I were Bella, my response would have been: 'What?! We AREN'T friends! You're a creeper and you need to go before I call the cops! Stranger danger! [Makes sign of the cross]'By the time they're 'together' as a couple it feels so rushed and unnatural that you have to gag at some of Bella's more romantic thoughts, which make perfect sense in the book. One of the worst mistakes they made was combining about five different important scenes and shortening them into one confusing scene: the meadow scene, combined with the first running scene, combined with the skipping class scene, combined with three other minor scenes. It was rushed, confusing, creepy, unromantic, weird, badly acted, badly shot, and badly directed.The dynamic of Bella and Edward was ruined -- Edward is supposed to be so supremely larger than life to Bella; for instance, in the book when he runs (he's supposed to look like a blur, which the movie of course killed off right away) with Bella the first time she's violently ill and can't stand for a moment. In the movie she just hops off his back as if to say 'Alright, I do this all the time.'In the book, James, the villain, is actually rather terrifying. In the movie...okay, the actor is admittedly very attractive. But -- have you ever seen the movie "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" (NOT the show, because the show was amazing; the movie was awful)? You know, where Rutger Hauer played the most CAMPY, RIDICULOUS vampire EVER? Well, James almost TOPS his performance in "Buffy" -- again, VERY hard to achieve.Another point of unintended comedy? Bella and Edward spend half the friggin' movie in a TREE. Why? NO ONE KNOWS. He calls her "spider monkey," for the love of GOD. It's SILLY! And then when the Cullens jump at the 'bad vampires'? It looks like they're about to perform the song and dance "fight" in the first scene of "West Side Story!" How utterly absurd!The casting was awful, the acting was awful, the script was awful, the special effects were AWFUL. Possibly the only good points about this movie was the first five minutes, which actually did a very good job for some strange reason, and the last five minutes, which also did a very good job, for some strange reason. Every other minute of the movie was excruciating in its mediocrity.I pray to God every day that people don't watch this D-Grade piece of CRAP movie and go away thinking to themselves, "Well, now I KNOW I'll never read 'Twilight' after watching THAT crap."</review>

<review id="5734">Well I bought this based on: it had a good layout, nice feel, and cool backlight.A few months later I discover that there is a fundamental flaw, however:Eventually, if you do not strike the keys precisely on-center, they have a tendency to "get stuck" on the mechanism underneath.  This is quite frustrating, to be typing along, and suddenly come to a halt because you just bashed your finger on a key that isn't moving down.So, unfortunately, I am on the search for another keyboard already.</review>

<review id="5736">I don't think this is a problem that everyone needs to worry about, but one of my PC's on my network is my company laptop, and I use it to log on to the corporate VPN and access applications on my company's network.  When connected to this Router either through one of the ethernet connections or wirelessly, I could not connect to the VPN.  I tried calling the Dlink support line, but the things they told me to try did not help with the problem.  Accessing the internet was not a problem, so it would have been fine if I did not need a more complete solution.  After 2 weeks of trying different things, some suggested by my company's network folks, I decided to take advantage of Amazon's return policy.  I think there was something about this router that was just not compatible with what I needed it to do.   I reconfigured my old wired Linksys Router, which allowed the VPN connection, no problems, and did some research on the internet, decided to add a Wireless Access Point (linksys) to my existing wired router, again ordered from Amazon, should I need to return it.  But no need. It works great, took about 10 minutes to setup, and no problems getting to the VPN, and we finally have the option to connect wirelessly, which also works great.  So, if at first you don't succeed, try, try, again........</review>

<review id="5737">Interface is awful...and I'm a tech guru yet I still need to have the instructions always with me.  It also resets itself when changing batteries so you'll have to painfully reprogram it every time.  However, it did work for a year and 3 months...so I was satisfied.  But, last week it stopped dispensing.  I had taken good care of the product but since it was 3 months past the year warranty, Petmate would do nothing.  They wouldn't even let me send it in to have it service (at my cost).  They told me I should go out and buy another one and didn't seem at all concerned or surprised that mine had broke (it's clear they have had serious problems).  So basically you are buying a non-serviceable product.  If it breaks one day after 1 year...throw it in the trash. They will do nothing. Oh, and they have a new one coming out...it's white and looks to have a new interface.  I asked about it and they would not give me any info on ETA.  They are obviously hoping to sell their warehouse full of older, defective ones.Again, like other positive reviews I was somewhat satisfied while it was working...it's a needed product.  But after mine suddenly broke and dealing with their customer service, I don't have confidence in this product.  If I'm traveling for a weekend or a week, I would not trust this product to stay working.  And trust me, it was not batteries or anything I had done...it just stopped working...I've tried brand new batteries twice now and reprogrammed it a million times...it looks like everything should work but when the programmed time comes, it just does nothing.I told Petmate I'd be writing a negative review, they said they didn't care.</review>

<review id="5742">The absence of FireWire is a major flaw.The aluminum Macbook is a non-starter due to no Firewire. Removing Firewire is like taking all the Philips screwdrivers out of a toolbox.Thousands of devices are Firewire only, with more coming out all the time.Some FireWire advantages are:True Target Disk Mode (ethernet can be used ONLY if the 'Bad' machine will boot)FireWire can be daisy chainedBus Power - FW - Up to 30V/45W vs USB 5V/500mAPeer to Peer Connections (no host or CPU required)Multiple Host on a bus supportTCP/IP Networking supportNo Drivers Required (config ROM built in) aka Plug and PlayRemote Control of devices like camerasCableTV Box SupportYou can't transfer a VHS tape or other Video tape using an Analog-to-DV Converter without FirewireDMA transfers - device to device data transfer no CPU involvedFirewire allows two operating modes. One is asynchronous, like USB which suffers from latency, bus contention and collisions.The other is isochronous mode, and it lets a device carve out a certain dedicated amount of bandwidth that other devices can't touch. It gets a certain number of time slices each second all its own. The advantages for audio/video should be obvious: that stream of data can just keep on flowing, and as long as there isn't more bandwidth demand than the wire can handle, nothing will interfere with it. No collisions, no glitches. Firewire is Rock Solid.There are no USB to Firewire adapters. (Desperate aluminum Macbook owners are looking, but it can't be done.)The Macbook Pro has Firewire, but many don't want a 15" Macbook Pro, because of the large size. They want something more portable.The aluminum MacBook has no slot for an Express Card. There's NO WAY to connect any Firewire device to the new MacBooks...period.Keep in mind that when Apple dropped ADB, SCSI and floppy drives in the Mac at least there where alternatives. USB floppy drives and usb to ABD adapters that protected your investment. There is NO option to connect existing or future Firewire products to the new aluminum Macbook.It will be interesting to see what happens in the first revision of the new MacBooks. The original MacBook Pros didn't have Firewire 800, but Firewire 800 was added in the first revision after many complaints.Firewire is continuing to improve. (Firewire 3200 will be out soon.) Firewire is more relevant than it ever has been.Most would be better off with the White MacBook (that comes with Firewire). They're slightly faster and cheaper than the low end aluminum Macbook. The White Macbook is a good machine, good value and a great deal.Apple has always been a visionary company, leading the way in new technology adoption. This one has me scratching my head. They have removed a mature, ubiquitous and robust protocol and replaced it with... NOTHING!</review>

You must pay for shipping when it's replaced, and must pay to return the lemon replacement. When you run out of patience, you are stuck with a non-working router. Belkin is better and has a 30-day return policy. I would never buy another LinkSys.</review>

I am not blaming Amazon for the product, but, for me, out of the last year I have made 1 good loaf of bread, all the others have been door stoppers.  To be fair, I purchased a Panasonic about 3 months ago just to make sure it wasn't my mixing and ingreadents, well, the Panasonic comes out great everytime, the Z... it leaves me with a heavy brick of lopsided bread.  Ive tried many types, all fresh ingredents, flower, yeast everything.  I have communicated with the Bakers Catalogue and got some suggestions but then again today, I baked standard raisin bread, one in the Panasonic, one  in the Z and the Z looks like a short stubby brick, I give up, I'd love to send it back but of course, it's to late..

<review id="5753">I only used the camcorder once and recorded about 35 minutes of video.  I was impressed with the quality of both the video and sound.  It played back really well on my television, but when I tried to download the videos to computer I got audio but was NEVER able to obtain video.  Although I followed the manufacturers directions for downloading the video files, which required downloading the software to my computer, it never worked.  The problem was most likely in the camcorder software itself because after attempting to download several times the camera will no longer even come on.  Upon contacting customer support they insisted that it was not a problem with the camcorder but was a problem with my batteries.  However, I changed batteries 5 times to make sure the batteries were fresh and it still would not work. And I still do not have my videos.  I sent the camera back.  Although the concept is a good one, I think I'll stick to a higher-end camera.</review>

<review id="5755">Fooled into thinking this is the best product around.the product was intentionally designed with a flaw to destroy the moter and force one to buy a new one. (why else would the company sell the motors and offer them as soon as the item was produced).  Any intelligent engineer would have designed the product to have the filter BEFORE the motor, insuring the motor stays clean as well as the output water.  we have to clean out the moter every 6-8 weeks so that it doesn't burn out from being clogged from dust and cat hair.

<review id="5757">I consider myself a fan of the earlier books and I was there purchasing Breaking Dawn the day it was released.  I feel that this book was a tremendous let down in the way it ended the series.  As a grown woman, I have always been annoyed with the puritanical (or Mormon, it seems) views on sexuality; vampires are widely considered erotic creatures, and the absence of anything sexual in the first 3 books undermines the idea of Edward and Bella's obsessive love for one another.  All that intensity  and "I can't live without you," missives are capped off with chaste kisses or hand holding.  It's not that I was expecting anything too graphic, but the message of the author stating it's only OK for teens to have sex is when they make the (brilliant) decision to marry at the wise old age of 18 does more harm than good to her younger readers.  So she presents us with a heroine who gets married to consummate the relationship, and then gets pregnant while on their honeymoon.  I realize this is fantasy, but I have yet to meet a single person who is mature enough to be both wife and mother in their teens.  The baby subplot, which actually constituted the ENTIRE plot, was stupid.  We finally make the protagonist a vampire, and instead of concentrating on the interesting ways her life has changed, she is reduced to being a boring housewife feeding a baby.  Bella has never been the strongest character in the series. She has always served as an object of worship and adoration for seemingly no reason, but I was hoping the transformation would have brought out some key insights to why she she is so universally revered.  As for Edward, where was he?  Yes, he's on practically every page telling Bella how beautiful she is, or how much he loves her, but where was his personality???  The bottom line is the series was entertaining in spite of being poorly written, but the conclusion was not a satisfying end to Bella's and Edward's story.</review>

I haven't noticed that it cycles on and off like the other reviews say, but it definitely does not heat evenly (or maybe that is just a result of my cheap pots), nor does it get a pot of water to an actual rolling boil.  It is lightweight and poor quality, but it works, so if all you're looking for is a temporary- or occasional-use hotplate, why spend more?  One good thing is that the heating element lifts up a little bit so that you can easily clean under it or put a spill-tray in.  And it does have a nice, sturdy cord.</review>

<review id="5764">The pros are that if your cat likes to drink from a faucet then your he will go crazy for the Drinkwell Fountain. It is also healthier for the cat because the water falling into the bowl helps to keep the water oxiginated. The cons are that if your cat doesn't like to drink out of the faucet then they may not like the splashing water. Yes, you can adjust the flow but even with it on low my cat was getting splashed in the face when he tried to drink from the bowl. My other cat simply refused to go near it. Also the instructions claim that due to the filter and the circulating water you would only have to clean it once a week. I found this to not be the case. Even with emptying the water and putting in fresh water every day the bowl was getting slimy after only 3 days and had to be scrubbed out.</review>

<review id="5765">I bought this router without checking reviews here and got DSL connection drops just like many other people on day 1. Firmware update did nothing and tech support is a joke. It also interfered with my cordless phone with clicking noise if I used the phone away from the base. I decided to test it by going into the advanced wireless setting in the configuration page at netgearrouter sign in page and disable the wireless transmission. Lo and behold, the DSL connection drops stop and my cordless phone noise disappears. But now I don't have wireless connection which I wanted when I bought this router in the first place. I think this router wireless transmission frequency somehow interferes with the telephone line which, in turns, drops the DSL connection. I just want to post this for the people who could not return the router so they know that they can still use it for a wired network if they have internet connection drops. For those who is thinking about buying it, my advice is to buy another router instead.</review>

<review id="5766">I really liked the first two books in the series, Twilight and New Moon, and because I had grown to love most of the characters in the story, I was eager to read Eclipse to find out what fate had in store for them all.However, by the end of it, I feel like I had been thoroughly tricked by the first two books into believing that this was a story about an amazing, eternal, true-love bond between Bella and Edward.  I now feel that this whole thing is a very one-sided love story.  And I was extremely disappointed to find this out, to say the least.  I should've know that the spoiled, shallow, selfish heroin of the book could not possibly return the depth of love and commitment that Edward had for her.  But because that is what had been professed time and time again, throughout the series, I chose to believe that I was mistaken.This, the third in the series, has Bella having trouble deciding who she wants to be with forever: Edward, or Jacob. (?!).  She doesn't seem to mind hurting Edward again and again with all the affection she bestows on, and all the time she spends with, her werewolf "friend".  And then, what do you know, she ends up realizing that she is "in love" with BOTH of them!  So, when she finally realizes that she wants both of them, and can't get her way this time, she has to very painfully and begrudgingly decide to chose Edward.  Only because she realizes that, like a drug, she cannot be without him without causing herself pain...ah, true love.In the end, I just felt very sorry for Edward.  And out of the three in this silly love triangle, the only one with integrity, sincerety, and real care, is sadly the one character who just sort of fades out of the story, becoming less and less a part of what I thought was the core of the whole saga.The most frustrating part for me is, I don't think Meyer intended this to be a tragedy for the pair.  She continues til the end, (despite all that Bella feels and does), trying to convince us that this is real love.  I really wanted to believe it.  But, unfortunately, we are not all as shallow as her main character, and aren't buying it.</review>

<review id="5768">This review is from: Gone with the Wind (Two-Disc Edition) (DVD)      I wonder what kind of reception GWTW would have gotten had it come out in 1945 and been about a love affair between a man and woman in Nazi Germany.  Imagine Rhett Butler as the dashing U-boat captain who constantly evades those pesky British destroyers in the North Atlantic.  Picture Scarlett O'hara as the totally self-absorbed Fraulein who can't quite figure out what is in all those trains leaving town for central Europe because she is too busy thinking about a party dress. Despite the cinematic qualities of the film - which are undeniable - I cannot get past the fact that it romanticizes a society based on an evil institution.

I compared the same transfer with my old PNY 1G USB flash drive. It took one minute less. This means that this Kingston Flash Drive is over 50% slower than its competitor PNY.</review>

<review id="5771">After reading all the reviews, I decided to purchase this sharpener over the Thanksgiving Day weekend thinking it would sharpen my Henckel knives.  However, after reading all the directions and trying it on several older practice knives, i've decided to return it after it ate through my knives and/or making the knives duller than I thought possible.Until they come up with a better electric sharpener or I choose to purchase the expensive Chef's Choice M130 Professional Knife Sharpener, I guess I'll be returning to my whetstone.</review>

<review id="5772">I really enjoyed this product... while it lasted. Sadly the old adage "you get what you pay for" applies. It lasted for 7 glorious egg mc muffin-like months THEN it just stopped working. The warranty had expired and I could no longer enjoy the egg goodness. I thought it was unusual and possibly a fluke but after some research I found out that this products failure is quite common. I contacted the company to no avail they did/would not reply. SO in conclusion, great idea, terrible implementation. Oh and USE NON-STICK SPRAY! The low price clearly does not allow for teflon.</review>

<review id="5773">This product may make great coffee but the auto shutoff feature limits the warmer to 4 hours of operation per brew, making it useless for all-day coffee drinkers. Basic programming and use features are OK. Coffee maker is tall which makes use under most kitchen cabinets difficult. Opening for pouring water in smaller than most.</review>

<review id="5774">This thing makes great coffee but after owning one for a few months I sold it on craigslist.  The pile of plastic cups you generate after a few weeks of usage is enough to drown someone in a mountain of single-serving guilt.  I've gone back to using my old coffee maker.</review>

<review id="5775">This attache usb 2.0 flash drive from PNY technologies was bought to transfer documents to another computer. When I plug it in I am asked for a driver. This does not come with one.

<review id="5776">All drives fail.  All of them.  Eventually.  What you want is a drive that isn't going to fail for a long time.  Ideally, longer than you plan to use it.  Alas, no such luck here.  I think I got 5, maybe 6 months use.  My feeling is that you should be able to get 2 years before failure becomes an issue.  So, that is why it is at a single star.  Because I make multiple backups, I'm not dead in the water so to speak, but I've still got some work to do.  Part of that includes going out and buying another drive.  Simpletech again?  No.  Again, they have to last longer than this.  Best that can be said?  Well, they work great... until they fail.</review>

<review id="5777">I purchased this bread machine to replace an older Toastmaster machine and have been so disappointed in it. I have had it at the repair center twice now in two months and have been given so many different excuses as to why my bread is not turning out. The latest one is that I am not making 2 lb. loaves and that is why I am getting ugly, uneven shaped bread. According to the dealer where this machine was purchased you can only make 2 lb. loaves in the Zojirushi. Also, unless I set the crust control to light the crust is very tough. I have had much better luck with the old Toastmaster and Breadman I have been hanging on to for my older daughters to take with them when they move out. I have owned a bread machine for about 15 years now and although I don't consider myself an expert I wouldn't consider myself a beginner either. I would never, ever recommend this product to anyone! You buy it, you better be able to eat a two pound loaf of crusty bread pretty quickly.</review>

<review id="5778">I'm very disappointed with Nights in Rodanthe.  Near the end, something about the ocean waves, the length of time remaining, the tone, made me think of Message in a Bottle (Kevin Costner).  I literally said out loud to the screen, "Don't go Message in a Bottle on me, please..."  But it did.In my opinion, it was a manipulative, damaging ending, poorly written........UPDATE.......After writing the above, I took a few minutes to read some of the other reviews, and discovered that Message in a Bottle was actually written by the same guy - Nicholas Sparks.  I hadn't realized that, and yet still had that "don't do that to me again" fear, as described above.To me, the reason both Sparks endings are such utter failures is that they seem forced onto the story.  Tacked on for effect.  Shock value.In a movie like Unfaithful, which also starred Richard Gere and Diane Lane, the tragic ending grows from within the story, and is a consequence of all that has come before, including the innermost thoughts, fears, actions, and failures of all the characters.  It is an organic part of the story, and it rings as true as the characters themselves.So Gere and Lane ***in Unfaithful*** showed us they have the ability to act together in ways that are genuinely compelling, that move us and change us and disturb us, in a movie that has a deeply tragic ending.But back to Rodanthe, in addition to my extreme disappointment as noted above, I found myself disliking other aspects of the movie, related mainly to writing and direction, like where a jump cut goes from normal sand and ocean waves to drastically visual-effected turquoise colored waves - in the same scene, on the same walk, along the same shore, at the same time.  Uneven acting as well, and unconvincing at times.  (Were the actors as irritated at the sub-par writing and scattered directing as I was, I wonder???)  Also, it was annoying and unrealistic to me that the hurricane was bearing down on them, and they knew it, yet supposedly they waited until it was upon them to close doors and shutters, etc.???  No.</review>

<review id="5779">I just finished this book, granted I am 53 years old.  But, why is a teenaged girl encouraged to spent her life worrying about boys.  Boys come and go, even the vampire and werewolf kind.  A college degree will stay with you.  No one can really save you other than yourself!  I was JUST like this poor fool, Bella in my early 20's.  It has taken me decades to figure out the truth of life, and a girl's salvation ain't in a boy!  Please.....there is more to life than losing yourself for eternity to a boy.  Buy real estate if you want to really be secure. This book is STRICTLY for the pre-teen/young teen crowd. It is not written above a 15 year old reader's level.  I found it trite  alot of the time.    Hope the film is funner......</review>

<review id="5780">I really hoped and watched every episode. With the last one being the worst and totally unnecessary.It is so sad that American can't make a decent representation of time of "Founding Fathers". The fantastic Mr. Giamatti is "starched" due to the idiotic, cartoon like direction and teleplay of John Adams. Can't they at least try to make these people human and show some of the true facts about these people.The funniest character, or should I say, Disney animated status was George Washington. Due to the poor directing and writing that was inflicted on a fine actor, I think in the Hall olf Presidents in Disneyland has their George Washington animated robot showing expression and movement that this statuesque character.So much of the depth, details, real struggles, real motives of these men were left out, making them and especially John Adams a humorless, pompous cliche maker, as if he had no thoughts but about the U.S. They also just slid over the slavery issues.The most puzzling and non-defined or man without a motive character was their poorly directed and define Thomas Jefferson. There was no way to have any feeling of who he really was and why he did what he did. Sometimes almost hippie like, an outsider, disinterested, turned into with no reason a egomaniacal playboy who just wanted to go to France and party and grasp the power of the country. Made no sense. I am sure the book must be excellent, but another failure of giving the Father's of our Country some humanity and dimensions. Read Gore Vidal's Burr and watch the characters come alive off the page.Poor John Adams, he got old and no body cared about him, too bad, so sad, so pompous and so untrue. I'm sure producer Hanks and whoever the director was just didn't have any guts to show who these people were. The best part was the costumes. jon</review>

<review id="5782">Last year's TaxCut 2007 Premium Federal + State + e-file software INCLUDED BOTH e-filing for the Federal return AND e-filing for 1-State return.This year, the 2008 version DOES NOT INCLUDE FREE e-filing for the state return!Last year I paid $59.95 for this version of the software. This year the software cost me $49.99,but now I have to shell out another $19.95 to e-file my state return! That's an increase of 16.66% over last year's version by the very same name!I am MOST disappointed in the fact that NO WHERE on the packaging does it say that e-filing for the state was not included, or that it would cost extra. I expected more from a reputable company as H&R Block, and feel that they have stooped to both deceptive and evasive advertising practices in order to improve their bottom line by short changing repeat customers.No matter how you cut it, I'm paying $10 more than I paid last year AND I got blind-sided by a company name I thought I knew and trusted!SOMEWHERE on the package it should have said e-filing for state returns is no longer included and will now cost an additional $19.95.I realize this is by no means equal in comparison to what Intuit has done to their TurboTax customers, but still, the makers of TaxCut should be held to the same standard, and therefore, they should be "called-out" for their most recent and deceptive pricing scheme!I rated this 1-star because I was a long term customer that was both deceived and let down by a company and product I thought was above this kind of nonsense!It made me feel like a parent reading a cereal box to see what's changed now that it says, "new and improved", when all you really find out is they cheapened the ingredients and reduced the amount you get in the box!</review>

<review id="5786">I have used TurboTax for 8 years now. I have continued to buy it just because they could bring my prior years info forward. I always think that will be easier. It never is. I hate this company. Their products always have glitches and it seems like they have one customer service person for the whole United States. I just got through to their "customer support" after holding for a whole hour. Guess what? Before my problem could be solved, the customer service person cut me off and the phone line went dead. If this was a one time event, it might be understandable. This is what I deal with every single year. They deserve to go out of business and I hope they do.</review>

<review id="5788">This re-defined, updated version of the original Battlestar Galactica had an enormous challenge to step outside of the shadow of the first series.  And it stepped up to the challenge and was really a riveting, inventive, great sci-fi series.  And then.... OMG!  Stupidity strikes before the Cylons do.  The cylons machines can look like any human being, and apparently also inject illusions.  by the end of season one, if there had been one more scene of the doctor (who sees and hears the non-existent cylon in his head) being caught in what appears to be lude scenes of self-gratification and lip pursing pretend make out sessions.... well, I was going to root for the cylons to simply wipe them all out.  Any person that enjoys sci-fi has the capacity to leap the boundary of the believable.  Sadly enough, there are too many moments of stupidity toward the end of the season to care whether you do or not.  Listening to the hardened soldiers say the word "Frag" and "Fragging" became simply laughable and a series with all the promise in the world quickly became a slow burning joke.  Don't waste your money.</review>

<review id="5790">I don't know what kind of hair this trimmer is supposed to cut, but it don't cut mine.  You can stick it in your nose until the battery dies (which actually is not such a long time), and you won't cut as much hair as you could with a pair of scissors in 10 seconds.  There's just no comparison.  This trimmer makes a lot of noise and painfully tugs on hairs, but it's all sound and fury.  Nothing much happens.  So, I'd say that unless you have tremors or something, you'd be much better off with a $3-pair of manicure scissors.  Do the job in 10 seconds.</review>

<review id="5793">This product is horrendous. After a few months it would crash my disks and then the drive itself eventually died. Zip disks as we all know are not [inexpensive] and the drive would continuously destroy them. This has cost me not only money but lost assignments and projects that were on the [disfunctional] disks. Iomega replaced my disfunctional drive with another one which ended up conking out on me as well. I use this drive also for my PC.

<review id="5800">I don't know if was a victim of bad luck or bad stock management i ordered 3 pack of 4gb hp usb drive and got a 3 pack of 2gb usb drive . I'm extremely disatisfied!</review>

<review id="5801">I first made a purchase of the 2GB model since I had never heard of Kingmax before and didn't want to risk big money on the 4GB model. After checking it out, I gave it to a friend and for all I know, it's still working. I ordered the 4GB model from thememstore and was pleased for all of the first month until the unit inexpicably died. I tried it on several systems, attempted to reformat but none of my systems were detecting the drive properly. I contacted Kingmax through their poorly constructed English webform, and was given the run around about trying this, then that, all of which did nothing. When I explained that I had troubleshooted everything, the e-mail reply I got was to return the product back to the seller. I contacted thememstore by phone and explained the situation. They issued an RMA and I mailed the drive back to them, confirmed shipping. Their policy of refunding return shipping took a few phone calls but eventually I was given a credit via Paypal, since the money order I was told I would be receiving was "in the mail".All in all, the return process was relatively pleasant. Unfortunately, from the other reviews I've read on the 4GB model, it seems Kingmax has a long way to go in order to improve product reliability. At the time I made my purchase however, the product was new and there weren't any reviews highlighting these problems. I guess it doesn't always pay to be innovative...</review>

<review id="5808">It looks great, feels great and is quiet and so easy to install. Those are your pluses. But 3 weeks later, I get an error that says "Delayed Write Failed... the data has been lost." I chat with support and they tell me "Any hard drive that you have sooner or later will go bad. It is a mechanical thing that they will wear out. When that happens can't be known. What happens if you need to use the drive for backup, it is only a backup drive if the data that you have on the drive is also somewhere else. If it is only on this drive then it is a archive." I was livid. I understand if after a 6 months, things start conking out and I should have made a triple backup, but 3 weeks? Plus I didn't even move the drive, it's been sitting pretty on my desk. My husband bought an iOmega a while ago and warned me that happened to him and I thought it was a fluke and he was probably unlucky. Including me, this makes 100% of the people I know who owned iomegas portable hdd dying on them. While the argument of hard drives will conk out eventually is understandable, i do not see this happening for desktops or laptop hard drives (talk about mobiles) -- which then I can only conclude is they use inferior quality resources to manufacture.bottomline - buy at your own risk and it's not a viable backup solution.</review>

<review id="5809">I purchased this item at a local retailer, anxiously took it home and opened the box.  To my dismay, the instructions were, `watch the video on our website before using this on your pet."  I have dial up internet at home.  Anyway, they instruct you to HOLD your pet until s/he becomes submissive (which is terrifying to most dogs) and acclimate them to the noise until the anxiety passes.  You are supposed to lean/lay over your pet and secure each nail with your thumb and forefinger.  Well, my Rottie is NOT tolerant to being pushed into submission, squished down to the floor while I'm grabbing at her nails.  Usually, she sits in front of me and holds out her paw for nail clipping.  This just doesn't work because of the angle you must hold the tool. (practically leaning over the dogs shoulder reaching around the neck or under the leg)After I finally wrestled her down (all 120 pounds), the anxiety over the light humming noise passed and I was able to get 2 fingers on 1 nail...I pressed her nail against the grinding wheel slowly, but, it stopped!  It doesn't have enough power to file the nails down!  2 "C" batteries just doesn't cut it.  Where's the AC adapter for this thing!?  What a terrible design!  It only adds a little curve or takes the edge off.  I can do this with a fingernail file while she sits in front of me with her paw in my hand! (without wrestling her into submission, laying on her, pinching her nails, getting my arm chewed on and bribing her with bacon).  Ugh, if you have a LONG time to spend on each nail, as I suspect you don't which is why you are thinking about purchasing a grinder, and you can get past the SMELL of the nail grinding (which even offended my dog) then maybe this would work for you. I expect it might work well if you have a small enough pet that you can position them without squishing them to submission.</review>

<review id="5810">I wanted this appliance for over a year and finally received one for a Christmas gift. The first thing I used it for was an omelet, which was admittedly very quick to beat eggs to an unbelievable fluff. Then there was the cheese. The Magic Bullet will, I hereby testify, LIQUIFY CHEESE. I attempted to chop some onions and even with practice (stop, shake, pulse, repeat) got a chunk of onion surrounded by onion paste.Gosh, this would make some killer baby food and would be fantastic for icy drinks. If you have any diamonds you want split, it just MIGHT do the job and probably won't even strain the motor. It's much too powerful and out-of-control for basic kitchen tasks like chopping and shredding cheese.Ease of cleanup is admittedly fantastic and I'm sure it will be nice for SOME things-I can see it as a coffee grinder-but I won't use it as my indispensible kitchen magician. For the small fortune you'll invest, buy a blender or food processor.</review>

<review id="5811">This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      We went to see this in the theater after seeing the previews the kids really wanted to see it. The animation is great, the underlying moral of the story is good (but missed by most kids) because the fact is this movie is boring. Yes, sorry to say but from a  kids point of view it was boring. Pixar does a great job making a robot seem human, but there is very very little talking and it takes forever for something to happen in the movie.  Come to think of it  nothing exciting ever happens. Nothing that will grab a small child's attention. The kids actually asked if the movie was going to be over soon, so we could leave.   This is the only movie they have ever said that at.  I love movies with an underlying moral to the story, but the animated ones should be FUN to watch.</review>

<review id="5812">I live in a mere 800 square feet apartment, yet this router seems to have a working range of barely 15 feet.  As soon as I take the laptop around the corner out of my bedroom and into the living room, the Internet connection is lost.  And this is with me placing the router a full 9 feet (the length of my USB cables between the router and my desktop) away from my PC towards the door going to my living room.The professional technician who installed the router and network card spent about 5 hours trying to tweak it, including downloading updated firmware from Linksys, but to no avail.  Finally he said that the signal just couldn't penetrate the two walls (bedroom and kitchen, kitchen and living room) it needs to get to the laptop!  He hinted, but wouldn't explicitly state, that this is just what you get with this G-protocol, the B-protocol is has better range but slower speeds.I'll call Linksys customer service about this tomorrow, but right now am very, very disappointed considering that this G-protocol equipment is much pricier than the B- stuff.  I could perhaps have had the bad luck to purchase a lemon, but somehow I doubt it.  Buyer beware!</review>

<review id="5813">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      "Transformers" is another entry in the Michael Bay "Big, Dumb" movie canon. It starts off OK with some good action and quirky humour but all the fun soon drains away amid confusing and repetitive fights scenes, dopey attempts to make the Autobots seem like regular guys, awkward attempts at romance, and a totally predictable 3rd act. But probably the biggest flaw the film has is that the battle between the Autobots and Decepticons is fundamentally uninteresting. "Transformers" has all that money can buy but no heart - and gives us no reason why we should care about these characters be they human or robot. A case study in the premise that "special effects do not a film make".</review>

<review id="5814">I have read the whole series of books and couldn't wait til the marathon of the whole first season on HBO this week. After watching the first 3 shows, I wish I had never taped it to watch in the first place. When I saw it was directed by Alan Ball I knew there would be sex in every scene (he directed most of the Six Feet Under episodes, so I expected it). I saw more sex in the first 3 episodes of this show than I remember reading about in the whole 8 books I read! To me the show is nothing like the books and even though the show isn't bad, the books are much better. I don't think I will watch the rest of the episodes because if I do I will never be able to read the books again. The books are much more humorous than the show, cleaner and not sleazy like the show. I couldn't wait for the next book of the series to come out because there was a lot of suspense, but the show...well, I just know it will be more weird sex scenes and not much suspense. I think you will either like the books or the show but not both.</review>

<review id="5815">This BPM is convenient to use, does quick measurements and provides comfortable pressure while during the measurement. However, compared to a manual reading with a sphygmanometer, the HEM-780N3 is around 8 to 12 mercury higher. I called technical support to inquire if they can tell me how to calibrate the reading but they gave me a scripted answer of how their manufacturing uses advanced calibration and that their machine is accurate. Well, the one I received was not accurate. I have compared it with another Omron and CVS BPMs and with a sphygmanometer. If not for the accuracy, this would have been a very good BPM.</review>

<review id="5818">I've been using Turbo Tax for almost 10 years now and have never felt the need to look elsewhere. Intuit's software usually works well, and is fairly easy to use (though it isn't an intuitive as it once was). I bought the Home & Business edition this year because I worked part of the year as a contractor, and also dabbled in the stock market a little, so I needed a more powerful version.I decided to do my girlfriend's taxes first, and just finished them up after only 45 minutes (Nothing more and a 1040 for her). Nice!But then I chose E-file and boy was I shocked when I finished entering in all her account information. It was going to cost over $65 to E-file her taxes through Intuit!!! After just paying $90 for the software a local store, I just couldn't believe it! Fortunately, they DO let you print out your return, so we'll be using a FREE E-File option from the IRS this year. After doing my taxes this year I am going to be seriously reconsidering my loyalty to Intuit.</review>

<review id="5819">it's a shame that companies nowadays think just go and buy a new one, even if you have warranty, it's a hard fight you have ti deal with and at the end they wont give you a replacement.Treat yourseal and buy Kingston instead.</review>

<review id="5823">7 years ago I purchased my first Kitchen Aid mixer. I had a beautiful Robin's Egg blue Artisan 5 quart and it was glorious! The one problem i had Kitchen Aid promptly replaced my machine. As my kitchen tasks got bigger I decided to go up to the professional 600 series. I have hated it since i got it. it just never worked as well as my smaller artisan. WEll last Christmas as I was making a batch of marshmallows( as I had done tons of times in my smaller mixer) it just stopped. Of course it was right after the warrinty ran out. So I took it for repair and it was going to cost $200, why????? Because they used a plastic casing and if one thing goes the whole box goes. Then i called Kitchen Aid and they told me that they would send me an invoice and if it was determined it was a manufacturing flaw it would be fixed, but if not which they doubted it was I would be responsible to pay for the repairs and shipping. I then found out that Kitchen aid had been sold. I have decided not to fix it but put the $200 towards another brand. This machine was a cheap peice of garbage that cost bme $400. Kitchen Aid of yesterday is not the same kitchen aid today!</review>

<review id="5824">I was so excited to get this mixer, I use them alot. Right away I didn't like that you have to hand wash the bowl and mixer, more work for me. Also it is loud and very heavy. I have arthritis and can not easily pick it up, but my husband couldn't either. So we had to find a place for it on the counter to stay which I prefer not to do. I used to take my other mixing unit out of the pantry to use. My old one was easy to put the ingredience in, this one is much more difficult.The controls are very stiff. You almost have to use two hands to have some control when using it. I was so disappointed with this unit, I wished I saved the money and just replaced what I had been using.</review>

<review id="5830">Intuit must think that they have a monopoly on tax return software.  The price made me blink, but after so many years of using Turbo Tax I just went ahead anyway and got it.  The price may have gone way up, but the quality of the software is falling like a rock through the sky.  It's slow, buggy, uses an obscene amount of memory for God knows what, and wouldn't even install properly without my resorting to about an hour of self help troubleshooting.  I pin my free time at $100/hour, so at that rate I certainly feel entitled to a bit of a refund and then some.I'll be investigating other products for next year.  Having ditched Quicken for GnuCash last year, I feel ready to cut the cord with TurboTax as well now.</review>

<review id="5834">The Omron HEM-650 is a blood pressure monitor that is placed on the wrist, to measure your blood pressure.  It has a liquid crystal display (LCD) to show your diastolic and systolic blood pressures, plus your pulse.Why did I buy this device?  After years of having routinely low blood pressure, something happened and, in January 2008, I was found to have high blood pressure.  My mother, who also has high blood pressure, had a doctor-recommended machine from AMD, and I began using that one, too, to monitor my pressure.  It is the kind that has a cuff to go on the arm, and you manually pump it up.In October 2008, I ended up on intravenous antibiotics for two weeks at home, with a nurse coming weekly to monitor my progress.  He had a neat blood pressure monitor, that went on the wrist, inflated itself, and was both easy to use and accurate (he had tested it against a manual arm-cuff one for a month, with very high agreement).  He had bought his, several years ago, at Radio Shack.  I checked, and they no longer carried them, and the company they had used no longer made them.  I searched on-line and in stores, and ended up choosing the Omron HEM-650 with Advanced Positioning Sensor.This monitor fits snugly on either wrist.  It has a big LCD monitor, and measurement reading is very easy.  It gives you all three readings -- diastolic, systolic, and pulse -- all at once.  Measurement time is fairly quick, although not as quick as that one from Radio Shack.I have now said several nice things about the device, but rated it one star?  Why?Two big reasons.  First of all, the stupid Advanced Positioning Sensor (APS) makes the device almost unworkable.  The instructions say that positioning of the cuff, and of the arm, are critical, during measurement.  I think this is a gimmick, as nobody worries about where your arm is when you get your blood pressure measured in the hospital or at your doctor's office, as long as you are relaxed and unmoving during the process.  The instructions say that the cuff must be held right over your heart, with one hand holding your arm-of-measurement stationary during the procedure.  The APS ensures that the cuff is in the right location during measurement.However, if the APS is to be believed, there simply is no right location, most of the time.  Apply cuff, hit "Start," and put arm in the right position.  Nothing happens.  You shift position slightly.  Nothing.  Try again.  Nothing.  Ten minutes later, after numerous attempts to find the correct location, you're thinking about where you left your rubber mallet, so that you can beat the monitor into submission.Secondly, on the few occasions we were able to actually get this thing to work, I found the accuracy to be highly questionable.  The first time it worked for me, it gave me a high reading (145/97) and I immediately double-checked that.  First, I finally got this monitor to measure me again, and the result was 116/78, less than ten minutes after that first reading.  Another monitor, my old one, yielded 119/82.  Where did that first reading come from?  This weird-reading phenomenon repeated itself today, with my father getting 151/77 and 127/81 within ten minutes (of frustrating attempts) of each other, with the other monitor giving 121/78.I received this as a present from my parents, and we all agreed today that go back, it must do.  I tend to be a stubborn buyer; I buy cautiously, then really try to stick with my purchase.  I am the same way with gifts.  But, at over 63 dollars, this one was definitely not a keeper.-- Chris McCallister, author of Coming Full Circle</review>

<review id="5835">I was supposed to buy the other Western Digital 1 TB but accidentally bought this one and it happened just like the others said.  Plug it in light comes on but nothing else happens and tried it on multiple computers.  I tried it about 100 times determined to get my money's worth and through out all those tries it showed up on the computer exactly 1 time.  Convinced that it had started working I dragged a couple files into it (like a minuscule 200 mb... I'm no fool!) and left it alone for like a day and lo and behold the next day the power light was off for some odd reason (computer was still on) and it went back to being dead.  I'm upset...This is the type of stuff I'm talking about....don't make no sense.  Oh well it's going back to the store where I bought it...cuz that one that I have is Gobbage.  Maybe I'll try a 500 gig even though I don't think that's enough.</review>

<review id="5836">I was extremely disappointed in this book.  I really enjoyed the first three books in the series.  I felt a lot was lost in the 4th book just to make sure that everything was absolutely perfect and tied up with a neat little bow.</review>

<review id="5837">This thing is great. Without it, I could never see all those hairs up there.

<review id="5838">Useless, considering it's 3 times more expensive than competing products, you'd expect it to have more flexibility. I have an A/V unit that needs to be upgraded via the RS-232 serial port -- it has the same extruding bolts on each side of the interface. Thanks to that, this product, which could have worked perfectly, is now blocked by this useless piece of non-removable metal! It's even soldered in. I don't understand how manufacturer's don't have a bit more foresight in a mass produced product. How dissappointing!</review>

<review id="5839">The pedometer itself is pretty good.... however, mine did not come with a battery. The instruction manual said that a battery was included. Since it was a weekend, I went out and bought a battery for $3.99. On Monday I called customer service at Omron and informed them of my missing battery. They said I had to return the unit to them for them to install a battery and ship it back to me. I told them I had already bought the battery and I wanted a credit or another battery to use when the current one expires. They said, "Sorry, you have to return the whole unit." I told them that was the dumbest thing I ever heard.... spent $5 to ship and be without the unit for at least a week. "Sorry, you have to return the whole unit." The next day I called back and asked to speak to a manager... got the same story, except they would send me a pre-paid mailer. NO THANKS! I may never see the unit again the way this company operates.</review>

<review id="5841">I thought it was just me that finished this book feeling strangely unsatisfied. I thought something was wrong with me. Have I become so cynical about love and happy endings from my own personal life that I wanted Meyer to ruin my beloved Bella & Edward?? After reading the reviews of my fellow Twilighters, I am relieved it's not just me! I'm not crazy or bitter!We all got what we wanted. Bella & Edward forever! But here's the problem: they didn't earn it. When you travel through books with characters and have to watch them struggle and fight and suffer, you want nothing more than for them to get their reward. Bella had none of that. Her one struggle was the pregnancy. I questioned the whole pregnancy thing, too. It's just too soap opera, too easy a plot twist. But when she introduced the idea that Edward didn't want the baby, I thought, here, at last! A final battle for Bella and Edward. Could their love survive such a personal, life-changing dilemma? That was the most exciting part of the book hands down. I was gripping the sides of those pages, ready to tear them apart if poor Bella didn't make it! But she did. So did the baby. And she instantly became a "vegetarian." At that moment, Bella was no longer relatable to us normal humans. Because life is hard...nobody gets everything they want. Things NEVER work out exactly how you want them to. That's LIFE. The rest of the book became far too foreign. I think that is the bottom line problem of this book: the heroine no longer connected to her audience.And that fact changed the entire dynamic of the rest of the characters. Reneesme (still can't get over that mouthful of a name!) became Bella's #1 priority. Edward had taken a backseat. I can imagine how that might happen to women after they become mothers, but it was disappointing when you went through 3 books SOLELY about the love between Edward & Bella.I can get past the unlikely pregnancy. But I think that everything after the birth showed that Meyers really ISN'T a good writer. I LOVED the first three books. Devoured each book in about a day's time! I don't need some impressively difficult dialogue or descriptions...some fancy-schmancy tricky narrative. To me a good book is measured by only this: Did you want to keep reading? and, Would you read it again? So I didn't care that people called my Twilight books "fluff." They entertain! That's the whole point of telling stories! But Meyers proved she's a novice by trying to make this series more than it is. It's a fun romance. That's all. And there's nothing wrong with that. So why did she feel the need to drag us into some big Vampire battle, and then not even stage it? We read these books to hear the stories of Edward & Bella. We want to know about THEM. We were cheated out of all of our Edward & Bella time. Their story ended after the birth, and it became the story of Reneesme. And where I felt VERY cheated, was with the vampires we already knew and loved: THE CULLENS. I was so interested to finally hear Rosalie and Jasper's stories in Book 3. I was excited to see them all be further developed in the final book. Man was I JIPPED! They were barely present. Instead we got a whole mess of new vampires. She completely lost me there. I couldn't name a member of the Volturi if my life depended on it. I skimmed probably the last 150+ pages. All of that preparation for the battle stuff, I had no interest in. I only wanted to know if Bella & Edward survived. But the real suspense I had felt earlier was gone. It would have been MUCH better if she had just focused on Bella & Edward and her adaptation from human to vampire. We didn't need some grand Vampire saga. We only needed the characters we loved. But sadly they were missing. The only one who was still there was Jacob, and as he was no longer important to Bella, it didn't make anything better. I read the partial draft of "Midnight Sun," and I was much more intrigued by it than I was by "Breaking Dawn." It is so much more interesting to see how our beloved Cullens deal with this big change in their immortal lives, especially when Alice can see where it's all going! Hopefully Meyers will end the series on a better note and complete it. I think the majority of fans will be a lot happier if she does. The only spinoffs I would read of this series would be ones written by one of the Cullens. If it's about Jacob or Reneesmee, I have no interest in it.We all want a happy ending. But happy endings with those who didn't earn it? Those are VILLAINS, not HEROES.</review>

<review id="5842">I was really disapointed with product in more than one way. First off the movie desrves like a million stars but this does not. If you want to buy it save yourself money on the onew disk one because the special features are just a bad joke. So unless you want a digital copy (which I do enjoy) get the one disk. Also this was supposed to arrive on the 10th of decmber it didn't arrive till the 13th, it was only  days but 3 days i had to wait longer so the shipping absolutley deserves negative stars just like the special features. But once again do get the one disk edition of the movie because the movie itself is amazing and if i was rating the movie not the product it would have 5 stars not one.</review>

<review id="5859">Drinkwell 3-Brush Cleaning KitI was very disappointed in these brushes.  The bristles and sponge on the large and medium brushes do not extend to the end of the wire and so do not clean the bottom, edges and inner corners of the fountain.

<review id="5860">Kirk Cameron and a couple of other actors were acceptably solid, but most of the rest of the cast was straight from the church drama club. This movie at best is a TV movie and more relevant as a DVD available through your church as a freebie or for a nominal fee. The sound quality was poor; I had to turn the volume up high. *Spoiler alert*: The message is fine. And the yelling scenes and the issues were right on the money. Trust me..wives can scream just like that too. The conversion was a little too simplistic, but I guess that's to be expected in a 2 hour movie.  What struck me was that Caleb apologized to Catherine but she never apologized to him.  She just accepted his apology and said she loved him. She was just as guilty as he was.  I guess her conversion/acceptance is just implied after they have reconciled. I wish the dare would work this well in real life. However, if both husband and wife are not fully committed to trying to save the marriage, it probably won't work. It takes two to stay married, but only one to get a divorce.As an aside, three out of five people in that firehouse were obese. Surely, the percentage in the real world of firehouses is not that "heavy". Overall, the movie was just fair. As a movie, it was predictable and mediocre. As a message, it's one that I hope all couples embrace early in their marriage.</review>

<review id="5861">This item has gotten one star, simply because there is no provision in the review format for zero stars or negative stars, which it richly deserves. It jams, it chokes, it's a bother to clean...putting it kindly...but if you're attempting to grind pork for sausage you'll find yourself cleaning out where it's gummed itself up it after every few pieces. Which means, overall, that using a hand-cranked grinder like a Porkert is far less work than this ( let's remember this is a family audience) ...thing. The cutter and the plate are made of cheap stamped metal and they don't work nearly as well as the old and long-gone all-metal version of this attachment. I was warned not to get one of these and instead look for an older set used, advice I wish I had taken. Save yourself the time and trouble and get yourself a good old hand crank meat grinder, just like Grandma had.</review>

<review id="5862">I requested this sheet on my registry.  When I received it I was quite disappointed at how flimsy the sheet was.  I also didn't care for how easily it comes off of the pad.

<review id="5863">I ordered this item the Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router last week and at the time the Delivery estimate was July 7, 2008, now that it's July 8th, when I look at the web page, my Delivery estimate has been changed to July 14, 2008.  The item was ordered on July 2 and listed in-stock and at the time it said delivery would take 3-5 business days, so even allowing for the 4th of July  holiday, it should be delivered no later than July 10th. I know giving a bad review is a little pre-mature at this stage, but I've searched everywhere and there doesn't appear to be any e-mail address to send a comment or a concern to and the only email address I can find just has an auto-reply. So if I can not contact the seller, this is the only other option I can find!! If I do receive the item in the next day or two I'll remove this, but changing the delivery estimate date and not providing an accessable email or contact number is very frustrating!!</review>

<review id="5864">I should have listened to the other reviews.  I couldn't get it to load.  It kept stopping and said it needed something for the C++ (whatever that is).

When it restarts it does the same thing all over again.  Amazon.com did let me return it.  I just got this PC.  It has VISTA Home Premium on it.</review>

<review id="5865">I tried this hub for two months with only one printer plugged in (HP CLJ2550L).  After approximately a half a day, the hub "goes to sleep" and the printer is not recognized.  The only solution I found was to unplug the power supply from the hub and plug it back in to "reboot" it.  This is inconvenient for me because I need to have the hub installed behind a desk where I cannot get to it easily.UPDATE (11 Sep. 2008)I replaced the D-Link hub with a Targus ACH82EU 7 port hub.  It has worked continuously for more than 10 days now without dropping any peripherals off-line.  It appears the D-Link hub was the problem.  Definitely not recommended.</review>

<review id="5866">I've bought Turbox Tax for years and often recommended it to others.  Thanks to the informative reviews I'll purchase another product this year and hopefully find a new product to recommend.  The ability to prepare 5 returns for the purchase price was reasonable, but this new pricing structure is plain old greed.  What next Intuit, extra money to balance my checkbook in Quicken each month?</review>

<review id="5868">this is not what I was looking for.  The style and weight looks like an old laptop. If you use it to replace desktop, it would be ok, otherwise find something else. I installed two more OSs, Fedora 10 and Ubuntu 8.10, I  had some trouble for doing that, but eventually I got there with initial boot loader error.  If you are pro for software development, get Dell M1330.  They are not the same price range, but the extra money is worth for the value you get.</review>

<review id="5869">My HD just died on me and lost a month worth of notes etc (after my last backup). This is after the battery, disc drive, and mainframe were replaced for failing, all at different times within the past 2 years. The tech support at the genius bar has been great (thank God I purchased an extended warranty), but it's just one thing after another with this computer. Apple's quality control has fallen from what it once was.</review>

<review id="5870">a friend has this pet bistro so i bought one to prepare for a two week vacation.  mine worked for one or two days and then stopped working.  the counter advanced however, so i didn't realize it wasn't working until my cat showed signs of extreme hunger.  she's always hungry, so it took a while to catch on.  luckily, i was able to borrow my friend's for the duration of the trip and it worked fine.  i will return mine for a replacement and hope for the best.  frustrating, though.  bottom line:  when it works, i have no complaints about this gizmo, but when it doesn't, all bets are off.  buyer beware.</review>

<review id="5871">Worst book of all four.  It was so thrown together.  The bit at the end with Edward and Bella's baby and Jacob is beyond STUPID.  I couldn't even finish the book I was so disappointed in the way it was thrown together just to get the series to an end.  It was really too bad for a series that had so much potential.  What a waste.....</review>

<review id="5872">Okay, okay - I should have paid attention to the other reviews about this product.  I am an IT pro and thought I wouldn't have the same issues.  Okay - I was wrong.  The router did setup nicely - no problems.  I had a little signal loss now and then - but nothing special.  But this morning - the 2.4 ghz band just died.  That's right - died - I couldn't get it back.  Did I mention I am an IT pro?  Every device hooked up through the 2.4ghz band couldn't connect anymore.  (2.4ghz is the main band.)  Spent hours rebooting / reconfiguring etc.  The 5 ghz band stayed up - no worries.Other things to note about this:Many people complain about heat -  I had it on a glass desk - no heat problems. You might want to try a surface like this.The USB for data drive is okay - requires passwords to be entered every time your computer books - kind of a pain.5ghz is not powerful. If you have a long distance, you won't be able to use 5ghz - by the way, this seems to be true with all 5ghz routers, not just this one.  I owned the smaller gigabit version of this and returned it - didn't have as many issues, but only had that one for a week - wanted the storage usb this one has.By the way, customer support is 100% worthless.  When I told the "tech" that the 2.4ghz band dropped but I still was getting the 5ghz band - he asked what I was talking about.  Told me there wasn't such a thing as a 5ghz band!  Thought I was talking about a computer or something!  Spent 30 min on hold, then 60 min with him.  In 60 min time we did absolutely nothing (except bring up the router menu!) I have always owned a Linksys - but had to return this.  I just went out and bought a D-Link DIR-825.  Has all the same bells and whistles, but so far it works!  The 2.4ghz seems stronger - full bars 2 rooms away - the 5ghz about the same and ths Linksys.  I haven't had any problems yet with this - but I guess time will tell.  (The reviews here in Amazon are much better for the D-Link by the way.If you are a die-hard Linksys guy like me, just be prepared to be disappointed.  Sorry Linksys, but you messed up this one.</review>

<review id="5873">I followed the directions that came with the mouthpiece (looks like an athletic mouthpiece that I use to wear in football and karate). I molded it to my mouth per instructions. I tried it. I sleep on my side probably 99 percent of the time, so I figured it might work. Still snored like a bear.  I reformed the mouthpiece again. [...] During the night, when you lower jaw relaxes, your mouth tends to open. That is where the problem begins. If there was a way to keep you lower jaw closed, maybe it might work. I sent my device back after two weeks. [...]</review>

<review id="5874">I've had several problems with this machine. First, it's clumsy to get the machine ready to brew. I have to slide it out to open the water reservoir, and then either use the carafe to pour the water in which makes a mess or use another container. You have to push the spout over the coffee before brewing or the mess is incredible. Coffee grounds and coffee everywhere. Next, when it brews it's hard to get the carafe in the right spot for the coffe to go in. Sometimes it's not in enough and the coffee overflows the basket. Sometimes it leaks out of the spout. The capacity is small. I rarely have enough coffee for four people when it is full.  Finally, the whole reason we got a thermal carafe was to keep the coffee hot. After an hour, the coffee is lukewarm at best. Even when it's fresh and hot - it's not really that hot. I love my Zojirushi rice maker, but the coffee maker is heading to freecycle.</review>

<review id="5875">I ordered a 2G surf to take with me while traveling.  I was so excited about getting a small, lightweight, easy to carry little computer!  The package got here, I opened it and set it up right away and then when I turned it on and the screen for the license agreement came up, I couldn't do anything - the touchpad wouldn't work at all.  I tried restarting, I called the ASUS support number, they had me press the reset button and start it up, press F9 to get back to the factory install settings, etc.  But nothing worked. A couple times when trying to type 'yes' to reboot - the keyboard wouldn't work either.  I need it soon for a trip - they wanted me to send it back to them to CA with one day shipping and then they said they would send me another one.  I checked and it would have cost me $89 to send it there with 1 day shipping.  I bought it through a 3rd party here for $249.  I could drive down the street and buy one for $299 from Target and it would cost less than sending this one back.  I called the shop from Amazon that I ordered it from and said I wanted to return it.  They said they will pick it up tomorrow.  Now I am really sad!  I was really looking forward to using this little guy!  Now I don't know if I want to take a chance with another one of these or not or find another brand of mini-notebook.On the plus side - it started up quickly, as far as the startup went anyway.  And I don't think the size of the keyboard would have bothered me.  I wanted small and sturdy and cheap - just to travel with now and then.  I didn't expect it to function like  a full laptop, but I expected it to at least work.</review>

<review id="5876">For people buying this with video in mind:I was initially excited on receiving my Coby media player, but now I feel burned. The manual instructions for Windows were completely wrong. None of the files or folders are named as in the instructions. Neither was the conversion software on the install disk. I'm not even sure what use the install disk was for at all. After spending hours talking to tech support, they were able to email me the conversion program. It was falsely advertised as playing AVI files, but instead relies on the outdated .mtv file. Their conversion software appears to convert the file into .mtv, yet the file still can't be run on the media player. Tech support reasoned that the 10 minute avi file could be too long for the player, yet the box claims it holds 16 hours of video.The tech support was not very helpful, hadn't a clue how to help me and suggested I return it for a refund. Hopefully that poses no trouble. But I did want to alert buyers that they're potentially purchasing an overpriced mp3 player, and that Coby perhaps knows already that their video program is broken (hence the cheap price).</review>

<review id="5877">I knew the company made too much profit one it, but still could not help buy got one at $390 at this beginning of the year after reading all the positive reviews.1. Bad technical support. Emailed two questions, no answer.2. Card reader constantly has error when it is hot in summer.3. Less powerful cpu (actual speed 600MHz). I added 2G memory. They are useless with such cpu. Cannot properly play the popular MKV format movie.4. It is small, but it does not fit my pocket. I don't see much difference with a normal laptop when carrying it for travel.5. The key board is too small. Those who has a PDA with mini key board knows it. 6. I am wondering whether all those positive reviews are from the true users.Wish I had bought a much powerful laptop at the same price I paid for this one.</review>

<review id="5878">I have used Huggies for four years and two children and have been very happy... until recently.  The Disney Babies pattern is terrible.  The dyes rub off on the baby's clothing, staining onsies (and all else that touches the diaper) blue.  It does not come off in the wash.  You will ruin clothing with these.</review>

<review id="5879">I purchased 2 of these sheets in the Saratoga print from the store.  I washed them several times and the fabric was still so rough and abrasive that I ended up returning them.  They do seem to be well made and were easy to put on and take off, which is the only reason I give 2 stars.  But if you prefer your baby to have something soft against his/her skin, buy some fabric and make you own; it's very easy and cost much less!</review>

<review id="5880">For the price of this gate I expected much more quality wise. My husband put the gate up at the top of the stairs on our landing, and followed the directions to a T. Well whenever we would be upstairs my daughter would stand on the gate and shake it with all of her might, and of course being the stubborn 19 months she is, I could not get her to stop doing this. Well after two weeks of doing this the part of the gate that attaches to the wall (the part that swings) ripped out of the wall. How a 2 yr old could do this I am not sure. My husband put it up again with larger anchors and screws but it looks like it is going to come out again. For $35 I expect much more.</review>

<review id="5881">The HIGHLY OVERRATED Sci-Fi Channel show.  Think "Beverly Hills 90210" rather than Battlestar.  SOOO different from the original, the name should have NEVER carried over.  It's not a 're-imagining', but a totally different story with elements of other Science Fictions shows thrown in.  I mean, if you "re-imagined" the sinking of the Titanic, would you actually call the ship the "Edmund Fitzgerald" which sank on it's last voyage in 1613 B.C. crossing the Mississippi River  due to hitting a discarded scoop of ice cream?  NO!  It WOULDN'T be about the TITANIC anymore.  The show MAY have been fine in it's own right, but the producers gave a lot of lip service to understanding the "valuable property" they had, and they would do things "right."  It was an attempt to cash in on the name while throwing away 98%  of the original, and keeping only the names and a couple of other concepts.If you like the original, stay away from here!</review>

<review id="5882">The Capresso 560 Burr Grinder did a good job grinding beans. however, it would leave a large amount of ground coffee in the grinder that did not drop into the container.

We are unable to remove the blades or use the grinder after only one month of use.</review>

<review id="5884">This is the third portable USB drive that I have purchased.  Each purchase was driven by the fact that I constantly needed to upgrade to one with more memory. At first this seems like something that had been well-designed, but within the first use I clearly saw that their product  designers/engineers no nothing about what a consumer looks for in this type of product. They were too busy putting the blue light up feature in that they completely ignored everything else. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SANDISK PRODUCT AGAIN.CONS: LID IS LOOSE, COMES WITH AN ADDITIONAL PLASTIC THING THAT HAS NO DESCRIPTION FOR WHAT IT IS FOR, DESIGNED THE KEY LOOP ON THE WRONG END OF THE PRODUCT (My previous Sony had an option to add the key attachment to either end, which is helpful so your keys aren't hanging off your computer), AND WORST OF ALL - THEY MARKET THIS PRODUCT TO BE FAST (HI-SPEED USB 2.0) Well my Sony USB was 2.0 as well and it was 4X's faster! I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT.</review>

<review id="5885">I loved it when I first got it... but after about two weeks... the casing started coming loose. Within a month, it was unable to be inserted into the computer because it was loose. A friend of mine was able to prolong its life for another couple months but then it died for no apparant reason. I still have the cover for it. I took great care of it considering that it was my only means of accessing a printer for school. This product sucks.</review>

<review id="5886">The readings from this machine made this cardiac patient extremely nervous. The readings were consistantly in the 170/105 range, so I scheduled a doctors appt. I took this alleged blood pressure monitor with me and took two readings with my machine, both ran in the range stated above. The doctor took his, 140/70, twice. Unnecessary tension and aggravation is not what I look for in a product; this one had loads of it.</review>

<review id="5887">I'm a huge fan of the books (have read them twice already) but the movie is one of the worst I've seen.  Too bad really because the great story gave it so much potential.  The first problem was that they didn't stick to the book and actually cut some of the best parts of it. If you have such a huge fan base, why change what we loved?   Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are perfect examples of not messing too much with a good thing.  The acting was just horrible. Where was the grace and elegance? No charming banter - no sexy strong confidence in Edward. What a waste. What was the author thinking I wonder.</review>

<review id="5888">I bought this about a year ago to upgrade from my netgear 802.11B router. I wanted the higher throughput (54mbps) and liked that it did WPA. My old router only did WEP64. I really liked my netgear router because it had good range and once i had it setup, it was rock solid. I almost never had to restart it because it had dropped my connection. With the WRT54G, however, I have to frequently power cycle it to have my laptop sync up to it. Also, with my WinXP machine there was an issue coming out of hibernation. Each time I had to "repair" the adapter. I never had to do this with my netgear router and the same Win XP laptop. I can imagine that it might be a WinXP driver issue, but I've had similar experiences with a newer Vista Laptop and in Linux as well (on both the older and newer laptops), so i highly doubt that it is a laptop hardware / driver issue.There is also an issue when i use VPN to connect to my office machine. I don't know what interaction with the router might be, but after I disconnect from the VPN, i lose wireless network connection. It doesn't matter what windows clean ups i perform (flushing dns, disabling wireless adapter and including restarting the machine) If i simply power-cycle the router, i am able to connect to it. So overall, i have a fairly low opinion of this product. I think I'll stick with netgear in the future.</review>

<review id="5889">Well, I agree with Avenger.  There is no need to buy this product until February, they won't have it ready until then.  If you are doing, say, and S corp, you start the program, select S corp, and then it just goes back to the start with an obscure "form not found" error.  If you contact support, they tell you it 'should' be ready on Jan. 31.  Until then, I have three aborted no-name returns on my system from my attempts.</review>

<review id="5890">All in all, this product is not quite the best USB Flash Drive I've owned. The Attache performs well enough for the price, but does indeed run a little slow on my older HP Pavillion ze2000. I had a I/O errors while trying to drag and drop files in mass (rather than one at a time). This is a little aggravating since as a web designer, I need to transfer multiple images between home and work.If you are a low tech user looking for something to store your photos for a family trip, this cheap flash drive will perform well enough out of the box to satisfy your needs. However, for you higher end tech junkies, put out for a little more expensive drive. PNY doesn't offer any drivers (unless you're running a system older than Windows 2000).It's worth stating that my laptop might be the source of the problems, but I doubt that since I have another flash drive working just fine. I'll experiment on some of my other computers to see what results I can get.During the duration of typing this review AND researching a few facts on the drive, I've been waiting to transfer a SINGLE 9KB image from the drives base folder to a new folder I created in order to organize things. I've got 4 more images to transfer, and if each of these takes just as long then I may just be seeing where to return this drive...When trying to transfer files, I note that the Windows Explorer freezes between 5-6 seconds. Sometimes you will get an I/O error, sometimes you won't. Take your risks with this device.</review>

<review id="5891">I was excited to receive the Zi6 HD based on the reviews I had read here and on various website.  However; when I actually got it I was less than thrilled.First, when I tried to insert a brand new 16GB SDHC Card, the eject mechanism in the camera was broken.  The card just slid in and kept on sliding... to the point I had to use tweezers to retrieve it.Next, I slipped the card in and knowing there was no working mechanism to stop the card, I got it to where the camera would actually acknowledge its presence.  I took a couple videos inside my home and outside on a sunny florida day.  The videos all looked washed out and since the camera lacks any optical focus, nothing was really sharp.I ended up packing it all back up and sending it back to Amazon.  To the credit of Amazon, they do make the return process very easy.  Just print a label and give it back to UPS.</review>

<review id="5892">I loved this thing the few months that it worked.  Used it to broadcast iTunes to my stereo.  When it died, I was very sad and ended up spending $80 and about 4 days running wire thru the walls of my house.</review>

<review id="5893">This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)      Tropic Thunder is not only absurd and terrible, it's actually down right boring, so much so that I fell asleep half way through and had to watch the second half when I woke up the next day.I used to be a big fan of stupid humor and some of those films still work for me but Tropic Thunder is not one of those films.  The jokes seem to to laugh at themselves and the script, well, let's not talk about the script.  Sure, it was creative, creative like a pot smoking monkey with a paintbrush.  Tropic Thunder certainly references the war movie genre often but I feel like it fails to actually satirize the things that are most essential to war films while spending way too much blowing Ben Stiller's hands to pieces.As you can tell, I'm rather unimpressed, which is a shame as I really wanted to have a great time with this film.  I'd give it a pass.</review>

<review id="5896">The interface is almost identical to the WRT54G.  The speed I was able to get topped out at 145Mbps because there are several wireless G networks nearby, so if you're buying it for the promised 300Mbps and you live near other G networks, don't bother.  Also, when my network activity gets heavy (i.e. torrents) the router will just disconnect.  This happens every few minutes as long as I'm not browsing.  If I'm downloading and browsing it drops more frequently.  This is extremely annoying because these disconnects last about 30 seconds.  I have the latest firmware and I the problem occurs from multiple computers.  If you do a search you'll find this is a common problem.  The final nail in the coffin is the lack of DD-WRT support (the last time I checked).  Don't waste your money.  If you have a fast connection and you like to use it, you will get disconnects.  I didn't believe it either because there were plenty of good reviews, but now I'm wishing I had done more research before purchasing.</review>

<review id="5897">My cats were fascinated by this water bowl even though i thought it looked like a baby toilet (maybe that's why they liked it??) They played in it more than drank from it for the first few days and made a mess! But, eventually they began to trust it and drank from it. By the 4th day, the cat hair they dropped (I have two cats) was constantly clogging the water intake at the bottom of the dish. This meant that not only was the water not circulating correctly, the water level would get very low even though the "tank" in back was full. It would make loud sucking noises that scared my cats and actually were loud enough to wake me up at night! So, this product probably works great for hairless cats, but for the rest of them...it's a lot of maintenance for a water dish.</review>

<review id="5898">This device failed after 3 months, losing important data. I have always treated this device with "kid gloves" so can only assume that it has been a manufacturing defect.  Up until this point I have been pleased with the drive.

<review id="5899">I have a 160gb Passport, plus 500gb and 750gb MyBooks and so I thought I was safe with the 500gb Passport. Failure on my Vista64 box was immediate. Actually it would let me begin copies before hosing things up. I tried formatting, reformatting - everything. Every time it was the same, if it even allowed me to begin the copy, it would start then freeze up. Returned - at least Amazon is head and shoulders above most etailers in handling returns. Gotta give them credit for that. Getting a MyBook 1tb raid instead.</review>

<review id="5900">Had to upgrade from QB Pro 2006 to 2009 because the email feature/service was going to expire - so this was a "mandatory" upgrade. I had hope that the new version would fix some of the annoyances of QB 2006. Sadly no. Still get nagged asking me to sign up for a payment processing service - even though I keep clicking "No Thanks". Still can't use the online backup service unless everyone is out of the file. Looking to get help with using the program? Good luck. The "Live Community" sounds interesting until you realize it's just another bunch of lost souls trying to offer tech support that should be coming from Intuit. Want to call Intuit to ask a question? Get out the credit card - it's going to cost you.Quickbooks does what it does very well, but this looks like just yet another money grab by Intuit. We only upgraded to keep the online backup and email service functioning. The rest of the changes do not justify the upgrade cost.My rating of two stars is more than generous. Save your money and skip this version. Seriously. Skip this version.</review>

<review id="5901">I bought this flash drive for school so that I can save and transfer my documents between home and work. I should have just continued to use the one I have.

Maybe I just got a defective drive...maybe.</review>

<review id="5902">This is the first Disney/Pixar movie I have seen that I felt was boring.  (I was checking my watching every ten minutes to see when it would be over.)  These are the reasons I did not like it: 1) It took too long for the story to get going--or for Wall-e to board the spaceship; 2) the characters lacked development--especially Wall-e who is the main character (I didn't feel anything for these characters: Wall-e, the Captain, etc.); and 3) this movie was filled with cliches, such as the Captain is going to rebel against the Higher Authority, insignificant Wall-e is going to save the day, we reap what we sow (or in this case the garbage that we made is the garbage that our planet turned into), etc.  I would have to say Wall-e is the first movie that I thought could NOT be enjoyed by both kids and adults.  For a much better environmental animated movie that is filled with original ideas, I highly recommend Spirits Away.</review>

<review id="5903">I bought this item from Amazon and withing 5 months it wouldn't heat up anymore.  There is no warranty.  It is worth the extra money to go through an authorized dealer.</review>

<review id="5905">After recording hours of lecture to convert a class to online, I realized when I looked at the slide timings that some of the slides - randomly - were cut off at 8 or 10 or 30 seconds, even though I had spoken for two minutes.  Now, you click a button to move onto the next slide, so it wasn't like there was anything wrong with the audio on my mac - of course not.  I wish Mac would check the quality of MS work, because it always sucks.  It was frustrating to read similar reviews of people in the same sitauation.  I wish I had read these reviews before I purchased this software.</review>

<review id="5906">I gave it one star because there wasn't anything lower.  Directions indicate that beginners should keep it at the lowest point in pressure at first.  I did and the water dripped out. Cranking it up a notch did nothing but empty out the water container quickly (maybe 20-25 seconds) although I'd filled it to capacity. There is a steady stream from the pik, the handle and the around the area where the pik attaches. It was a mess. Could be that I got a lemon, nevertheless, it's definitely going back.  Oh,one good thing about this item is that it seemed quiet enough during the few seconds it was on.</review>

<review id="5907">I AM SO DISSAPOINTED WITH THE NEW BABY DRY DIAPERS .I have been using Pampers cruisers for my son and have rarely had any leakage ..Maybe an occassional leak which is not bad.I was happy with Pampers.I decided to give "Baby Dry" a try bcos it claimed to have a more absorbent core to prevent night time leaks. I am sooo disappointed. The core seems to be WAAAAAYYY inferior to the Cruisers core and leaks !! I started using them  a few days back and my son has woken up atleast 5 nights crying bcos he was soaking wet !! :( This morning I was holding him and my shirt felt wet. The diaper was leaking and it went thru his clothes onto mine !!  So its not just about night time leaks. So much for absorbent core to prevent night time leaks. I was better off with my tried and trusted Cruisers.NEVER HAD SUCH A BAD CASE OF LEAKS WITH CRUISERS .......WILL NEVER USE BABY DRY DIAPERS AGAIN.I hope Pampers is not dropping its quality :(</review>

<review id="5908">I bought this hard drive in November 2008 but didn't actually take it out of the box until late December.  Less than a week after unboxing it, I turned it on only to have it start spinning uselessly.  My computer wouldn't recognize it as anything but a malfunctioning USB device and following the troubleshooting steps on the Iomega website got me nowhere.  Support is annoying at best; I dislike using online chats for support (the only free option) and phone calls run $25 per incident.  Email isn't available at all.  It's ridiculous.  It's particularly frustrating as the data on the hard drive is now lost to me, some of which can't be replaced, even if the hard drive is.This is my first experience with an external hard drive.  I only wish it had been a better one.  As it stands now, I can't recommend this drive to anyone, especially as other reviews indicate that I'm not the only one with this problem.  Look elsewhere for reliability.</review>

<review id="5910">I am absolutely baffled that this product has so many positive reviews. I purchased this router about 2 years ago for my first apartment and since my mom has the same one, I assumed all the issues I was having were coming from the Motorola Surfboard modem. A friend came by after 2 months of my resetting and rebooting both and finally did some magic that made it more stable. I moved and had no use for it after that but kept it. Now, I've got my own house and had my cable/DSL set up Saturday about 2. By 2:30, I had the setup wizard frozen and was on the phone with India/Sri Lanka/ Philippines/Bangladesh or some other far off foreign country speaking with tech support. It was a challenge to follow the girl's directions since her accent was so thick I couldn't make out half of them! After she suggested I 'kindly' update my firmware, my set up wizard crashed and I couldn't access half of the router's website anymore! After 45 minutes of phone talk I finally just said it was working fine and it did for about 15 minutes. Then I had to run set up wizard again since when I tried to reset the router, it killed the WPA encryption I had set up and I had to rename the router and recreate the security. Not that bad... until you have to do it every quarter of an hour. LITERALLY! So this morning after spending another 45 minutes on the phone with the Philippines and having the new girl tell me that my CELL PHONE was the reason it wasn't working, and that I should really not have a cordless phone (including cell phones) in the same house as my router (Uhmmmmmmmmmmmmm... excuse me!!!!!!!!?????!!!!!), I decided that maybe it was time to try a new one.I now have a Linksys WRT54G paperweight. And a new, wonderfully reliable (so far, no disconnects in 3 hours...) Belkin F5D8233-4 N Wireless Router Belkin F5D8233-4 N Wireless Router that took longer to drive 6 miles roundtrip to buy than to set up. If you are looking for a new router, PLEASE do not buy this Linksys. It seems to be hit or miss. And unless you are GREAT at computer programming and such, you WILL call tech support and tho, to their credit, they will try to help, it's the same useless information that gets you a quick fix. And when I say quick, I mean the fix will last for about 30 minutes TOPS. Do yourself a favor and buy the Belkin. And no, I don't work for Belkin, and other than my iPod Nano armband, this is my first Belkin product. It will not be my last now.</review>

<review id="5911">i bought this to consolidate several smaller drives i have lying about onto one master backup, and i had serious trouble with the drive.  transferring large folders or files would cause it to have "unknown errors" (of course, after nearly an hour of sitting there) every time, so i was reduced to moving things one at a time.  then, a large file that couldn't be broken up jammed the thing and i gave up.  thinking that somehow it could be my computer, i brought the drive in to my office, but experienced the same issues there.  for the record, the same files were easily transferred to and from 2 other drives i had--simply not this one.it's lovely to look at, and small, but unfortunately ill-designed for what i would imagine to be it's primary purpose--moving large amounts of data for backup!</review>

<review id="5912">Season 2.5 ended on such a great cliffhanger. That's why when you see the first episode of this season, you feal let down. As with most of this season. The good episodes were "Precipice", "Exodus, Part II", "A Measure of Salvation", "The Eye of Jupiter", and "Rapture". But out of 20 episodes that's not good. Even the last episode "Crossraods" was disappointing. Don't get me wrong, it had a great cliffhanger ending, but the episode itself was crap. Unless you bought season 2.5, don't buy this one. It's crap!</review>

<review id="5913">When buying this router, make sure you're aware of which version you're buying.  The v5 version contains new firmware, and cannot be run with third-party firmware like the previous versions.  The firmware in v5 is brand new and awful, as of 1/28/06.  I upgraded my recently purchased v5 router to the latest firmware, and it still was terrible.  Dropped wireless connection every five minutes or less to both B and G adapters.  I'm taking it back and going with the Belkin pre-N router.  Linksys used to be good, but made a horrible mistake with the WRT54G v5.</review>

<review id="5914">I ordered the nose groomer because we had a previous one that worked great, also from Panasonic. Unfortunately, this product didn't work at all!!! I ran out of time to send it back and now am stuck with it and out of $20.00. This is the first bad item I have ever received from Amazon. This product doesn't cut anything and seems to be broken. Will go to a store next time to buy an item like this.</review>

<review id="5915">I've been using this product for about 2 mths now...for a 5 mth old Cavachon.  I don't see any real change in her eyes as yet.

If not, I will not reorder.</review>

<review id="5916">I never really write reviews, but I  was so disappointed with this book, I felt the need to share.  I really enjoyed the first three books, but this book was contrived and simplistic since the first few pages.  It sent a very poor message to teenagers about life.  Everything was wrapped up so neatly and perfectly that it felt like a fanfiction.  I found myself constantly rolling my eyes as every little thing worked out so well.  I also don't like that Bella is so needy that she can't have a personality for herself...she is Edward's shadow.  Overall it was a huge letdown.  It ruined the entire series for me.</review>

<review id="5917">wow I have only had this product for a day and a half. And I am very very impressed with it. The installation of the product(dragon) only took about 10 minutes to install. The voice recognition took about another 10 to fully understand my voice patterns. Actually it started understanding my voice within the first 1 to 2 seconds. I already sent out a ton of e-mails to friends and family. Telling them about this product. All of them are super impressed that for the most part I never even have to touch the keyboard. Most of them have seen my previous e-mails and no that I'm not the greatest typer in the world and misspell words quite a bit. They are impressed of how accurate this software is. For a person like me with a reading disability. This product I would have to say is the best product on the market for people with disabilities. I have dictated this entire review and Dragon has tight every word of it with few mistakes. Occasionally I will have to hit the backspace button and most of the time it is my dictation error that I have to correct. I would recommend this product to anyone that might not have the dexterity to type for long periods of time. Or people with reading disabilities that might not be able to spell very well like myself. This product is awesome. Oh yeah I also read a review before I bought this product that said the man or woman who installed the product on their PC said it had a rocky installation on Vista. I did not run into any problems that they indicated. This product is a dream come true for me.Landon</review>

<review id="5918">This hand mixer has a lot of power, but only one speed...super fast! About the only thing I found it good for was whipping cream - and I had to be really careful or it would splatter everywhere. The food processor part of it is awful, mainly because it only has one speed and beats everything up to mush. The image they show of the product with large pieces of veggies in it have been cut with a knife and placed in the container, it does not cut anything in large pieces. I stupidly tried to mash potatoes in this and they came out the consistency of glue (as did every other vegetable I tried). I do not recommend.</review>

<review id="5919">Got my WRT54G v7 a month ago to replace an older model. Been having nothing but trouble since, with my connection dropping as many as ten times a day for no apparent reasons, and I have to physically reset the router because of DNS problems. Firmware is up to date and the router's properly configured. C'mon, my PC is just about six meters from the router!A lot of people are having the same problem, apparently, and now I really wish I had bothered reading up some reviews before investing in this piece of junk. Shucks, it hardly looks great even as an expensive paperweight....</review>

<review id="5920">First of all, reading 'Eclipse' is like reading two books.  The first book you read is horrible, and the second book you read is quite entertaining.  If you have the fortitude to finish the first half, then, hopefully, with some luck, you will find the ending much better.*SPOILER WARNING*The book starts off much the same as the ending of New Moon, which is to say, not too bad situation wise, but the added scenes add nothing to the overall story.  Then we are sharply, and unapologetically force fed the backstory of the werewolves.  Perhaps Stephanie thought that one way to add some 'horror' to her series about horror story monsters was to horrify us with her terrible grasp of fantasy writing.  It was one of the dumbest series of stories I have ever read.  The starting premise was how 'spirit warriors' could 'scare away' an entire much larger enemy tribe by making the wind howl, sending 'dogs' to attack, and sending an 'infestation of bats.'  I suppose trying to remove the bats who 'infested' their homes was just too much hassle, and they decided it wasn't worth it to stay.  And surely, those dogs would have been difficult for their skilled warriors to manage.  Oh, and scary too.  Imagine, dogs barking at them!  Howling winds!  Too scary!  I wanted to close my eyes and stop reading at the horror!The next equally blatant back story force fed to us was that of Rosalie.  Remember Rosalie, the one who hated Bella, and then started liking her somewhat inexplicably?  Her story screamed with unrealism and predictability.Next came Jasper, and this story grated my last nerve.  It suspiciously looked like it had been a 'cut and paste' hack job from what had been originally intended as a flashback story from Jasper's perspective.  It's only a theory, but it's well supported.  No one ever remembers their history and recites it like they are reading a book.  I mean, you don't say things like 'I won't do it,' Emily said, her face a immutable block of ice, when you are talking to someone, now do you?  You wont find that line in the book, but this is typical of some sentences Jasper recites when describing his history.  Kinda ruins the 'immersion' factor, now doesn't it?Well, Jasper's story, outside of being written totally inappropriately was actually very uninteresting.  Pointless, and droning.  A pathetic effort.While these backstories were being told, some werewolf-vampire tension was being built around the Jacob-Bella-Edward love triangle.  This would be more effective if Jacob really had a chance, but Stephanie has always insisted on killing this possibility clearly and repeatedly in her books.  The rest of the book of the book focuses on stringing previously discovered 'seemingly unrelated events' together through Bella's brilliant intuition.  The problem was that the events seemed related from the start.  Then, somehow, magically, the building werewolf-vampire tension was turned to werewolf-vampire teamwork verses a silly, totally ineffectual vampire threat.To accomplish this, the Jacob-Edward tension eases as Edward learns to trust Bella.  When the 'great threat' is  discovered by Bella (giving her some small purpose) the Jacob-Edward-Bella can be a united front against this great evil.  Stephanie added quite a bit of spice to the mix here as Jacob takes a sleazy opportunity to antagonize his rival Edward, and then Edward takes his equal opportunity to antagonize his rival Jacob.  Bella, who is constantly whining about not wanting her loved ones to die for her already now whines about how she is an instrument of torture to the two boys she loves.   This whining might have had some merit if Stephanie didn't have Edward douse it with total acceptance.So, if you can get through the whining, there is some very intriguing story here.Throughout the book, Stephanie fills the minds of her readers with as many near sex scenes as possible to heighten the 'tension' while occasionally throwing in Edward's 'M' word requirement to add to the psychological drama.  Bella's internal struggle (the only kind of struggle she is allowed to have) with marriage is something a bit weird, as is Edward's struggle with sex.  Edward's morality is based around trying to keep from committing the one sin that he hasn't already broken.  Bella's issue has more to do with the fact that she  says 'ew' every time she thinks about marriage.  I mean, she is brave enough to 'die' to be with the one she loves, but isn't bold enough to run away and get married.  Bella is quite the paradox, and in too many ways to be a well loved protagonist.Well, guess what?  The silly ineffectual vampires really were no threat at all, except in very mildly harming Bella's werewolf boyfriend that she never really loved as much as her vampire boyfriend. I mean, the vampire who hurt Jacob must have worked hard to hurt Jacob, but not kill him.  In fact, he injured two werewolves, put them out of commission and made them unable to fight, yet did not kill them.  I guess he didn't really want to kill them after all.  Maybe the whole war was just a misunderstanding that went out of control.  We will never know, because those werewolves or Cullens must have eventually killed him. Poor guy.Oh, and another fascinating tidbit of vampire lore.  'Newborns' are massively strong for a year or so, but they have no tactics, which basically nullifies them as a threat.  Good to know if you are you are concerned that a main character might actually die.This is a bad book.  Not that there is no entertainment value in it.  I enjoy the he-she-he struggle, which is at times almost believable.  Stephanie feels compelled to completely suffocate the interesting parts of the story, and tease us with dead ends that go nowhere.  It is almost like she is scared to write a good book.  Of course,  the biggest weakness of this book lies in the weakness of the main character, who is neither brave nor noble nor virtuous.  She is simply Bella, some girl who is in love.  Entirely forgettable.</review>

<review id="5921">I just got this item (Norelco's on-line ad suggests that they understand very well what men are looking for), but they got it wrong somewhere along the line.

<review id="5925">This might work on some animals, but not mine.  I'm just glad I didn't pay $100 like someone else who reviewed the product, but got it for $25.  Still a complete waste of my money.  I have dogs with a double coat of thick hair.  The fine teeth on the furminator does not go past the top coat.  My rake takes off much, much more hair than this tool does.  If you have a short haired dog, or one that doesn't have an inch deep of fur on him, this might work for you.  For the really hairy dogs, though, do yourself a favor and stick to your rake.</review>

<review id="5931">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      I began this series after hearing of its popularity. After reading "Twilight," I was not impressed but decided I would give the rest of the books a try because I was interested in seeing what happened to the characters (and seeing if the books improved over time). However, instead of becoming more likable, Bella managed to become even more annoying. Though I found this book very engaging, Bella's repetitive, whiny thoughts did not make her a very strong heroine. Also, this book, like the first one, lacked much of a plot. Though the events at the end of the book were interesting, it would have been much better if they were brought in throughout the 600 pages. That way, action and anticipation could build throughout the story instead of just occurring at the end. The werewolf story, which I enjoyed, was also extremely transparent and it was very annoying to see that Bella was unable to catch on to what was happening. As an end note, I love Jacob so I have trouble rooting for Edward and Bella. Despite the problems I find in these books, it's likely that I'll end up reading the rest because, in the end, they keep my interest enough to be curious as to what will happen to Bella and who she will end up with.</review>

<review id="5932">I just got a new Linksys WRT54G wireless router and the outraging fact I just discovered is that several versions ago Cisco/Linksys crippled this device by downsizing its Flash and RAM memory to one half of the original amounts and redesigned its hardware and firmware, so this is actually an entirely different device, and that's why you will see so many different user ratings. The older versions of this wireless router are amazing and extremely flexible pieces of hardware.  If the original version of the router was so good that it was competing with their far more expensive wireless routers, they should have discontinued this model and started a new version.  Instead, they decided to fool us by cutting the size of Flash and RAM memory and entirely redesigning the inside of this model and moreover, they started a new more expensive version from the original (WRT54GL).  Shame on Cisco management - they should be sent back to Ethics 101.</review>

<review id="5934">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Full-Screen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      This film is only for those who "must see" all of the Christian Bale Batman series, and have been suckered in by the hype.  Unlike his Batman; The Beginning, where Christian was allowed to act as well as perform action, Dark Knight only requires action scenes.  The rest of the time he stands around befuddled, delivering dialog that makes you want to run your cat's claws across a black board.  And Heath?  Oscar nomination?  Please, everyone calm down and get a grip.  Every Joker scene is repetitive -- there is no depth of acting -- he does the exact same slobbering delivery in each scene.  At most, his Joker characterization is annoying.  To say the least, it is boring.And the action scenes?  Predictable.  Say what you will about the Mission Impossible series, but their actions scenes always carried an element of excitement and surprise.  The Dark Knight actions scenes are routine, and carry an element of looking at your watch and yawning.  Proof:  The two ferry boats scene.  Did you care in the least which boat blew-up?  Were you on the edge of you seat as the explosive clock ticked down?  Now go back and look at the ferry boat scene in War of the Worlds.Watch Dark Knight if the rental price is right, or a friend has it.  Just so you can say you saw it.</review>

<review id="5935">This review is from: Twilight (Ultimate Collector's Set) (Amazon.com Exclusive) [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)      Fangs. A set of long, sharp ones is almost invariably the first characteristic that comes to mind when we think of vampires -- that and the fact, of course, that they bite. So, it is understandable that a viewer would think similar thoughts when watching "Twilight," a film about those famous blood-suckers. Yet, it turns out that neither the main vampire nor any of the others in this film has those trademark fangs, nor does he really bite. Worse still, the movie itself, in which he is the center of attention, has no metaphorical fangs either, much less anything close to a bite.The picture, a strictly-by-the-book adaptation from Stephenie Meyer's bestselling novel of the same name, is perhaps what it might be like to watch an episode of the television series True Blood tragically reincarnated as a torpid afterschool special. (To be sure, that's by no means a criticism of True Blood, which is tremendously enjoyable first-rate TV.) I have not read any of the original stories myself but, to judge from their wild success and the palpable anticipation of this movie, they must have struck the legions of their captivated fans with heavy doses of suspense, fear, horror, lust, intrigue... You know, the same feelings any vampire tale worth its fangs would evoke. The same ones that, here, are largely missing except for the very briefest of moments.The plot concerns teenage Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) who has just moved from Phoenix to Forks, Washington, a small town perpetually cloaked in clouds of gray. She doesn't fit with her other classmates in her high school at first --driving that big pickup truck of hers doesn't help -- though she soon falls in with a group who soon become her friends. Among other activities, like surfing (under those perpetually gray skies), they enjoy making fun of a particular clan students. Perhaps the clan is such an easy target because of their pale skin. Maybe it's their eccentricity or the fact that they are extremely insular, never traveling or socializing outside their own group. Or, more likely, it could be the fact they're far and away the best-looking, kids in town (and the sexiest, judging from the screams, moans, and whoops of the teenage girls in the theater at the showing I attended).So, it comes as a surprise to Bella that her assigned seat in science class -- of course it would be science class -- is right next to the one of the clan, Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), with whom she soon finds herself not only observing class projects together but gradually falling in love, though she doesn't realize at first that he is a 100-year-old vampire. It seems to take her another century to finally learn that fact, and the revelation comes only after Edward answers her questions, responding only after long being evasive about his speed, strength, and really cold skin. A fairly predictable course follows: mutual infatuation; surprised, envious classmates; concerned parents; exotic revelations (Edward never sleeps, but enjoys secretly watching Bella doze; in sunlight, his skin sparkles as if he spent the day rolling in a pool of party glitter); Bella's awkward first meeting with the rest the Cullen clan; breathtaking seduction; and a fight with evil vampires while Bella is in peril. Again, most of this feels too familiar and as if its' been done much better in many other places.The film's most imaginative and genuinely enchanting scene is a baseball game Bella plays with Edward and the Cullens in a clearing in the woods, under a thunderous, lightning-filled sky, the ball -- and the ball players -- moving at surreal speeds. Another spurt of imagination comes when Edward gives Bella a tour of his home, not a dilapidated old mansion from the 19th century, but an impeccable, ultramodern architectural extravagance, with walls of glass, high in the wooded hills.By the time we've started into the final thirty minutes of the two-hour-long endeavor, the movie has long lost the viewer's interest. I doubt, however,  that this film could be saved by merely trimming the running time (or adding a few fangs). There are too many other issues with it. The tone of the film is funnier and more ridiculous than apparently intended due in no small measure to the stilted script by Melissa Rosenberg, Catherine Hardwicke's misguided direction and, most of all, the wooden, emotionless acting of everyone in front of the camera, including all the pretty boys and girls. The special effects are average, less than the exhilerating experience they're meant to be. Earlier in the film, infatuated stares between Bella and Edward occur so frequently and last so long they become more comical than engrossing.Ultimately, the film may be of some mild, passing interest to fans of the novel  but almost certainly not to most others who are unfamiliar with it. It seems existing fans, too, would be let down by this bland reincarnation which, if it truly is as faithful to the book as it is reputed to be, sheds a light on that book that is unflattering indeed. Despite the natural assumption that it would be difficult for a film of this subgenre to achieve such a dubious distinction, this one does: it's a true bore.</review>

<review id="5936">DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  As a new Mac user I was looking forward to moving my Quicken data from windows to mac.  As a Quicken user of many years I thought the move would be easy.  This program is awful. It is not at all intuitive.  The sorting doesn't work.  The data had to be saved in a new format within windows before exporting to mac vs converting it upon installation.  I think I'm going to use the windows partition (in Parallels) and use the windows version.  This program is less than useless.</review>

<review id="5937">I bought my BG2030 after reading several positive reviews on the product.  I charged it overnight, and used it to trim some parts and shave others--being generally satisfied. As many previous reviews stated, the shave was not really close, but the trimmer worked fairly well.  I would like the attachment to allow slightly longer trimming, if I had my druthers.  Two days later, I decided to use it again.  However, it would not stay on.  I would have to depress the on switch several times before it wouldgo on, and then it would automatically go off after 5-20 seconds. This pattern repeated continually.  I fully recharged it (overnight), and upon trying it, it worked perfectly.  Two days later, the same internittent operation problem.  At no time did the "low battery" light show--and it shouldn't have, since I had only used it about 20 minutes.  I left it alone three more days--and it was completely dead.  So,I must have a lemon--it would not hold a charge for more than a few days--and when partially discharged, would not operate properly.</review>

<review id="5938">Very similar to the Harry Potter phenomenon, The Shack has taken the book publishing world by storm. First printed at Kinkos just a few years ago, The Shack has been located at the top of the publishing charts for months, often rated in the Top 10 for Amazon.com.  What is it that makes this story so compelling? I believe bringing the three Persons of the Godhead to an almost-human level intrigues many readers. How many times have we said, "If only I could just see God face-to-face, just like Moses, wouldn't that be awesome?" Yes, of course, but that just never happens. Or not until we read The Shack, which is based on a tragedy and helps us understand, perhaps in a metaphorical sense, how God feels when we go through the tough times.I believe there are three positives that can be taken from this book. First of all, The Shack shows us that God desires a relationship with His people because He loves us. God doesn't just want His people to be followers of a bunch of rules of some man-made religion. He also doesn't want us to come into this relationship as a result of force, like some type of divine rape. Second, Young does a good job explaining evil, that it is not something that is created but is rather the absence of good. Finally, the book helps explain why true forgiveness does not hold on to the past. When the main protagonist (Mack) is confronted with having to forgive his daughter's killer, he realizes that the hatred he had in his heart for the serial murderer was actually detrimental to his own sanity. Forgiveness frees the forgiver instead of allowing the person to be tortured with lingering hatred.Despite these three points, I cannot recommend The Shack for four reasons:1. It presents a low view of scripture. According to the worldview portrayed by the author, the importance of studying God's Word to find out His will for us today is deemphasized. Rather, he encourages personal revelation. Mormonism does the same thing: Just pray about whether or not the Book of Mormon is true, and God will make it manifest by a peace and comfort in our soul. But does it really work like that? Actually, God's written Word is the only trustworthy source for revelation to humankind. It alone teaches everything that is necessary for salvation and is the standard for us to know Truth. Over and over again, the Bible testifies to its own uniqueness and sufficiency (i.e. 2 Tim. 3:16; Ps. 19:7; 2 Tim. 2:15).2. It presents a low view of God. This takes place in several ways. One, it moves God to a human level. Of course, the story is fictional, so there are certain leeways that the reader must concede. But when Papa (God the Father) is likened to a heavyset black woman who says "Sho' Nuff" and displays other stereotypical traits, when "She" is listening to "funk" and seems to relate with the things that some of "Her" "kids" are "showin' and spoutin' off," when Mack continually uses a number of four-letter words in the presence of the all-holy and almighty God, then I think we've lowered the essence of the very being of God that is too close to blasphemy, at least from my apologetic perspective.  In addition, Young's modalistic view of the Trinity (Papa has scars in His wrists but Jesus doesn't?) is skewed. Young portrays the Father as being Jesus as being the Holy Spirit. But this is a distortion of the Holy Trinity and could be very confusing for the average Christian. In fact, let's be honest. How well can most readers recognize this very ancient heresy? If you read the hundreds of reviews on Amazon where the testimonials abound explaining how this book has revolutionized their view of God, then I believe Young does an incredible disservice to the Christian community.3. It presents a low view of the local church. According to the picture that is painted, the local church is nothing more than a "religion and institution" that has become irrelevant to the 21st century. If you were to believe Young, it seems almost better to go it alone, just Papa and me. But the Bible clearly teaches that we are not to "give up meeting together" (Heb. 10:25) with other believers. Just like the disciples did in Acts 2:42, Christians should be devoted to each other. I believe the local church can still be relevant today, so the proverbial baby does not have to be thrown out with the bathwater.4. It presents a low view of salvation. While Young is not necessarily a Pluralist (meaning, all religions are true), he utilizes some statements throughout that make it appear this is so. On page 192, Papa says that "through (Jesus') death and resurrection, I am now fully reconciled to the world." The book says that He loves everyone equally the same. Young also says that there is no punishment for sin; rather, "sin is its own punishment, devouring you from the inside." While God is certainly a loving and merciful God, He is also a God of justice. This aspect is entirely lost by Young in his distorted portrayal of salvation.With these four points taken into consideration, I just cannot recommend The Shack. While this book was certainly written as fiction, it introduces confusion with its theological inconsistency and may cause the sincere reader to accept wrong views of important issues related to Christianity, which is why I am very concerned. With so much good Christian fiction (or just good Christian books that develop one's relationship with God, e.g. Tozer, Lewis, and many others)--I'm not sure why we should want to go dancing with a stranger.</review>

<review id="5939">The aiptek camcorder I purchased has several flaws of which two are fatal: for starters the ccd has very low sensitivity so unless you are outside on a bright sunny day and tape slow motion events the picture is dark, reddish and in general of very low quality. The second serious problem is that the size of the files produced do not get even close to what the advertisements describe. There is no way to fit more than a few minutes into the internal memory and the external card is of limited help. Finally when I contacted aiptek about the second problem they did not even bother to respond.</review>

<review id="5940">I've used Norelco razors since I was 15, 48 years ago, but my next razor won't be a Norelco.  I replaced my old razor with a newer model last Spring (the 8140XL).  In the past, I would replace the heads every few years, but with this razor after 6 months the heads needed replacing. I've now used the replacement heads for 3 months and they have already grown dull!  It's obvious that Norelco has succumbed to the idea that their profits are really in selling the heads rather than the quality items they used to sell.  Buy something else.</review>

<review id="5941">This was bought for me as a birthday present and I was delighted to open the box today on what looked like a well presented and easy to use product. However, it does not work! The display is stuck in the 'set time and date' mode and will not budge at all. Removing and reinserting the batteries makes no difference. We are returning to Amazon to get a replacement on the assumption mine was a lemon, so hopefully I'll be able to give this more stars if I ever get a working one. I remain skeptical though, as it appears from other reviews that the technical QC on this product is dreadful. It looks like more care has been spent on the packaging than on developing a consistent product. To paraphrase what others have said: "An excellent idea, dreadfully executed"Overall, very disappointing.</review>

<review id="5942">This brush is very effective in removing dog hair. However, you MUST be very careful when using it to not cut or irritate the dog's skin. It also states this in the instructions for usage. I purchased it for my golden retriever and had to return it after just one use. She wound up with irritated skin and cuts in certain areas. If you are not a professional groomer you must be very careful when using it. At a hefty price of $40/$45 dollars a brush please consider this before using the brush. I returned it to amazon and was advised by my vetenarian to stop use immediately. Because certain dogs have sensitive skin, it should be considered prior to purchasing it.</review>

<review id="5943">This product is a piece of junk.   It does indeed have a Advanced Position Sensor and an audible indication.   The advanced position indication requires the device to be in the proper position and indicates when it is by beeping.   The beep is so low as to be almost impossible to hear . . . no matter if you have perfect hearing . . . you will not hear the beep.   If the battery is just the slight bit low it fails to work and the battery indicator does not indicate the low level below which the device fails to work.   Forget about using it on your right arm, you can not hear the device when it is in the proper location and you can not see the face of the device when on the right arm.   DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!   YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!</review>

<review id="5947">My Flip arrived today in the mail, and I eagerly popped the included Duracell AAs in and started taping my friends.  Sadly, on the 5th video, which was all of 10 seconds (the others were shorter still) the Flip froze and said that the video was unplayable.  I tried to turn the unit off to restart, but no dice.  I waited a few minutes, still nothing.  So, I had to remove the batteries to get the thing to turn off.  Tried again, same thing, and the rest of the videos were now unplayable as well.  I ended up having to delete that one video to make the rest accessible.  Weird and certainly inconsistent.When I tried to connect to my computer, I was immediately informed that there was a software update, so I installed it on my machine.  Seemed simple enough, but uploading a 6-second video clip to YouTube took well over a minute on a high-speed connection.  Slightly frustrating, but not a huge deal.  Still, I wonder how long a 10-minute video would have taken.Later on, I tested out the TV connection.  It worked once (played one video) and then froze again.  Then, my TV video mode suddenly switched of its own volition.  The Flip beeped at me but wouldn't turn off, or show me any more videos.  I unplugged it, still nothing.  Had to again remove the batteries to turn the thing off.  However, the video that I did see was very clear on our Sony 36" WEGA TV set.Design-wise, the buttons are sticky, and although I have small hands, it's still difficult to hit the Record button just right.  It would stick and record for a split second and then stop again.  Mildly annoying.  The USB arm is a cool flippy thing, but it seems fragile and I was concerned that it would snap off easily.  A USB port would have been a better option, especially since you need to buy a USB cord to connect this to a desktop anyways.After one day and so many problems, this is definitely going back.  I'm really disappointed, because I had such high hopes - it looked like a really cool gadget, and from first glance seemed to be well made.  However, I can't justify spending $150 on something that only works half the time...or less.  I'm hoping for other consumers that this was just a glitch, and that I just happened to get one that is temperamental - especially since I also sent one to some relatives as a gift!</review>

<review id="5948">Like it or not, these are the standards, so you have to have them, right? Over the years I've grown to learn how to navigate the features and foibles of Word and Excel. They were clunky at times, but I learned them and had them working well for me. Now it's radically different. They are harder to personalize, harder to use, and I have to learn them all over again. I've been using Word and Excel '07 for about a year now, and they are still frustrating. What I liked about the '03 versions was that I chose the icons for the commands I wanted and then had menus that I was familiar with to drop down and use. Now the icons are teeny tiny and I have to go searching for stuff that I only use once in awhile. If the ribbons were customizable, they might be handy -- but they're not. I find them counterintuitive -- especially when I'm looking for something that I used to know how to find instantly. Hmmmm... where did they put that thing? Yes it's a reasonable price for such potentially powerful software. Yes I understand you can put it on 3 computers. OK, I will figure out how to make it feel fluid again eventually. Do i have a choice? I will obey. I will be absorbed. Grrrrrrrr........</review>

<review id="5950">I just got the Lacie 1TB drive and started backing up some of my files to it. I first tried connecting it via the eSata interface and after a few hiccups (I'm using Vista), the drive's initial partition showed up with a start.exe file on it. When you run this file, it performs a quick format of the drive and you are set to go. I left my machine copying a few gigabytes and went for dinner. When I came back the files were copied but the drive was no longer showing up. So much for the eSata interface. I then connected it using Firewire. This connection is fine so far, except that it is really slow. If you copy a large file (a few hundred MB) throughput will start high (60MB/sec which is nonsense for Firewire) and quickly go down to about 7MB/sec which is really slow. I haven't tried the USB connection yet believing it to probably be the slowest.The drive itself is really beautiful. Noise emission is average to slightly loud.</review>

<review id="5951">Intuit has decided years ago that their customers are so enamored of the name that they will buy anything at any price.

Each year they have charged more and done less in each of their versions.

<review id="5952">This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) (DVD)      As a fan of Transformers going back to 1984, I was highly disappointed with this movie. The only good thing about it was the quality of the CGI used to render the robots, despite the poor designs of said robots. The plot was a typical action movie plot, with no development. Most of the robots, who were little more than guest stars in their own movie, got no character development. On top of that, you have a story that treated the franchise, which has been successful for 20+ years, with little to no respect. All in all, this movie was not even close to what I was hoping for, but it was everything I was expecting and less. This was the wrong team for this movie, and the movie shows it. If you have an IQ, avoid this movie.</review>

<review id="5956">I purchased this netbook with high expectations.  Unfortunately it did not pan out.

<review id="5957">For measuring weight this scale is fine.

<review id="5959">The Law of Attraction. Like attracts Like, at least in this producer's head. In the rest of the REAL physical universe, opposites attract. If you REALly want to know how the laws of attraction work it's no "secret", just take a look at a battery. One end has a "+" symbol on it. The other end has a "-" symbol on it and the ONLY reason it supplies electrical current is because opposites attract.The only reason any of us are here is because our two parents, who were the "opposite" sex, were "attracted" to each other. There is nothing "metaphysical" about the secret. It's a waste of $30. I'm ashamed to admit that I got caught up in the hype after Oprah peddled it twice on her show.</review>

<review id="5960">I found the series to be run of the mill and Weaver's horrible narration makes it inconceivable to re-watch.  Attenborough's solo work, especially his 'bird series' is far superior, he can capture an audience with his voice alone, Weaver never found the right voice for these "all too in love with themselves" images.  I don't care how long it took to get the penguin or snow leopard sequences...a major disappointment on all levels.  "Nature" still stands as the leader in the natural world documentary sweepstakes, head and shoulders above this failed effort.</review>

<review id="5961">This is the most solidly built bread machine I have ever encountered, looked like it would last for years and years. Unfortunately, the bread it produced was of poor quality.

I tried all sorts of recipes, both those included with the machine as well as some of my tried and true ones, nothing I tried gave me bread my kids would eat. Crust quality and texture were consistently poor.</review>

<review id="5962">Okay, I bought this less than a year ago to back up my mp3's. I have it sitting on the floor, plenty of space around it, not too hot, and I hardly ever even TOUCH it, let alone move it, and it's never been dropped or anything like that. I accessed the files on it maybe a dozen times per month, it was mostly used for back up of old files.Sooooo.... Suddenly, out of the blue, the other day when I went to add some files to it, (still had like 50 gigs of space open on it), it was not accessible. When I checked on Computer Management it said FILE SYSTEM BLANK. Yeah, that's right, blank. The file system is shot, all files are just GONE along with the NTFS file SYSTEM. In other words, in case you need to have it spelled out for you, this piece of s just effin DIED for no reason.Even if it's still under warranty (I have not checked yet but I'm almost positive it is not), what good is a warranty when all my files are GONE?As to what to buy instead, I do not know. Have no idea. I bought 3 Seagates. Two of them are still going after about 2 years, but one of them died just around 1 year, just like this one.My feeling is that ALL external drives are s--t.Guess I'll try an Apple TV next. Apple seems to be able to make good storage. You don't hear too much about 80-160 gig IPods dying. Or do you?In any case, my next drive will not be a WD nor a Seagate.</review>

<review id="5964">I too went to see this film because of the free tickets received with our classic Bond blu-rays. Thank the lord the tickets were free otherwise we would have demanded our money back. Nothing against Daniel Craig, he is a talented actor in some areas, but not as Bond. As one of the other reviews stated he is the most un-Fleming like Bond. Which makes him good, how? Bond should be Bond and in this movie he is a low level Jason Bourne action movie ripoff. But that is not the problem with the movie. The problem with Quantum of Solace surprisingly isn't the title and isn't the non Bond worthy star, it is the director and the guys from the Bourne movies that were hired to film it.The action scenes are a confusing mess. A really bad mess, there are times it is hard to tell who is doing what to whom, and even better yet WHY.To that point the plot makes little to no sense at all. Beyond the brooding, charmless Bond going after revenge for his suicided girlfriend.  (a foot note: she killed herself,it is nothing like when Blofeld murdered Bond's wife.)Holding a bankrupt 3rd world nation ransom is a good move. That is what Blofeld and SPECTRE would do right? Oh. That's right he wouldn't.. Why would anyone try to pass this plot off to the movie going public is the biggest mystery surrounding Quantum of Soalce.As it turns out the biggest insult was yet to come, the extras included in this Blu-ray are almost non existent. Where is the alternate ending the director talked about? Where are the cut scenes? Could there possibly be a directors cut of this film that has makes sense of the movie.No. Not on this edition which is ashame. If you (are among the few who) saw Quantum of Solace and liked it you should pick it up on Blu-ray, it will never look or sound better. If you thought it was Okay then wait for the inevitable second release which will contain the extras which will make it worth while.As for me I'm skipping this one and ordering the next wave of Classic Bond Blu-rays and if I want to see Daniel Craig in halfway decent movie I'll watch Casino Royale, on Blu-ray of course.</review>

<review id="5966">I have owned and used 4 pairs of these pieces of shit.  They always break, I don't know what I am doing wrong, but the mic on them always gives out after a period of time of probably 1-3 months.  I have taken the headsets back and returned them for another pair thinking it was just a defect, but then again another 2 months and they break.  The people who are giving good reviews probably don't use them for talking on ventrilo, or teamspeak, and might not know how horrible of quality they are, since only when you use them for communication do you realize they don't work after a while.Anyone who is considering these headsets don't buy them for gaming.

<review id="5967">I've had this toothbrush for a few years, and it has a consistent problem with mold growing in the head piece (they call it a nut).  I was told this was a common issue, and they offered to replace the toothbrush, even though it was out of warranty, and then spent three days trying to get out of having to live up to that offer.In short, the toothbrush is basically unusable, unless you like brushing your teeth with a molding, reeking toothbrush head.  There's a reason why they now sell a super championship ultraviolet cleaner for $50.  Philips customer service is just about as good.  My wife has an Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400, and it works like a charm.  No mold issues there, and it's a rotary brush just like the dentist uses.  I'd recommend avoiding the Sonicare like the plague, unless that's exactly what you want to get.</review>

<review id="5969">After reading several of the reviews for this maker, I thought "must be great".  I bought it.  The first pot, I used cold filtered water from the fridge.  The pot took 9 minutes and 37 seconds to brew.

The pot brewed at just over seven minutes.I love the design, I love the toggle switch in the front for the on/off.  I love the knobs (cheap though) the whole thing feels cheap except for the caraffe.  I think it's an "inexpesive to build but make it expensive so people think they're getting an awesome coffee maker" type of situation.  Either way, the heating element is way too small.</review>

<review id="5973">I purchased this for my mother who must check her blood pressure often. This is not an accurate measuring tool. I returned it immediately for a refund.</review>

<review id="5974">I have always loved the series, believe me. But this last book was completely out of sync with the previous three. At first, I thought this saga was splendid, as it explored questions like fate and destiny and true love and the sacrifices you have to make in a relationship. Or a relationship that went so deep even when you couldn't touch the other person. A relationship that was solely about the mind and about the soul and about ACCEPTANCE.These messages haven't been destroyed by Breaking Dawn-- no, it's pretty obvious that Bella and Edward love each other, yadda yadda. That fact had been established long ago.The things that really disappointed me were that: usually YA books can be appropriate for twelve-year-olds, but the content and suggestive material in it should really make this book an Adult fiction novel (I'm 14 and am ok with the content, but there are a LOT of eight year olds reading this stuff and that's just not right); secondly, Edward tends to push toward the "flat" side of the character spectrum, as he's pretty predictable and either black and white; thirdly, the "happily ever after" seemed so FORCED.Explanations:(There may be spoilers!!!)Okay, my first point just goes without having to explain. I'm fine with suggestive material and the physical relationship bit-- hey, that's how humans, such as Bella, and the human inside Edward, show their love. But it was way. too. much. Twilight is a a hugely popular series, and I hear little innocent girls talking about it and raving about it all the time. It's just that if I were a mother, I wouldn't want my eight-year-old reading something with such salient sexual content, you know? And plus, though Bella IS mature for her age, she is being so reckless with her life. Sure, she's in love, but is that enough reason to go running around, oblivious of the things going on around her? Like her family-- she thought about ELOPING at one point. And her friends. And to be married so young and throw her life away-- she had a choice. Edward even asked her to spend a few years in college before becoming a vampire! Anyways, next point.Okay. Edward. I have been INFATUATED with him for the past two years, but now, he just bores me sometimes. The stuff he says is sweet, but even for me, the avid romantic, it just becomes so prosaic and predictable. In Breaking Dawn, every time Bella asks him, "How do I look?" or any variant of that, he says, "Gorgeous. Of course, you've always been." Awwww, cute. But after at least ten times, it gets annoying. This is just a little point though.And now, the ending. It was to be expected. It felt so forced and unnatural, the way things played out-- Bella went to Rose for advice, Jacob fell in love with Bella's DAUGHTER, the fact that somehow a vampire and a human were able to produce a baby, and the fact that Bella had such an easy time as a young vampire. Hasn't that been the main point though? That young vampires-- and vampires in general-- didn't have much self-control? But somehow, miraculously, she had it. It's cool that destiny was on her side and she was "born to be a vampire", but seriously, It's pushing believability  here. I know that's weird to say about a fantasy novel, chock full of vamps and wolves, but it's true. There's a boiling point. There's a boundary between imagination and far-fetched stuff evoked out of thin air in order to move the plot along.Oh. And another thing that annoyed me. Jacob only loved Bella-- in the romantic way-- because she was destined to have Renesmee. That's just WEIRD. It's an original idea, sure, but presented in the most odd and slightly distasteful manner possible. What, so if Bella wasn't going to have the baby at all, he wouldn't love her? There were so many other ways Stephenie could've done this! And yet, she chose this forced ending. She made new things up in order to drag the plot along, hoping that somehow it'd get her to the ending she vowed she'd write. I can't read her mind, but that is the way it seems. Anyone could've predicted the last lines. Anyone could've predicted that Bella and Edward would end up together. The author promised it would be so, and I'm glad it worked out for the characters, but the way it happened was unnatural and too extreme and too randomly-contrived.This is my opinion, of course, and Breaking Dawn has not ruined my respect for the author, but unlike the previous books, I don't think it's something I'd read over and over again if I had the choice.</review>

<review id="5975">This review is from: Slumdog Millionaire (DVD)      A story of true love triumphing over all odds.  The disappointing part was the superb beauty of the character played by Freida Pinto - it was little difficult to understand the dogged persistence of the young man.  The story would have been so much better had the heroine been played by a dwarf.  Then it would have been more of a story of true love.  She should also have had perhaps a disturbing tick or something like that.</review>

<review id="5976">Cheaply made of unfinished wood. Seems sturdy enough once it's latched, but just because it's made of wood does not mean it is good quality. It is stapled together (no screws, dowels, or glue), flexes in every direction and binds when you try to slide it open or shut. The quick removal feature means the hardware on the hinge side is also sloppy and rattles. We took it down after 2 days and were happy to spend twice as much on a better gate.</review>

<review id="5978">I've been trying to determine what it will cost to purchase TurboTax Home & Business (federal and state) with e-filing.  Whether here at Amazon or on Intuit's website, pricing is impossible to decipher.  For example: I received a TurboTax disc in the mail saying "Free before you buy" -- customers are invited to "try it out" and then, after finishing with their returns, to call a toll-free number to pay for the software.  However, nowhere in the literature does it tell us what the price will be.  On the Intuit website, there's a price for Federal + e-filing ("state returns extra": clicking a link takes you to an ad for the state forms, but price is not listed), Federal and state ("e-filing extra": same deal, price not listed...), and nowhere is there a single, bottom-line price for Federal, State and e-filing.  And I just received an offer from Borders offering "30% off on TurboTax" -- it's difficult to determine whether it's a good deal or not since the base price (on which the 30% discount is based) is different from the base price on the TurboTax website and again, there's no single offer on the website (at least not that I could locate) with a total for federal, state and e-filing.Why the confusion?  I'm going to hazard a guess.  Intuit knows that filling out tax forms is a difficult and stressful project for most of us, and so, rather than list the price for their products in a straightforward way, they've intentionally obfuscated pricing and built in "gotcha" mechanisms that will force most customers, after purchasing the product initially, to pay more than they counted on before they finish the job.Should consumers reward this kind of behavior?  In my opinion, under no circumstances should they do so, regardless of the popularity of the product.  If Intuit succeeds with this kind of a business model, expect other companies to follow suit in the future.I'm not sure how I'll do my taxes this year, but this much is sure: I won't be using TurboTax.</review>

<review id="5979">My daughter bought this for me and I was so excited to use it. We have three dogs, and no matter what, none of them would get acclimated to it.

<review id="5981">This book isn't good for learning anything about relationships.  Steve Harvey has clearly wrote this book to make money.  How will he do that?  By telling females what they want to hear instead of telling them the truth.  This book panders to what women would want men to think about certain topics, this is not the book to read to get you on the road to better relationships. This book doesn't speak about ACCOUNTABILITY at all. When asked about the weight issue he speaks of the shallowness of men instead of telling the women to get in the gym and eat better.  Its funny to me how these men who are always telling these obese females that its fine never have big women on THEIR arms. This book is a make women feel good book. If you want to feel good about yourself and your deficiencies buy it.  If you want to get a better understanding of men and how to keep your relationships on the right track this is not the book.  I wish I could give this book less than one star because this book leads females in the opposite direction of what it takes to be successful.  The best place to start is within, men are visual, and the average woman doesn't display the personality characteristics of the women the men have known to be the epitome of womanhood.Ponder on that.  Thats the secret, not the garbage in this book.</review>

<review id="5984">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      In the first book Bella was dreamless, hobby-less, and hopeless.  Now she becomes a lush for adrenaline because her precious vampire boyfriend dumps her.  One can only wish she'd succeed instead of making the reader suffer along with her for 500 pages.  Bella's self-confidence and self-worth rest on the whims of a boy, and a vampire at that, and that's hardly a good message for any girl to take away from the book.  You get sick of hearing Bella whine about the hole in her chest.The werewolves are actually decent, and one embellished the most also achieves what neither Bella nor Edward can: actual reader interest.  Jacob Black has a hobby!  He has some legitimate angst!  He is flawed!  And he and Bella actually have chemistry that goes beyond "You are my sun, my moon, my stars, my love!"  Jacob strikes me as the kind of guy one could actually LIVE with for the rest of one's existence, morning breath and all.  But don't expect Bella to actually LISTEN to any of this logic.Perhaps more jaded sorts, such as myself, shouldn't read this.  I am not a romance reader; I'm a fantasy buff and a stickler for character logic.  I just kind of ended up in the wrong kind of territory.  It baffles me that shallow, blah characters like Eragon and this series can become bestsellers hand over fist.  I think in order for these books to work for me I'd have to believe in the happily-ever-after for these characters, and all I find myself thinking is "Okay, what are they going to DO for the rest of eternity?  Stroking each other's ego's over how beautiful they are would get really old really fast ..."</review>

<review id="5986">Same old, same old. Likemost modern shows nowadays, GALACTICA seems to feed from the same general rule: a bunchh of characters, when forced to choose between some options, ALWAYS use the worst or stupid one! In that way you create drama!</review>

<review id="5987">I am an older (!) fan who was so excited for this book. Even dragged my husband to a Breaking Dawn party (we were dressed as Edward's parents-- my DH in white tie and tails!) Read the book in one day, with two meal breaks. I laughed, I cried, I yelled at the characters... So many parts were like coming home for what I knew would be the last time. The wedding was perfect, Jacob's visit to the reception both warmed and broke my heart. I thought Stephenie handled the "honeymoon" details masterfully. And yet... as soon as it was obvious Bella was pregnant the whole thing just changed for me. I could still enjoy individual parts (the line about Jacob claiming his birthright was brilliant, I loved the description of Bella's vampire senses), but I had this huge feeling the whole thing was unfair, as if the rules had been changed in the middle of the game. It just didn't feel right. She SAID vampires cannot have babies. I don't care what legalistic mumbo-jumbo there was about "most" fluids, or that she didn't mention men. I felt deceived. Renesmee left me cold. And the showdown with the Volturi was anticlimactic. I agree with whoever said she missed Alice. I *love* Alice. The whole thing with J Jenks was a red herring... I also agree that the character development was somewhat lacking. So, this experience has definitely been bitter sweet for me. Guess I'll start looking into fan fiction to feed my addiction. I read one while ago that, while of course not written nearly as well as SM could do it, had what was to me the perfect ending. Sigh.</review>

<review id="5988">This SanDisk 4 GB Cruzer Titanium is a fine USB drive, and a good value;but that value is heavily offset by the inclusion of the junk 'U3' software that comes pre-installed on the drive and cannot be removed by normal means. Every time you install this drive it puts an application on your task bar. If you delete the pre-installed junk by dragging it to the trash, it 'magically' (and annoyingly) re-appears, and runs, when you re-install the thumb drive. Total Crap! You have to download an uninstaller from the U3 website to get this crap off the drive (I assume by reformatting). Who knows what the installer really does? Who knows what's on there that the 'uninstaller' doesn't really remove?Seems like a decent enough drive otherwise, but why buy from a company that insults and assaults you with junk software you don't want?</review>

<review id="5991">I own a Panasonic digital camera which I enjoy very much. it takes great pictures and it beats Nikon, Sony and Canon in many aspects. Despite my satisfaction with the camera, I did not think of Panasonic when I was on the market for a high defiction camcorder. So I came across the SD9 and was surprised by the low price as by reading the specifications: 3CCD, full HD at 1080p, 24p film mode, it appears to be a very high quality camcorder. But after two weeks of use, I am completely disappointed. The video quality is OK when in very bright condition(day time outdoor). Other than that, video is very noisy with color way off. In my opinion, it can not even compare to a $300 regular camcorder.  I wanted to give it one star but considering that it is very compact, light and is generally easy to handle, I give it two stars.</review>

<review id="5993">I have been a loyal Apple customer (and I still am) going back to 1980, I have become accustomed to Apple making superior products, with a few exceptions (the round mouse and iMovie 08)  I've always been well pleased.The aluminum Macbook is a non-starter due to no Firewire.  Removing Firewire is like taking all the Philips screwdrivers out of a toolbox.Thousands of devices use Firewire, with more coming out all the time. FireWire advantages over USB include:Target Disk Mode on MacsFireWire can be daisy chainedBus Power - FW - Up to 30V/45W vs USB 5V/500mAPeer to Peer Connections (no host or CPU required)Multiple Host on a bus supportTCP/IP Networking supportDistance FW800 = 100 Meters USB = 5 MetersNo Drivers Required (config ROM built in) aka Plug and PlayRemote Control of devices like camerasCableTV Box SupportYou can't transfer a VHS tape or other Video tape using an Analog-to-DV Converter without FirewireThere are no USB to Firewire adapters.The Macbook Pro has Firewire, but many don't want a 15" Macbook Pro, because of the large size. They want something more portable.The aluminum MacBook has no slot for an Express Card.  There's NO WAY to connect any Firewire device to the new MacBooks...period.Keep in mind that when Apple dropped ADB, SCSI and floppy drives in the Mac at least there where alternatives. USB floppy drives and usb to ABD adapters that protected your investment. There is NO option to connect  existing or future Firewire products to the new aluminum Macbook. It will be interesting to see what happens in the first revision of the new MacBooks. The original MacBook Pros didn't have Firewire 800, but Firewire 800 was added in the first revision after many complaints.Firewire is continuing to improve. (Firewire 3200 will be out soon.)  Firewire is more relevant than it ever has been.Most would be better off with the White MacBook (that comes with Firewire). They're slightly faster and cheaper than the low end aluminum Macbook.  The White Macbook is a good machine, good value and a great deal. Apple has always been a visionary company,  leading the way in new technology adoption. this one has me scratching my head. They have removed a mature, ubiquitous and robust protocol and replaced it with... NOTHING!</review>

<review id="5994">The only reason i have purchased this router is because at the time of looking for router my local electronic store had them on sale (> $30.00). For the first couple of weeks it has been working just as it should, after that i had nothing but trouble when using it. It has been dropping connection like every 10-15 minutes making my wife going ballistic (she uses internet for work) I couldn't figure out where the problem is; called local cable company to see if there is problem on their end, have them send technician, then replaced cable modem itself and still the same. It's not a cable provider, it's not a modem...it's this damn router. Many times in the morning i wasn't able to go online using my Desktop (night before it has been working)until i have manually by pulling cables out disconnecting this thing and using modem only....guess what, no problems whatsoever. I'm not sure what I'm going to buy now but i know it won't be another Linksys. It was "only" 30 bucks i consider myself lucky wasting only this much while some others have paid $50 just to find out they have purchased nothing but worthless piece of junk. I would never ever recommend this product unless u want something that will work ( if You're lucky)for some time and then it will simply stop and You won't even be able to return it per 30 days returning policy.</review>

<review id="5995">I have had a couple of George Foreman grills since their inception and was thrilled to hear of their removable plates feature.  I didn't hesitate to spend the money and purchase this grill from a local store.  I don't know what the Salton company is doing differently with this model, but it's my absolute last Foreman grill!Like so many other reviewers, I also noticed a faint odor coming from the grill upon initial uses.  I also dismissed it as normal for a new product.  I don't use the grill very regularly, maybe a couple of times a month or less.  So when the odor continued with each use, I chalked it up to the product still being on the new side, thus still burning off the manufacturer's coating.  Then a couple of weeks ago, I had occasion to use the grill two nights in a row after not having used it for over a month.  During the preheating, the odor was much more pronounced and unmistakably one of burning plastic.  The next evening, the same thing happened.  The burning smell was so intense, it lingered throughout the house till the next day.I called Salton's customer service and explained the problem.  The young lady acted surprised, as though she was hearing this for the first time.  She asked me to turn the grill upside-down to obtain some numbers from the bottom of the unit.  It was then that I observed the plastic bottom of the unit all melted and charred.  I'm still amazed it didn't ruin my countertop!She said they could provide a replacement IF I had the original receipt.  I told her I bought the grill 7 or 8 months ago and didn't want a replacement; I wanted a refund.  She said Salton didn't deal with refunds, only replacements.  I pointed out that the appliance had a one year warranty and was obviously defective, and I didn't want a replacement, I wanted my money back.  She didn't budge and stated that I had to return it to the store for a refund if the store policy so allowed.I wasn't sure if I still had the receipt after all these months, but she told me no replacement would be provided by them unless I had the receipt.  I still don't know why just being a George Foreman grill, and a defective one at that, wouldn't be enough to send back to the company who makes them.  But she said to call back AFTER I found the receipt, and they would arrange a replacement.Luckily, I located the receipt, but I was thoroughly disgusted with the attitude of the company who manufactured a substandard product and then won't even own up to righting their wrongs.  They weren't in the least concerned about customer satisfaction.I decided a trip back to the place of purchase was worth the time.  To my surprise, the store was wonderful and took back the defective grill, no questions asked.  I chose to replace the Foreman grill with the Cuisinart Griddler, and I'm so glad I did!  Up until then, I had nothing to compare Foreman's cooking performance with, so I didn't realize how lousy a cooking job it did until I tried the Griddler.  No matter how long I preheated the Foreman grill, I never got that appetizing sizzling sound when I laid food down on the hot plates.  With the Griddler, I get great searing and browning immediately upon contact with the food.  I also don't notice any wet condensation accumulating around the top of the cover like would happen with the Foreman piece of trash.For those who have Foremans and are happy with them, count your blessings and hope you'll never have to turn to the Salton company with a problem.  I for one am so thrilled that Foreman doesn't have a monopoly on contact grills anymore.  Removable grill plates for easy clean-up are no longer a novelty.  Other companies are doing grills more versatile, multi-functional, and feature-packed than ever.  So do your homework and get the most out of your money.</review>

<review id="5996">Bought this router to replace an old Linksys wireless G adapter and set it up with the identical passwords and permissions and could not utilize file and printer sharing on ANY of my computers after that.  Sometimes couldn't even see the other computers on the network.  Called tech support and they were rude and not very knowledgable beyond basic set-up and told me that it was a windows problem and not a router problem.  Explained SEVERAL times that it had all been set up properly and working on the old router.  Couldn't even ping the other computers on the network.  They finally told me to return it to the store "just to prove to you that it isn't the router." so I did and re-installed my old G router.  Wonder of wonders all of the file and printer sharing miraculously started working again.  Imagine that.  I am going to source another brand of router for my replacement.</review>

<review id="5997">I have an apartment where we connect to this router with a variety of devices: a Mac notebook, a PC notebook with a 802.11g wireless card, and a PC notebook with a 802.11b wireless card. Only the PC with the 802.11g card gets reliable reception, and even then the connection is very slow.I have tried calling customer support a number of times, but each call follows the same plot: I wait over 30 minutes on hold, I explain my problem, I am told to reset the router, I reset the router and the problem returns shortly thereafter. At this point the customer service agent is out of ideas on how to help me, other than having me request a technician (if I request it, I have to pay the $80/hr until the router is fixed).I'm looking at other brands to replace this, as using this router is nearly as bad as trying to poach a connection from across the street.</review>

<review id="5998">When I first got the 3D Pro (October 2005) I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread. It had a lot of buttons (more than I needed) and it had all the features at a price thatw as well within my budget. I recommended it to all my friends and got at least 3 to buy it. About 6 months after he got it, the first of my friends to follow me started having trouble with rudder function and we just thought it was a problem with FS2004. Several attempts to recalibrate the joystick and reinstall FS2004 failed. We were at a loss because it was a brand new joystick. I first noticed my rudder function being compromised about a year after I got it but it was intermittent. I am now at the point (as of around February 2007) that the rudder function is so bad that I just don't fly anymore because the corrections required to keep the aircraft straight ahead are almost full inputs to the right. Yet another friend of mine purchased another Logitech model (I believe it's a Freedom) and less than 2 months after he got it, he is having rudder control problems as well. I have taken a look inside mine and I noticed that the internal mechanism of the twist axis is very frail looking and is of poor design. No wonder there is a problem. Joysticks come under a lot of pressure at times and their internals should reflect resistance to that. Not so here. My advice to potential buyers is to look elsewhere. While I don't expect the 'stick to last forever, there seems to be an inherent fault with this particular model. Good luck.</review>

<review id="5999">I bought the download version of this product directly from Symantec as a license for 3 PCs. I have used Norton for several years now, so did not expect any problems. But here is what I have run into.1. PC-1 - An XP Pro desktop. This is a workhorse machine. Installation was easy. But I noticed that all components of MS Office Pro remain in the memory even after the application is properly exited. These include Outlook, Excel, Word and Access. I have to go to Task Manager to kill the process.Symantec has not been able to give me any answer except to call MSFT. The PC is over 4 years old and so is Office 2003 which came pre-installed. This problem never occurred before I installed Norton 360 v. 2.0. No new programs have been installed except Norton 360.2. PC-2 - A laptop with XP Pro and Office 2003. I use this laptop very infrequently and mostly for web browsing and noticed the same problem as described above. This laptop is over two years old. Again, no additional programs have been installed on this machine except Norton.3. PC-2 - An older (> 4 years) laptop with XP Pro and Office 2003. This laptop is at a remote location and I do not have a good way to find out if the above problem persists. But the virus scan on this laptop has been running for over ten days and not getting completed. In summary, there are issues with this product that Symantec does not want to identify and fix. Their tech support tried to pass the buck to MSFT but when I said that the MSFT applications have been on the machines for far longer and did not have any problems, they today threw the towel and told me to uninstall the product. huh?</review>

<review id="6000">My wife and I have been Quicken users for years. My wife uses this on a shared family machine running XP Home where she is not the Administrator, but one of three users. The program requires installation by the Administrator (fine), but this version of Quicken can only be run and used by the Administrator (not fine). When run in any other user, it does not function correctly. Prior versions of Quicken that we have used did not have this problem. We have the machine set up so that the regular users are not needing to log in as the Administrator to keep those functions safe and somewhat protected. I contacted customer support on two occasions. The first person said that it will only work if you are the Administrator. Not believing that, I tried again and I was told another user could use the program, but there was a need to uninstall and reinstall. They provided what they told me was a workaround, but it did not work. I have not given up yet, and will update this review if I am able to get it working on multiple users.</review>

<review id="6001">I've been considering purchasing Microsoft Office 2008 for Macs, and just weeks ago there were pages of (mostly negative) reviews; now there are only two reviews (the oldest from two days ago...???)

<review id="6002">Whatever the good point of the Magic Bullet (it makes smoothies and grinds coffee beans ALMOST as well as a Cuisinart Food Processor/Blender and costs the same amount of money), they are completely overshadowed by the facts that: 1.) The simplest replacement parts are a HUGE hassle to get. 2.) Homeland Housewares level of customer service is way lower than average.After less than a year's gentle, intermittent use, my Bullet chewed up both of 2 the gaskets it came with. Should be a simple and cheap replacement, right? Wrong! When I frirst contacted Homeland Housewares, the manufacturer, I was told flat out, that because my Bullet wasn't purchased directly from them (it had been a house warming present, purchased at Macy's), I could not buy replacement parts from the manufacturer. AND they could not recommend another source for them. My machine was effectively dead after only 7.5 months of use. Searching the web 5 months later, I saw that the manufacturer was now offering to sell parts to everyone stuck with a non-functional Magic Bullet. But not without a huge hassle. Homeland Housewares demands that its customers, who have already been inconvenienced by the premature break down of its product, now invest the time & effort to send them 4 different photos of the machine AND a photo of the free recipe booklet included with the machine--yes, you heard right--the recipe booklet, BEFORE they will be granted the privilege of spending MORE money with the company to buy replacement gaskets. I explained to Homeland Housewares' phone rep that photos taken with your average digital camera would not reproduce copy from the back of the machine which would be readable. The rep said, "Don't worry about it. Send them anyway." Two days later, I get an email reply from Homeland Housewares saying my photos are inadequate; before they'll allow me to purchase gaskets, they want me to submit a new set of photos. Photos showing WHAT, they neglected to say.My girlfriend spent $83 for this glorified coffee grinder! It worked adequately for 7.5 months, before it chewed its own gaskets to pulp and became a dead weight. Now, I will not be "permitted" to give the manufacturer money for 4 new gaskets, unless my photos meet approval standards I was not informed of before I submitted the first set.After 5.5 years, my Cuisinart Food Processor/Blender continues to make superior smoothies, among myriad other functions it performs beautifully, and Cuisinart has been beautifully responsive to my every question and need. Next time you consider a Magic Bullet as a house warming gift, I recommend the Cuisinart Food Processor/Blender, instead.</review>

<review id="6004">This router might work for some, but BEWARE if you have Vista or even some versions of XP this thing WILL NOT work without extensive configurations and time, I spent 2 hours with customer service trying to get mine to work and after they cut me off twice, I was trying to talk to someone from india who could not speak English and was in a room with 100 people, when I asked to be transfered to someone else, she put me on hold for 20 more minutes and I git a male indian who I could not understand and after 30 minutes of struggling with his English I gave up.I am sending this thing back, it will not recognize Vista, and it does not recognise another computer I have which has XP. I did the steps correct becuase it DID recognize two comp I have with new versions of XP. The biggest problem is their customer service. I was on hold for over 90 minutes and never got my problem solved.I sent emails as well and got nothing.If you are an IT expert then you might be OK but if you are a IT savvy lay person who wants a home router THIS IS NOT THE COMPANY TO BUY FROM, they are a tech head supply firm for people who know the lingo and can do advanced configurations.</review>

<review id="6005">I read Twilight on the recommendation of one of the students who attends the university I work for.  I should probably mention that this was a law student who is in her mid twenties. I have to say, I didn't care for it much, and Bella Swan (that Stephenie Meyer gave her main female protagonist the completely subtle and not-ham- fisted-at-all-really name "Beautiful Swan" was an immediate source of hilarity right from page one) is easily one of the most overt examples of Mary Sue-ism I've ever encountered in published, professional fiction. In spite of this, since the book is one in a series, I decided to read "New Moon" (I work in a library, so what would it cost me really except a bit of time?) in the hope that the series would show signs of improving.  It did actually, which earned it the single star I've given NM.  More on that a bit later.What I was specifically looking for was an improvement in the portrayal of Edward's character.  According to the author, Edward was dying of the flu at the age of 17 in the very early part of the 20th century.  Even at 17, Edward would have been considered and behaved very much more like an adult than his modern counterpart.  Beyond this, since being transformed into a vampire has enabled him to have "lived" for well over 100 years, he is extensively world traveled, and was present for every major societal change and event within that time period (WWI, WWII, just to name two of the most obvious events).  Yet none of these things is reflected in his character in the least bit.  That is, he gives no indication of having gained the intellectual insight or emotional wisdom that anyone would acquire who was the least bit intelligent and had an infinite amount of time to acquire them. I understand that this series is primarily aimed at very young people, but even so, any fiction, especially if it's considered good enough to publish professionally, has to have some sort of core consistency in terms of the rules that the author has established for how the world that they've created operates.  The world of NM is exactly like ours except that it includes vampires and werewolves.  This being the case, why is Edward, who, in spite of the obvious differences, is essentially a 110 year old man, even capable of being reduced to some sort of girlie moo cow over a teenager?  Because she smells tasty?  I'm sorry.  No.  Edward is over a century old, yet has the mental processes of an emotionally effeminate pubescent boy. In terms of authorship and character development, this is indefensible.The author does a noticeably better job with Jacob's character, and earns a single star for no other reason.Jacob exhibits recognizably age appropriate habits, interests, and behaviors.  Even his interest in Bella (ha!) seems more authentic, as there are at least reasons that can be pointed to that might justify it (why wouldn't he have developed a crush on the cute enough and slightly older girl he'd met a few years earlier?)  He's inherently the most likable character of the series so far, and for the sake of the readers, I hope she's done nothing to ruin him.  Under ideal circumstances, he would have only improved along the way. I won't ever know, because this is the last book in the series that I'll be reading.</review>

<review id="6008">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      Nearly everything has already been said and written about this movie. However, consider this for the sheer level of stupidity we are talking about: Sam's great-great-grandfather discovers Megatron in the arctic ice in 1897; Sam is also supposed to be a typical teenager getting his first car and is at most 17 years old. If we allow for some 30 years between generations, then his great-great-grandfather would have been born 137 years ago (4 generations, i.e. 4x30 years). That means around 1870 - make that 1860 to account for late bloomers in the family. In any case he would have been in his late 20s or 30s at the time of the expedition, which by itself makes perfect sense - arduous arctic voyages are a young man's game. And yet the movie portrays him as an old man! Played in fact by veteran actor William Morgan Sheppard, who was already in his early 70s at the time of production. Doesn't this kind of say it all? It either means that everybody involved in the movie was a moron, from the director all the way down; or that they assumed their audience was so infantile, that they could never conceive of a great-great-grandfather as having been a young man. Why harp on a minor point? Because it could have been so easily avoided and because it makes it impossible to give this movie any benefit of the doubt. You can forgive all the nonsense and ignore the plot holes for the sake of entertainment, but you don't need to get insulted in the process.</review>

<review id="6009">I have never written a review of anything in my life.  When Final Draft 7 crashed for the umpteenth time today, I felt compelled to.  I am a working screenwriter who has been using Final Draft since version 5.  All told, six years.  Whatever bug that caused FD6 to randomly crash in OSX HAS NOT been fixed, despite what Final Draft says.  At least in Final Draft 7 the crash doesn't render my file "incompatable with this version of Final Draft" -- if any of you out there have had that happen, I deeply pity you, as you understand what it's like to be that maze-bound rat that randomly receives electric shocks.Throw in the fact that this product is edging toward $250.00 (nearly as much as digital video editing programs), the fact that customer support costs $2.00 a minute -- you heard me right, $2.00 a minute to ask them ANYTHING, no matter how small -- and you get a clear impression of a company that peddles severely inferior software becuase they know they have the market locked.  This is, however, NOT THE CASE.  25% of people that use screenwriting apps DO NOT USE FINAL DRAFT, becuase there are vastly superior programs out there.  As of today, I am a proud member of the 25%.Thanks to easy .pdf file conversion, anyone can use any screenwriting app they like.  Those that for some reason do decide to purchase this product, I implore you to change your preferences so you auto-save every five minutes, as this is the only way you won't lose a day's work, a week's work -- or God forbid, if don't back up your files -- an entire script.</review>

<review id="6010">**SPOILERS**I found this to be an interesting read, but I was ultimately disappointed with the conclusion.  The entire series has played up the sacrifices Bella would need to make if she became a vampire: her family, her ability to have children, possibly her soul, etc.  Bella's relationship with Jacob showed how difficult and poignant this choice could be: she could see her future with Jacob, and part of her wanted that future.  But ultimately, she makes the choice to be with Edward and sacrifice everything.But as it ends up, Bella sacrifices NOTHING for her choice.  She conveniently becomes pregnant before she is turned, Charlie is told--more or less--about her condition, and Jacob can still be a part of her life in a purely platonic sense.  All in all, the book seemed very anti-climatic.  Even when the Cullens ultimately confront the Volturi, there is no fight or loss; instead, the Volturi, the most feared vampires in the world, just turn around and go home.  There was no loss on either side.  It all seemed way too easy to me.Like many other reviewers here, I didn't like the idea of Jacob imprinting on Nessie, but for different reasons.  I didn't mind the idea of him imprinting on a baby--when Quil did the same thing in "Eclipse," it was explained that those relationships remained purely platonic until the child came of age.  But Jacob's sudden attachment to Nessie seems to invalidate everything that happened between Jacob and Bella in the previous books.  Bella and Jacob were in love, and it was visibly painful for them to be around one another after she chose Edward.  Then suddenly, Jacob's attachment to Bella can be explained away by, "It was just because I was destined to be your daughter's one-and-only."  Again, way too easy...and too convenient.</review>

<review id="6011">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Full-Screen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      This is easily the most overrated movie of all time. It's full of literally hundreds of lapses in plot, logic, realism, consistency, fidelity to the comics, etc...Christian Bale and not-Katie-Holmes have attended the Matrix School of Non-Acting. Morgan Freeman plays the SAME CHARACTER THAT HE HAS PLAYED IN EVERY MOVIE THAT HE HAS EVER BEEN IN. The plot is simply impossible to follow and has holes ranging from the timing of the bank robbery to the decision to blame Batman for deaths that he could not have possibly caused (like the driver of the car that was transporting Harvey). Batman can fall from literally any height and suffer no injuries whatsoever as long as he lands on a car. The cars in Gotham City are apparently made of pillows. Gun barrels seems to be made of similarly flimsy material. Cutting someone's cheek open kills them instantly. The Joker is the most inconsistent character ever written. He wants to kill Batman, then he doesn't. He has some high-minded ideology about Gotham deserving a "better class of criminal", then has no ideology except wanting to watch the world burn. He hatches impossibly elaborate plans and plots that would put even the Riddler to shame, then talks about how he has no plans and just likes to annoy people who do have them. WTF. The "save Harvey or save not-Katie-Holmes" thing was a TOTAL ripoff of the Green Goblin's similar stunt in Spider-Man 1... which was, in turn, a ripoff of a similar scene in Batman Forever. Harvey's conversion to the "dark side" was even more sudden and unconvincing than Anakin's in Revenge of the Sith ("Let's see, do I kill the guy who killed my girlfriend, or kill the guy who tried to save her? Gee, that's a tough one! I think I'll toss a coin to decide"). The only believable thing about Two-Face was the makeup/CGI job, which was outstanding and flawless, and is the REAL Oscar material of the movie. The nonsense with the ferry boats was cheap and annoying, and carried no real suspense. And instead of winding up to a climax, the story just dragged on and on and on... and on. And on.The Joker of the comic books had genuinely white skin and green hair as a result of a toxic chemical bath, used lethal pranks like the acid-squirting flower and a joy buzzer that electrocuted people, and liked to use a special gas/venom that caused its victims to laugh themselves to death. The Tim Burton/Jack Nicholson Joker lived up to this. The Chis Nolan/Heath Ledger Joker is just some deranged guy in makeup who has nothing to do with the comic books. Of course, neither of them came close to Mark Hamill in the animated series, but that's a whole different discussion...All of this covers less than ten percent of what is wrong with The Dark Knight.The whole thing is a mess and a disappointment.</review>

<review id="6014">I slice many whole pieces of Italian meats - Salami, Mortadela, and  procuitto.  This slicer is a basic, economical home slicer and does not perform anywhere close to a deli slicer.  The unit itself it to  small to take a large product and the blade runs to slow for doing a good job on hard cheese. The engine actually starts to smoke on the tough jobs.  Additionally, it really can not achieve a super thin slice - it is just not that robust.But, what do you expect for $100??  It does slice and for small products and a limited amount of slicing it can do the job. If you want to slice larger pieces and/or achieve thin perfect slices - move to a bigger blade and more powerful engine.</review>

Even though I clean the filter often and adjusted the pump per other peoples suggestions, it still seems to leak around the back of the unit.

<review id="6020">To be honest, I haven't brewed coffee in this machine so I can't comment on the quality of the coffee it makes. I'm returning it unused because the #4 filters they tell you to use don't fit. They stick out of the basket more than a quarter of an inch. When you swing the basket into place, there's a plastic feed arm that is supposed to automatically swing over the center of the filter basket. However, because the #4 filter sticks up so high, the arm can't swing over. I tried cutting the filters down and that worked better but who wants to do that every time? Also, to fill the reservoir you have to use the carafe. No big deal. Except there's a piece on the top of the carafe that has to be taken off  for the brewing process and then put back on if you want to keep the coffee warm in the carafe. This machine is way too much trouble.</review>

<review id="6022">I have been using Taxcut loyally for twelve years and have been satisfied until this year.  I typically file in late January or early February.

Note that the IRS has made this publication available as of February 1, 2009.I am stuck waiting for Taxcut to update the software which tech support indicated is not going to happen until later in February.

<review id="6023">A fair warning to all who think they want to upgrade from the old version to the new Platinum version.  The motor is the worst part of this product.  I bought the new model having used the old version for a very long time - never had to replace a motor on the old model.  The old model was used for 3 cats, 2 of whom lived to the ages of 19 and 16.  I thought I would treat my remaining cat and myself to the upgrade.  I had it for two hours - it seemed to run beautifully and my cat went to this fountain more than the previous one.  He loved it.  It stopped working after 2 hours.  I contacted the company via email and they keep insisting that I should clean the motor before they will ship a new motor.  They say it is because during manufacturing and packaging particles may be lodged when combined with water creates a clog.  I say that is a DESIGN/MANUFACTURING and PACKAGING defect.  I should not have to pull apart a brand new motor.  These should be inspected at manufacturing and packaged to prevent this problem if they are aware that it exists.  NOT WORTH THE AGGRAVATION.  I have gone back to using the old one which is still running fine after all these years.</review>

<review id="6024">MS Office 2007 is the worst Microsoft product ever develpoed. I would like to use Excel 2007 as an example to explain my point of view:1) The so-called "Ribbon" is so tall that it occupies almost a quarter of my notebook screen, further more, you get status bar and task bar, NOT MUCH SPACE LEFT for you to work in. The thumnail in the ribbon is not nearly as nice as those pop-up windows in older versions.2) When you try to change a line style in a graph, this version update the entire screen instead of a sample-view in the pop-up window, thus, comsuming a lot of CPU power and slows down computer tremendously. You really need to upgrade your hardware to run office 2007.3) If you have multiple data sets (say 10 sets) in a graph and you want to change the data range, you'll find that it's a big headache to do so in version 2007, because you have to pop up new windows 10 times instead of once in older version.4) When open my old Excel files in this version, all VBA codes got lost.5) Overall, the Office 2007 has a new look but much worse performance. I would not spend a penny for this junk!!!</review>

<review id="6026">I bought the machine after reading the reviews here. I also bought the 2 GB RAM upgrade - that's where I went wrong. The machine worked fine out of the box. I spent several hours installing programs. Then I put the new RAM in. It's pretty easy. You unscrew two screws, take out the old module, and insert the new one. I did and then turned on the machine or I tried to. It was dead. No hard drive light. I called Asus tech support, it took a while for them to answer, but they concluded that the machine was a corpse. So I've sent it back. It looked like a pretty good value before it died. I don't know how installing a new RAM module would kill a hard drive (and neither did Asus tech support), but that's what happened. The machine ran fine with 1 GB. So I think if you decide to make the plunge and buy one be careful about fooling around with the innards of the computer. I sent it back. It was in my house for about 12 hours. I've owned dozens of computers  and have six now. None has ever met its maker this quickly.Caveat emptor.</review>

<review id="6028">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)      Make no mistake, the Dark Knight is one of the best films ever, if not the best film ever. It's a must buy for any fan of movies and obviously of Batman. There's only one very big problem... where the hell are all the extras?! I mean yeah there are documentaries, making of stuff, but dammit where are the audio commentaries?! Not even a written commentary?! What... the... hell? When a movie makes 500 million freaking dollars I expect the studio to release a DVD that has everything, audio commentaries, written commentaries, deleted scenes, alternate endings, extended scenes, interviews, the works! I mean what the hell were you thinking Warner Brothers?! Why couldn't you give us a quality DVD experience here??? Yeah, I plan on buying this 2 disc edition, but I can't help but feel really cheated because Warner Brothers pulled the same crap when they released Batman Begins on DVD. No audio commentaries or anything special there either. Anyways, I'm sure the picture and sound is great. Again, that's a given, that is expected when you buy a movie on DVD. Let me emphasize again, this is a movie that made 500 million freaking dollars and they couldn't even give us all the extras that come standard with the majority of DVD releases today! I am insulted.</review>

<review id="6031">Our baby loves to be swaddled, so when she started to outgrow the receiving blankets we had, we purchased the Swaddle Me large size. It only comes in large or small. She was 14+ pounds when we bought it, so within their weight range for that size. It's a great idea, but the Swaddle Me is far far too big for her. It goes around her one a half times. It's as if the people who made the blanket never tested it on real babies. You can't make it tight enough to get that cozy feeling that is the whole point of swaddling. There is only a small space where the velcro tabs stick. I don't understand why they don't make the whole blanket sticky for the velcro (it's not scratchy) so that you could secure it as tightly or loosely as you need to. For our next baby I will purchase The Miracle Blanket instead, and that is what I would recommend to anyone looking for a swaddle blanket.</review>

<review id="6032">I have given up using the Toshiba external drive. It is unbelievably slow, due to its USB connection. If you want to store large files or lots of data, the USB connection is a real disadvantage. More importantly, the drive's erratic behavior has resulted in my losing valuable files and has caused me hours of needless work. Just getting it to connect to and be recognized by my computer was always a problem. However, after a couple month's use, it began to repeatedly and unpredictably appear and disappear from my desktop - sometimes in the middle of saving files. Of course, the files were lost or rendered useless. I should point out that I've been using the drive with a MacBook Pro, and maybe the drive isn't truly compatible with Mac products. However, you'd never know that from the information on and in the box, both of which say it is Mac-compatible. I have had no trouble with Firelite or Western Digital drives, and would recommend them over this poor piece of engineering.</review>

<review id="6034">I feel so angry and cheated. Breaking Dawn is a disgrace to the Twilight name. Stephenie- what happened?!!? Gah! The whole story is off- the characters become emotionless and shallow. I even was against Edward and rooting for Jake most of the book. Until he became compassionate to the mutant vampire-human thing that Bella gave birth to. After chapter 7 or 8 I began screaming at the book. 'What the heck!!!!' And when did Jasper became Jazz and Rose became- well completely insane?!!? The only charaters that retained some sort of their previous likability were Seth and Carlisle. Alice even lost it and disappeared for a huge chunk of the book!! I wish the book is a joke- but its not. Stop at chapter 7 if you havn't read it yet and imagine a new ending.</review>

<review id="6035">This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series (DVD)      Panoramic scenes of breathtaking beauty form the background of this remarkably dull yet amazingly cruel Series.A true remake of Mondo Cane (1962), in this series, poor David Attenborough has the sad task of narrating the 'story' of each episode: inevitably about predators hunting other animals, eating them, killing weaklings and young.The series is uninterested about the Planet Earth - you want to see more of it, but unfailingly the producers want to show you animals being eaten by predators, for they went to great trouble to film it and want you to see it. Not how animals or birds live - but how they die.Each kill is shown in sadistic detail, so that you can see the poor victim's last moments of pain and terror. You will soon see they or their chicks or cubs in their predators jaws still alive and then being dragged and killed - the camera will still linger long enough for you to see them eating their prey.When you see an animal, any animal or bird - you already know that in a few moments time you will see their predators, time over time again this will be repeated.In this series Animals are shown only this context: of killing and dying, for that is what interest the makers of this series , the killing of weak and young animals. Nature is shown in short quick takes - monotonous text is reread by David Attenborough , for every episode is just a re-run of the previous one. They follow the same format. You saw one, you saw them all. You wonder how the Producer of Blue Planet managed to create such a series.Anything is better than this series.Do yourself a favor and buy any of David Attenborough's great series, buy Blue Planet - head over shoulders better than this stupid disgusting series, a waste of your money and time.</review>

<review id="6039">The trouble with Breaking Dawn, and it is trouble, is that the characters don't develop the way that they did in the earlier novels. The novel reads quickly enough, and I was interested enough to finish it, but in the end it was a disappointment. The plot tied things up neatly, everyone getting what everyone wanted. After reading it, you would expect to come away satisfied. Unfortunately, this story just doesn't seem right. Perhaps the author was determined to have a happy ending, and skewered the plot to fit. There were too many conflicts in the story to allow for such a resolution. Bella's pregnancy simply did not work as a plot device. The reader will recognize the symptoms of her pregnancy pages before Bella herself realizes what is happening. I found that just plain irritating. The fact that Jacob imprints on Bella's daughter was weird. Jacob was so in love with Bella, and now he chooses her daughter? I couldn't accept that.I also have to agree with other reviewers. The message this novel sends to young people is not a positive one.  It is not a terrible novel, but it is a disappointment. The earlier novels in this series were much better. I have to agree with the overall negative tone of the reviewers.</review>

<review id="6040">[...] When my keyboard started opening search windows all by itself! with the letters asd in them- I found it was a defect with the light- which is WHY I bought this keyboard. Their site's forum (see link above) had many instances of the same and other forms of freaking out. If you turn off the light- it stops this behavior- but when you reboot- it defaults back to the light on high (worst). I left my pc to reboot before going to bed and forgot about my problem and in the morning I heard error sounds- the keyboard had so many search windows opened- it took several minutes to close them all (had no group option?). Because I need lighted keys- I am now in search of a new keyboard. PS- gamers say keys rub off QUICKLY and Saitek just sends them new ones. BOTTOM LINE- IF you buy this keyboard- SAVE YOUR RECEIPT= chances are you will need it- if it happens within 2 years. My research says Eclipse II fixed erratic behavior but not keys wearing out. Please post reviews on your purchases- people like me depend on other's experiences! Thanks</review>

<review id="6042">The one good thing about this book is that it exposes how difficult it is to eat anything healthy at most restaurants.  Even choosing the so-called healthier choices did not leave you with any room for any kind of dessert (even fruit), most of the time.On the smoothies (and condiments as well) the comparisons are inaccurate because you're not comparing the same amounts. Should be ounce for ounce (or teaspoon for teaspoon), not a 7 oz. container with a 10 or 12 oz container. The Volumetrics books are much better in regards to telling you how much you can eat if you make the right choices, because, for example, you tend to dump a certain amount of cereal in your bowl, regardless of the kind, simply out of habit.And, just as in the Picture Perfect Weight Loss books, potato salad or coleslaw can have anywhere from 2-3 ingredients to 10, so how can you make blanket statements about one being better than the other unless you know exactly what's in it?The most useful parts of the book are near the beginning, "8 Foods You Should Eat Every Day", where he has a few recipes, and near the end, with "What to Eat When You're Tired, Stressed, or in the Mood" The rest of the book, with its very loud format, gets difficult to read after a while.Definitely borrow from your library if you need a reminder of how unhealthy most restaurant food really is.</review>

I used the blender exclusively for smoothies, usually made with chunks of frozen banana, OJ, and yogurt. I was careful to make sure the blender was running and there was plenty of juice in the jar, but the &quot;all metal drive&quot; broke - there is actually a hard rubber coupling beneath the drive spindle, and it sheared right off. Oh well - on to the next blender! I also have to agree with other reviewers about the noise - this puppy will wake the dead! Don't plan on making midnight snacks with it.</review>

<review id="6044">The good points of this product have been touched on in other reviews. I will not rehash them here.I owned this keyboard for approximately 3 months. It operated well, although I did have problems with the amount of desk real estate it required - it is a large keyboard. This is a minor issue, however. The main problem I had is that one day the number keys refused to work.  It isn't a software issue, as I've tried it on other computers with no success. I've owned other Logitech products and they are nice until they break after a few months.  I've bought 2 headsets, this keyboard, and a mouse that periodically glitches on me from Logitech.  With the shoddy performance I have experienced I can't recommend their products to anyone.</review>

<review id="6045">I purchased my 1st unit in Sept. 2006.  It worked well and performed as advertised.  Then in Dec. 2006 it got stuck on "NOT READY".  This was after 3 months of daily use of 1-3 cups.  I called Keurig and they sent a replacement unit. UPS delivered the brand new replacement unit yesterday.  I followed the instructions closely to prime the unit.  The very 1st cup out of the unit was incorrect.  The brewing cycle is anywhere from 1:15 to 2:00 for a cup.  The unit will stop in the middle of the brewing process for 30-45 seconds and then continue.  The amount of coffee seems to be independent of the actual brewing settings.  I'll get anywhere from 8 to 14oz of liquid at the 11.25 oz setting, from 4 to 8 oz at the 5.25 oz setting, etc.Overall, if it worked, I'd enjoy it, but considering it is the "top of the line" model, the performance is very poor.  If I knew it was going to be this much trouble I would not have purchased it.I'll update my comment after speaking with Keurig. Edit: The replacement was defective and Keurig is shipping me another unit.  I'll update this after my 3rd unit arrives.  Update 5/8/07 - the 3rd unit was sent 2nd day air directly from Keurig. I've had zero issues with the current unit - it works well, brews quickly.  I just wish I could use the unit without the small thought in the back of my mind - is it going to break again?</review>

<review id="6046">and they broke after a few months. I love how this machine looks, but I'm on the lookout for a more reliable coffee maker.</review>

<review id="6047">I'm really baffled by how many good reviews there are for this product.  Oh well, all I can do is relate my own experience, and that is that this product is a complete waste.  It just flat out doesn't work (well).  I'm not sure whether it's that the blade isn't sharp enough or long enough, of just that it is poorly designed and conceived.  Whatever.  Time to move on to another product.Note: I recently bought the Panasonic ER421KC and like it MUCH better.  It just eliminates hair much much more effectively.  It costs a little more, but boy is it worth it.</review>

<review id="6048">I've had this thing for two weeks and it does nothing for my Beagle. I thought it would work because of these reviews here saying it's just wonderful. Some times it sprays, sometimes it doesn't. Whether or not it decides to spray, doesn't matter as she is fine running around barking with it spraying. So two weeks after the fact I'm lacking sleep and am stressed over this thing and I lost out on an amount of money that isn't meant to just try items that don't work!</review>

<review id="6049">Let me be blunt, this is a piece of junk.  I run a computer repair business and I've had many jobs whereby I had to fix this specific router.  I've made a lot of money fixing people WiFi due to this router.  If you are using a wired connection, you'll be fine.  But the wireless network is going to fail you at some time.  Here is how you fix it.  From a WIRED connection, access the router and backup your settings.  Do a factory reset.  Then do restore your backup settings.  It will then work again.  Of course, you can avoid this hassle by looking somewhere else for a router.In general, you should avoid any and all low-end Linksys products.  However, the pricier Linksys products, such as the WRT54GL (the one with L at the end) is a quality router.  But this one is junk worthy only of your trash can.</review>

<review id="6050">I used it six times. Six times. I liked the quality, I liked the size and everything about it, until it stopped working. It would not power on on the seventh try and I tried holding the button down, resetting it as the troubleshooting suggests, and nothing. I'm glad it was a gift, but upset that I got such little use out of it. It wasn't expensive and I guess it's true that you get what you pay for. It could have been a great product. I can't endorse it however. Six times.</review>

<review id="6052">The sheets are nice. I like them. What I don't like is when you buy an item and it takes them 2 months to ship it to you. If I would have known, I would have never purchased the sheets. I bought the item when it was "in stock" NOT when it was on backorder.</review>

<review id="6053">Before a month was up the pump quit. So I had to send it to a service center because it was a couple of days over the return period. After another 2 months waiting for it, I got it back to have it work less than a month. Horrible!! We are experienced Espresso people, Have a Big pro machine in the kitchen but wanted this as an extra for down stairs. I've gone thru tons of smaller cheap machines, don't expect them to withstand the use we give them but this machine was the worst we ever bought in the less expensive lines.</review>

<review id="6056">Bought this device as I was thinking it would be another easy-to-use SanDisk product. I guess it does fulfill the basic function you expect from a memory stick; HOWEVER two things are hugely annoying: 1) When you plug in the device for the first time, you receive a message that it has been installed successfully. Yet, the device does not identify itself with a name; so if you have several removable USB storage devices hooked up at the same time (also not specifically identified) then the guessing game begins. I wanted a simple back-up memory stick - why do I have to click on/push fifteen buttons to find out where to drag the data to, and how to safely remove the hardware before unplugging it ...?Very annoying and NOT AT ALL customer friendly -as other reviewers have remarked before me- are the constant reminders to sign-up for the online features. (It'll be a cold day in hell when I trust an online site with my personal data ...!!!)In short: I'm thinking about returning it - too annoying and too much hassle, even for $40 (which is what I still paid for it).</review>

<review id="6057">Twilight, the first in the series, was well worth my time. The second installment, New Moon, gets grating and annoying.

But then again, I've not been a teenager in a while.</review>

<review id="6058">I had never owned an electric razor and decided to give this much lauded device a try.

<review id="6059">I recently bought then returned this little machine.  It runs office suite adequately, boot-up time is good, video is comfortable to view for a while.  All around it initially looked to be a perfect machine for me.  But I had a flaw that makes this netbook unusable to me.Fatal Flaw:  When the wireless internet is running there is (at least on the one I received) some kind of hardware conflict with the sound card.  It doesn't matter if I am playing mp3s, listening to internet radio or listening to sounds from software there are intermittent cracks, stutters, pops and distortions.  These problems go away when the wireless internet is off, but then again how useful is a netbook where you have to decide between net and audio.  I gave this item 2 stars because the potential for this machine to be perfect for my needs is there, but in light of my defective product I can't justify any higher of a rating.I have returned this to amazon.com and hopefully I have no issue with refund.</review>

<review id="6063">I have used TurboTax for 10+ years now, and it has been a great tool.However, this year they have made a big change:  removing the Sch D support from the Deluxe version.  You now will need to get the Premier version....I have also noticed over the years that in addition to a steady price increase, they pitch more and more 'Would you like to upgrade' screen.  Last year was rather bad, it seemed I spent as much time getting through the 'Ads' as I did using the product.Good side, product has been easy to use and a good value to me.  But given the consistent price increase, the increased 'upgrade' pitches, and now the dropping of a key feature forcing me to a higher version:  I am going to try out TaxCut this year.</review>

<review id="6064">The WRT600N has quality control problems.  The first two that I had lost connectivity with the modem at random times.  The third router worked perfectly right out of the box.  You have to demand a replacement after you go through tech support's routines and it still does not work.  Be advised that replacement routers are not new.  Both of the ones I received were reconditioned.  They had scratches and one was even sent with the wrong power cord.  If you look at the reviews you see people that love the router and people that have had a bunch of problems.  That tells me that quality control is the issue.</review>

<review id="6065">I had such high hopes for this camera!  I purchased the Flip Video Ultra (60 minutes) right before Christmas 2007.  I used it a few times and was extremely happy with it until about February, when suddenly the software stopped working on my Windows XP system.  I tried to re-install but got a constant "Installation aborted" error message.  Multiple phone calls were unhelpful.  More than once the customer support person simply hung up on me.  Other times, I was given an email address of a second-tier support level, but many of my emails went unanswered.   Occasionally I'd get a reply but it was clear that the support staff were not really understanding (or reading?) what I'd written.  Nearly every reply from Tech Support instructed me to install their updated software from the website, but I got the same error message every time and had already tried that option on my own.   They seemed to disregard this fact when reading my emails, suggesting the same thing over and over.  Every single email I wrote took at least 24 hours to receive a reply, drawing out what might have been a simple issue into a several-day-long nuisance.  Communication was so difficult with the support techs that in the end, I gave up and sadly put the Flip Video away for good.  If they'd had a phone number I could call for real support (rather than their existing system of people to refer me to an email address), I think things might have gone differently.  As it is, I'm unbelievably frustrated after spending more than I should have on what is now completely useless.  I'd been planning to purchase two more of these little cameras for my kids for Christmas this year, but there's no way I'd buy another one after this debacle.</review>

<review id="6067">This review is from: Slumdog Millionaire (DVD)      Slumdog is not the original movie on India's infamous slums. That's Mira Nair's Salaam Bombay (Widescreen Special Edition)I won't go into the usual fawning that most articles give slumdog since this movie too fits into a pattern.

<review id="6070">These are quite, affordable drives, but unfortunately, they are not compatible with the Mac as claimed! They do work, but only at USB 1.1 speeds. For some reason, the Mac will only recognize these drives at the slower USB 1.1 speeds, which means it would take 50 Hours to copy the content from the drive to another drive - totally worthless for any kind of archival purposes, which seems the main reason for these drives to exist.You can find work arounds for the 1.1 speed problem, but I've not been able to get my Mac to mount these drives at USB 2 speeds. Most unfortunate since I bought two of these units. So if you have a Mac, try another solution!</review>

<review id="6072">If you have never used MS Office before then ignore this review, because you are unlikely to be bothered by the issues raised here.As an advanced Excel user for nearly twenty years, I have to say that Microsoft has rolled out the software equivalent of new Coke.Many professionals learned spreadsheets back in the 1980s when Lotus 123 enabled tremendous advances for ordinary business users.  One of the great strengths of Microsoft Excel, when it became ready for Prime Time, was its ease of use for legacy 123 users.  At that time, 123 was THE spreadsheet program for business and Excel was a newcomer trying to take market share.The latest version of Office is like a punch in the stomach for experienced users who have invested thousands of hours over many years mastering Excel, Word, PowerPoint and other software staples.  I have not noticed the problem with Word so much... how hard can one make typing, after all?  But new Excel is a productivity disaster.Does the Microsoft brain trust honestly believe that users hunt around with their mouse to execute spreadsheet commands?  The "ribbon" seems well-suited for that purpose and little else.  Any keystroke commands or muscle memory that you may have developed over the past two decades... forget about them.  Need to put together a last-minute graph?  Order out because you are not going to finish before dinner.  Whoever made the decision to NOT provide legacy keystroke support should have their head examined.I sincerely hope we can look forward to a service pack release to bring back "Office Classic."  Office 2007 may include features that, some day, I will come to appreciate.  But unless and until I find a need for them, I am downgrading.</review>

<review id="6073">I purchased this router to replace a D-Link router that stopped working after 4 years of service.  The WRT54G router actually slowed down my connection.  The Linksys support link told me to take it back to the store which I did but the replacement was the same.  Everytime that I called Linksys they would have me go through the same process and finally told me that it was my computer (which works fine without the Linksys router).  This statement was followed up by the tech support hanging up on me.  I don't believe this router is worth the trouble.</review>

<review id="6074">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      There's a certain melodrama to New Moon that makes its previous installment, Twilight, pale in comparison. Bella Swan's life is particularly complicated these days, what with the teenage angst and emotional turmoil. Not to belittle teenage angst, but Bella's version of it could be called Shakespearean if not for the giant billboards plastered all through the narrative that insist This Is Like Romeo And Juliet FULL STOP We Are Just As Emotionally Complicated And Tragic FULL STOP.The comparisons to Shakespeare beat the readers over the head repeatedly. This is a tragic relationship, we got it. We don't need a constant analysis of Romeo and Juliet, nor do we need a play by play concerning which character in New Moon most accurately compares to Paris.One point in New Moon that could be applauded would be that the story's topaz-eyed, bronze-haired, god-like Edward Cullen is absent for the majority of the book. Quite a bold move by the author, although it's wasted seeing as how the portions without Edward involve Bella acting like her life has literally ended. Instead of growing up and learning to exist without a perfect, beautiful boyfriend to guide her through life, Bella absolutely shuts down. Her only mild attempts to live occur only when she has Jacob to take on Edward's role, which suggests Bella is only fully functional when she has a man to please and be pleased by. This is particularly damning. Bella herself is easy to insist everything wrong be her fault, that she is simply too imperfect to deserve the attention she receives from the men in her life (hilarious, considering how many boys have fallen for her since the start of Twilight) and that she is just so painfully plain and human that she is nothing -- that her life is nothing -- without Edward by her side. She is incapable of being alone, of growing to support herself when no one else can. She is so dependent on Edward (and, to an extent, on Jacob) that whatever dangerous situation she intentionally (as her life means nothing now, without Edward) puts herself in that her own subconscious will tell her her actions are stupid and she should save herself not in her own voice, but in Edward's. This is shaky ground, as Bella lacks character anyway, striping her subconscious and replacing it with Edward's voice makes her seem less of an independent woman, much less a person.There is no personal growth in New Moon for Bella or Edward. If anything, these two characters regress. The character that does make massive strides in terms of character development is Jacob Black, who will most likely be doomed to playing Edward's second fiddle and arch enemy.Stephenie Meyer's third book in the Twilight series, Eclipse, comes out August 7th. While Edward and Bella continue their angst-ridden obsession with immortality and death and each other, one wonders if Jacob isn't the only thing worth reading about.</review>

<review id="6078">I purchased this toaster in November of 2007 from Amazon.  Yesterday, it broke.  The product brochure told me that the toaster has a 3 year warranty.  I called Cuisinart.

<review id="6079">The minor problem is that the user manual claims the user ID is "admin". Well, it is not. Frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user ID should be left blank to log in.The major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted. After twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network. Once you unplug and plug back the power cord, it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours. I am used to rebooting Windows every time it hangs, but I don't accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs (I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hang). This box is going back. I already bought a Buffalo that works fine.</review>

<review id="6085">I recently bought a new laptop, and the changeover involved an "upgrade" to Office 2007. I was aware that there was a new user interface, but was not aware that Office 2007 is, in almost every respect, an INFERIOR product to any Office version that came before it!I have used MS Office for many years, and am what could be called a "power user," especially for Word and Powerpoint, which I use weekly.One of the great features of Office is that it has been totally customizable. For those who use office frequently, it has been easy to create your own custom toolbars so you have what you need easily available. Most tasks could be done with one or two mouse clicks... Until Office 2007!In Office 2007, hardly anything is customizable! You have a constantly changing tool ribbon, which takes up a lot of screen real estate.The ribbon presents a set of icons based on what it "thinks" you will need at the moment. It is rarely right! ... so you go searching through the tabs trying to find the icon that was on the ribbon a few moments earlier! There is one small "tool bar" up on the title bar that you CAN customize, but it is not convenient, and will not hold many icons. It has the option of being moved below the ribbon, which takes up even more screen real estate, but is still very limited, and cannot be docked or moved from there.Granted, there are third party programs, such as Ribbon Customizer and Toolbar Toggle, that add back some of the ability to customize, but it is still far inferior to what Office users are used to!Even the third party programs, however, cannot get around the fact that there are some features in earlier Office versions that are simply NOT included in the new one. In previous versions of Powerpoint, you could add a set of icons that, with one mouse click, allowed you to adjust the vertical spacing of text. That has been omitted in 2007. In the "improved" 2007 version, you must open a dialog box, and make several mouse clicks to adjust vertical spacing!To make matters worse, Office 2007 documents are not compatible with earlier versions. After spending years establishing formats such as .doc and .ppt as industry standards, Microsoft has introduced a version of office that does not use these formats! If you want to send a document to someone who still has Office 2003 (or any other program that reads .doc files) you need to remember to save it in that format. The default 2007 format cannot be opened by earlier versions!Office 2007 CAN open the older formats, but even in opening earlier Office formats, there are problems. For example, most users of Powerpoint have learned the trick of adding drop shadows behind the text to make the text stand out on the screen. Office 2007 has changed the way these shadows are formed. When you open a powerpoint presentation made on an earlier version, your old drop shadows WILL NOT ANIMATE with the text. When a slide appears, the shadows of the letters are already in place, and the letters animate in on top! Mircosoft's only suggestion... go through your slides and take the old shadows out, and put new shadows in! (I tried this... it takes 30-40 minutes per presentation! ...And I have hundreds of powerpoint presentations in my file!)For someone who never used Office before, or who just uses Word to type simple letters, 2007 may be okay, but for anyone who depends on Office for detailed tasks and productivity, 2007 is a nightmare.I have always loved Microsoft Office. It has been an industry standard for ease of use. In my opinion, that is no longer the case. I believe Microsoft tried to produce something "different" to attract new users, but in the process totally ignored the needs of those who have used their products in the past. If you have the option of staying with an earlier version, DO NOT UPGRADE to this product!</review>

<review id="6086">The iomega hard drive worked great...for the first 4 days. Then I accidently pulled out the cord and it tipped over. Now it just makes beeping noises and my computer won't detect the device at all. I contacted iomega support and they didn't really look into the problem at all, just told me i'd have to return it and they would send another. The problem is, I have tons of data, etc. that I put on it. I might have backed up this data, but I certainly didn't expect the hard drive to stop working after simply tipping over! Now it looks like it will cost anywhere from $200-$2000 to get my data back, which includes $1000 of songs and $60 of video, not to mention pictures and word documents that I wanted to save. I don't have this kind of money. I can't believe that it died just from falling on its side. Do NOT use the stand provided! Lay the device on its side, though personally I don't think I'm willing to try another iomega product. The reason I bought it was to get tons of data off my computer; I didn't want to have to buy ANOTHER device to save the same data on with the expectation that it would fail!!</review>

<review id="6087">I have to say it: I think The Secret and The Law of Attraction are a bunch of garbage.  The idea of the Law of Attraction, as shown in the movie "The Secret" is that if you really picture something happening, and you put a lot of energy into it, and you focus all your intent and emotions into it, that it will happen. Here's the proof that The Secret doesn't work:Six million men subscribe to Playboy.  There are a couple dozen women featured in each issue.  From my understanding, most of those men are not reading Playboy for the articles.  They are focusing all their emotions and their thoughts on having sex with one of those women.  They put time and energy and imagination into it.  They do everything that The Secret says.Now, divide six million male subscribers by, say, 200 women featured naked in Playboy every year.  Therefore, unless each woman featured in Playboy is having sex with 30,000 men each year, there's no way that men who imagine themselves with a woman from the magazine actually have their dreams come true.  In fact, if even 1% of those men were to achieve their fantasy with ANY woman in Playboy, not just a centerfold, that would mean that each woman would have to have sex with 300 men a year.  Somehow, I don't think that's happening.That's why I think The Secret is nonsense.Here are some other examples:Since The Secret is well known, it's practiced by a lot of people, including many who have coaches to tell them exactly how to do it.  This would include pageant contestants, PGA golfers, and professional athletes.  Yet, do you really think that Tiger Woods wins golf tournaments because he believes he will?  Or is it instead because he spends hours a day working on his swing?  The reason why Miss California or Miss Texas win more Miss America pageants than Miss Idaho or Miss Oklahoma is that the bigger, more populous states have more contestants at the lower levels, so that the Misses California and Texas have to beat more people, are more prepared, have more money, practiced more, and are more likely to be more beautiful and more talented than contestants who had less competition.  It's not a matter of wanting or thinking about it more.Or how about this: why don't celebrity stalkers get to meet their celebrity, other than in court when they're convicted and sentenced?  They clearly imagine conversations with the celebrity; they visualize it perfectly; they take steps to make it happen.  The Secret should work for them but it doesn't.(The people behind The Secret explain that failure to meet your goals is because deep, deep down, you didn't really believe it would work.  A convenient excuse.)Do you want other examples?  How about this:According to the Law of Attraction, you also would attract bad things to you if you think about them: they use the example of thinking about your debts and then receiving bills in the mail.  So does that mean that a two-year-old with leukemia somehow wished it?  Or her parents did?  Why don't mass murderers like Hitler just drop dead if millions of people want them to?  Did six million Jews die in the Holocaust because they thought about it?  How come suicidal people don't just have a heart attack and die?  Why does the abusive husband keep beating his wife if she wishes he were dead?  How come cancer researchers don't get more cancer than other people?  Or less, for that matter, since they're always thinking about a cure for cancer?  How come most lottery winners don't win as much money as they spend on the lottery, since clearly they're visualizing themselves winning every time they buy the ticket?  How come more prisoners don't escape from jail?  And for people who grew up rich, did they somehow imagine being born to rich parents while still in the womb?In order to believe in The Secret, you have to believe that good and evil things happen in the world because people wish them.  That's magical thinking and it's nonsense.There is a new movie about The Secret and how to make it work for you, called "Beyond The Secret."  I think that the people who make the movies make The Secret work by selling this stuff to willing believers.  The Secret makes them money as a marketing tool to part you from your money.  Rhonda Byrne is a very rich woman from repackaging ideas that have been around for decades.If you want to achieve wealth, save your money, live on less than you make, research investments and diversify your holdings.  Actions speak louder than thoughts.The astonishing thing to me is that more people aren't speaking up against this.  Try googling "The Law of Attraction is nonsense" or "The Law of Attraction is garbage" and you don't find much.  I feel like the child who says that the Emperor has no clothes!</review>

<review id="6088">To be fair, I haven't used this product since I purchased it a month ago.  I bought it thinking I'd save money.  I can't find a box of dry milk under $12, which you need in order to make yogurt.  A large container of yogurt is $3.99, sometimes less with coupons.  To bad I threw out the box, maybe could have returned it.  Instead of saving money, I've lost shelf space.</review>

<review id="6089">I've been using Quicken for many years. I generally upgrade every two years to see what's new, so I went from Premier 2007 to 2009. I haven't seen any new feature that means anything to me, the UI is less appealing than the previous UI, and 2009 had an annoying bug that they just fixed in r3. In summary, I like Quicken, but if you already have it, stick with what you have.</review>

<review id="6094">I have recently lost 30 lbs and bought this to check my progress in my fat loss. When I got it I was dissapointed in myself because of the high fat content. I thought I had made more progress, but this rated me at 28.1% fat. I used a skin fold caliper from the gym and it said I was 26.1% fat. Not too far off. I thought I could use it to track my progress. I started lifting weights 4 days a week for an hour and a half a session. I monitored my intake of protein, carbs, and fat. I drank 2 protein shakes with creatine and glutamine a day. I hit the treadmill for at least 30 minutes a day, 6 days a week. My weight dropped 4 pounds in a month, but the scale said I was losing muscle and fat. I was pretty upset with my progress. I was hoping it was the scale. I decided to read some of the negative reviews here at amazon and saw other people have similar experiences. One reveiwer did an experiment holding weights while standing on the scale and I thought I would try that. With no weights I was 27.1% fat, holding 10 lbs I was 28.6% fat, 20 lb weights = 29.9% fat, 30 lbs = 31.6% fat. This scale apparently just takes your weight, height, and age and gives you an average fat percentage. The scale said I was 27.1% fat. A loss of 1% body fat that month(loss of 3 lbs of fat and loss of 1 lb of muscle). I got the caliper from the gym again and found I had actually dropped to 22.6% fat in that month (lost 8 lbs of fat and gained 4 lbs of muscle). This scale almost made me give up on trying to get in better shape. I know it says its not for athletes, but they didn't give their definition of athlete. I certainly don't consider myself an athlete, but I guess the manufacturer of this scale does.If you workout at all, this scale is not for you. If your just on a diet, it's probably OK.</review>

<review id="6096">I've used Intuit to do my taxes since the days of MacInTax and I've been a very satisfied customer.  With 2008 Deluxe, though, I wish I had used another product. This has been the most frustrated I've been with any software product.The BIGGEST problem is the "new" update feature, which no longer works.  Now you need to be Administrator to update the program.  I don't like that but it's acceptable.  However, update only works about 5-10% of the time.  It hangs frequently.Say, for example, there are six modules that need to be updated.  It will try to download all six before installing any.  That means that if update #5 hangs (and Application Help Update nearly always hangs) then you can't install ANY updates.  It needs to finish ALL downloads before starting to install anything.I have tried all of the suggestions on the Intuit help pages.  I resort to downloading the updates outside of TurboTax and installing, and that works, but it's cumbersome.  This approach won't work if a State product needs to be updated.I'm very disappointed and frustrated.</review>

<review id="6097">I have been a Turbo Tax user for many years. This year prior to purchasing I read the reviews and read the comments relative the changes to this years product.  While Turbo Tax came back and made the changes that were being blasted I decided to try Tax Cut.  Now that I have I will be staying with that product.It is easier to use than Turbo Tax with the instructions being much more clear and understandable, (not that Turbo Tax was difficult but rather Tax Cut explained the issues in more easily understood terms).  Tax Cut also provided more additional explanations for the "unusual situations" and in a manner that easily lead one to identify if it related to my situation or not.Tax Cut is cheaper, more user friendly and I will continue to use it.  I am afraid Turbo Tax is an example of what happens when a good product becomes too sucessful and loses sight of servicing it's customers and puts the premium on squeezing out every penny in sales that it can.</review>

<review id="6099">I purchased this gate becasue of the self closing feature as well as the height. I have had the gate just over 1 month and it isn't closing properly. First, the bottom catch began not catching- so I had to push the bottom closed to secure it and AVOID my daughters head getting stuck between the bars. I uninstalled it, reinstalled it but nothing worked. This morning my 17 month old actually was able to push it open! (I had locked it and checked to be sure both top and bottom locks were locked and they were but she still pushed it open!) Its a good thing the top opened or my daughter's head would have been stuck in the gate!! I do not feel safe with this gate...I have three other kidco gates in my home of which one is 7years old and never had any problems with them!I would recommend a kidco gate for every home. If I could give this gate a NEGAtive star i WOULD!</review>

I left the cuff in the same position for each second reading.  Plus my wife brought a cuff to fit me.  I tried to check calibration with the Doctor and my wife.  They were both very close.  Then checking with the automatic BP machine, It would not even come close!Even when checking on the same arm without changing anything, the readins were so different.  i.e. 175/115.  Repeat without moving:  95/75.  One time it read 85/75.  I should be dead.  Normally I have 130/70.  And this is what the Doctor and my wife usually get.  At least within 5 points.Sorry, but I'll have to give this device a big old goose egg,  It is not worth it!</review>

<review id="6102">This book, along with the rest of the series is so over rated its not even funny. I am bewildered on how girls can be so obsessed by this book. It's an abomination from the literary view point, and the story line it self lacks substance. The main characters are horrendously annoying, it's pretty sad when the best characters in the story are the minor ones. I'm done stating reasons, their are many more I can gurentee it, but I should like to waste the least of my life on this series as possible. Good Day.</review>

<review id="6103">I've been a Norton user for many years but this one has me looking for another provider.  I haven't experienced the virus problems some have, just installation and maintenance problems.  LiveUpdate fails regularly and never returns clean with no updates.  Of particular note, pointing to the lack of adequate pre-release testing, the Backup facility does not backup changed files every time and does not backup what you think it does.  In addition, if you add a folder to be backed up, there is no way to remove it.  If you clear the check marks, they come back the next time a backup is started (and yes, I saved my settings!)  I would recommend you wait for version 3 or look for another product.</review>

<review id="6104">Before I watched this movie I knew little about it other than it was nominated for some Oscars.  After watching it I wonder why it got these nominations.  just like Dances with Wolves, evil white men do bad things to the natives, some good white men (women) are sympathetic to the natives, live with them and discover how good the natives are.  The plot can't be more predictable.  the whites (other than the main characters) are all bad, natives are all good.  very politically correct.</review>

<review id="6105">Being an old time Sci Fi junkie, I tried so hard to like this show but it just didn't happen for me.  I found the characters to be flat and inconsistent in their actions and to be too unlikeable that I just couldn't relate to them.  The production value isn't as great as advertised either.  The special effects are hit and miss with the shaky camera work and because of the expense, used sparingly.  But my biggest complaint being that scenes appeared in the "previous on Battlestar Galactica" that had NOT actually appeared in any of the previous episodes which throws off the continuity of the story. There was an interesting cliffhanger at the end of season 2 but after seeing some of season 3 it doesn't pay off for me. Overall, the series is just too grim and depressing without any hope or humor to be entertaining for me.</review>

<review id="6108">THE GOOD: 1. The brewed coffee tastes very good - and you might think that would be enough.2. It's attractive enough.3. Nice carafe.THE BAD:1. The water needs to be poured into a slim opening and if you're not very careful slops over the sides.  Who wants to be that careful when they need coffee?2. There is no external water gauge - you need to look down into the water resevoir to see how full it is.3. The control panel - why so many steps?  Rather than just turning to BREW you need to turn to brew and then press the ON button.  Same for everything else - auto set for a later time, then turn it on.  It's not a great chore, but why 2 steps rather than 1 for every function?4. THE ALARM!  It produces a high pitched alarm every time coffee is brewed!  AND YOU CAN'T DEACTIVATE IT!This is a problem in my house because my spouse and I wake up at different times, but both want coffee when we get up.  So whoever gets up first gets coffee - but whoever is still sleeping gets a high pitched ALARM while they're trying to snooze.The alarm can come in handy, and I've had other pots with the function, but it's absolutely insane that cuisinart added this function with NO ability for the consumer to deactivate it.I recommend the KitchenAid KCM400WH Pro 12 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker instead.  That was the product I replaced after it was damaged.  It was a very fine coffee maker with all the good points and none of the bad.</review>

<review id="6112">Don't be surprised if Office 2007 Excel costs companies millions if not billions of dollars in lost productivity and errors.  I would DEFINITELY NOT RELY on Excel 2007 for ANY ENGINEERING calculations or projects that could result in loss of life due to known calculation bugs.  Microsoft in my view has a history for screwing over power-users with releases that aren't backward-compatible and require significant re-work for macros or scripts to work right.  This was the case for earlier versions of Microsoft Access.  Excel 2007 takes the prize in Office 2007 Pro.  It's as though Microsoft marketing (and not engineering) designed it specifically for beginners.  While this might seem like a good way to capture greater market share, it appears to have been conducted at the expense of intermediate and advanced Excel and Office users.In most companies, the top 5% of Excel power users perform the majority of data analytics and produce over 90% of the pivot tables and advanced workbooks for everything from marketing database analytics to sales compensation planning and forecasting.  It is this group of users that in my view should keep Excel 2003 and avoid Excel 2007.  At a minimum, former Excel 2003 users will have to re-learn a hideous new menu system just to begin with.  I went so far as to purchase a third-party tool that tries to re-create the Office 2003 menu look and feel.  Even the most basic Excel 2007 features seem buggy.  If I try to edit a text box, the cursor moves backwards when I scroll forward!  It's so bad, I find myself editing in notepad and then pasting back into the text boxes.The most advanced Excel users rely upon pivot tables a great deal.  This is one area that is infuriatingly poorly designed in Excel 2007, and there are significant compatibility issues with earlier Excel versions. There are a few benefits to Excel with regard to number of columns and record/row size, still in earlier versions you could always reference an external text source to overcome the record limitation.  I'm not a big fan of litigation but I'd sign on to a class action if I receive an invitation.  My advice is to hang on to Excel 2003 until Microsoft engineers can wrest back product control from the dolts in their marketing group.  Also, OpenOffice.org 3.0 Calc is a nice product.  It has some pivot table features (not as good as Excel 2003) but good enough for the average user.  My only sense of satisfaction is that I'm sure the top 5% of Excel power users at Microsoft also despise this latest release if they are being forced to use it under CDOE policy.  I would bet that they are using Excel 2003 instead of this dumbed-down monstrosity if at all possible.  If you are in business and have a tough competitor with a really smart analytics or accounting team, bribe their IT Director to upgrade to Office 2007 with Excel.</review>

<review id="6113">We had a cat that was a very good cat until the kids came along.  She hated the kids.  Everywhere the kids were, she'd follow and urinate.  If the baby was in the crib, she'd urinate in the crib.  If the baby was on the comforter, she'd urinate on the comforter.  It got to the point that we were prisoners in our own home.  Everything the baby lay on could never be left out.  We had to make sure all blankets and cribs and anything the baby touched were locked in a room away from the cat.  When my daughter came along, the cat went to war.

<review id="6116">I have owned ipods since they were first released and have upgraded to newer versions about 5 times. Although i have to admit that the UI (User interface) on the itouch/iphone is the most amazing in every portable mp3 device or phone ever built, apple has made some changes to the hardware on the itouch that have completely disappointed me to a point where I sold my 32Gb itouch and bought a 120Gb ipod classic instead.  Apple decided to change the connector inside the device by removing the pin that allows firewire functionality, this means that with many third party peripherals and accessories you won't be able to charge your itouch as it plays.  Another example, my car came with a built-in ipod interface which works great with any other ipod models except for the itouch, with the ipod video i owned before, it used to play AND charge through the interface, it worked perfectly, I never had to take the ipod out of my car for over a year, it was always charged!!!  Then, with the itouch, not only it didn't charge, but it also froze my car stereo and would make the itouch soft reset itself.  It was a true pain in the a@@.  I spoke with several 2nd and 3rd tier tech guys from ipod support and they were the ones that explained what had been removed in the itouch, they also explained that it was NOT a software issue, it is caused by the hardware change that apple decided to make.  Bad mistake!!  I am glad the video/classic ipod i bought again works fine.  Too bad because i did like the user interface on the itouch.  One more thing, I have an ipod interface with a Yamaha receiver, the interface works great with any ipods except for the itouch.</review>

<review id="6118">BEWARE! THIS IS NOT YOUR GRANDMA'S 1950 KITCHENAID MIXER (HERS IS PROBABLY STILL WORKING)! It is a badly-engineered, expensive, appliance nightmare.I had a 5-quart KitchenAid mixer for many years, but since that one was almost worn out, and I really wanted a larger capacity machine, I "upgraded" to the 6-quart model.BIG MISTAKE!! This machine does NOT have enough power for serious bakers. It literally "smoked" the motor on the first try - and I was following all the instructions to the letter (i.e., only use the dough hook on speed 2, etc.) I'm not stupid. I even used a bread recipe out of the KitchenAid cookbook!So I received a replacement from KitchenAid. (Good news if you do buy one - they will send you a replacement - but it makes you wonder why their return system works so well.. maybe because they have to replace these machines all the time??)The new mixer has not been any better - while it doesn't exactly "smoke" (yet), it overheats and locks up. And it drips BLACK OIL out of the hole where the attachments go in. Yummy! Black oil in your bread dough. I spend more time wiping and cleaning it than anything else, and what SHOULD be a relaxing pasttime (baking), instead becomes a stressful, frustrating nightmare trying to use this badly designed, underpowered machine.OK, if you are ONLY going to make fluffy cakes and pies, the KitchenAid is probably fine for you. On the other hand, if you want to make bread, brownies or other thicker-dough recipes, forget it. Go with a different brand and get at least an 800 or 1000 watt machine.Because of my terrible experience with this mixer, I will NEVER buy another KitchenAid product EVER.</review>

<review id="6119">My husband and I own more kitchen appliances than most people because we are avid bakers and cooks, and we are picky - we'll pay whatever price we need to in order to buy quality.  This unit is NOT quality.  The so-called non-stick surface DOES stick, it is impossible to clean since you cannot do more than just "wipe" the surface clean, which is unsanitary to say the least and does not adequately clean in between the grooves.  That means you have to spend much more time cleaning this unit entirely by hand than you should have to.  (I suggest you buy a unit that diassambles for cleaning).  Also, although the many temperature settings seem like a good idea, the quality of the waffles vary greatly depending upon what batter you use and which temperature you select, so you end up with too many variables for consistently great waflles unless you only use one setting and one type of batter for the rest of the life of this unit.  I absolutely would not buy this or give it as a gift.  (We received ours as a wedding gift and it is now in the trash)</review>

Couldn't bring up OneCare at all.  Logged onto Microsoft's website to troubleshoot. Among all the "cures" I was advised to try the last was to uninstall and then reinstall.  Uninstalled as instructed and when I went to download it was asked to pay for it again.  Duh!  When I called Microsoft the tech said in very nice tones, "Toughh"  I've downloaded Free Avast and it works just fine.  That tore it with Microsoft for me.  Next computer:  Probably Apple.</review>

<review id="6126">This junk broke within months of getting it.  I was so careful with this camera, but it just stopped working.  The joystick part broke and now I can not change modes or play back video clips.Just wanted to add that Aiptek gives you the run around and doesn't seem to want to honor the warranty.   When called they said we need a return number.  They sent us an email to replay to for the number.  They never responded back with the number.  When/if we ever get the number to return the camera we pay to ship the camera to them.  They won't send a replacement for 5 weeks after they receive my camera.</review>

<review id="6128">Do NOT buy this food processor if you are hoping for a cheap way of chopping your onions and veggies! it completely destroys them- as in, grinds them into mush- no matter how short of a time you try to chop them in. In fact, they should just replace the "chop" button with the word "mush". It would be more honest frankly. If you only want to use this to make salad dressings and the like, you may be ok- but then again, why not just save yourself some money and use a whisk?</review>

<review id="6129">I have owned these cat feeders for several months, so this review is from a seasoned owner.  My two cats, when left to their own devices, will overeat, and put on too much weight.  So, I was hoping these pet feeders would provide good portion control without me having to be around all the time.Setup:  Several other reviews say that the setup is difficult and unintuitive; I completely agree.  The secondary instruction "cheat sheet" linked to elsewhere was a big help, and once I had that, programming was not too hard.Operation:  The devices run for a long time on their D cell batteries.  Operation was as advertised, and the devices dispensed the food reliably.  One complaint; when you have to replace the batteries, the unit has to be reprogrammed from scratch.  However this happens once every few months, so it's not that big of a deal.This brings me to the Achilie's heel of these units: within one month, my cats had both learned how to defeat them.The cats quickly figured out that if they stuck their paw all the way up the chute and poke around, that it would dislodge a pellet of food.  Granted, just one pellet, but being cats, they have little else to do all day, and can repeat this as necessary.Ultimately, the cats ended up getting to eat as much as they wanted anyway.  Might as well have just left big bowls of food out for them.</review>

<review id="6130">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)      I usually LOVE 2 disc special editions.  Typically, they have deleted or extended scenes, director commentary, and interviews with the actors.This has NONE of those!  The 2nd disc is a waste!  No actor interviews, no commentary...all it has is a silly interview with the composer, and some fake "Gothom Tonight" shows.Seriously, Heath Ledger gives one of the best villain performances of all times, and there isnt one interview?!?!?  Nothing at all.  You'd never even realize he was in the movie if you only saw the "Bonus Disc"Save $10 and just get the single disc...cuz the 2nd disc is nothing more than a coaster.Or, go get Iron Man or Tropic Thunder, which actually had GREAT 2nd discs.</review>

<review id="6132">The top hinge on my first Breville kettle broke within 8 months. The (warranty) replacement kettle Breville sent started leaking around the water window within 18 months.

<review id="6134">I purchased this product from the local store to replace an old Linksys router that broke. It has been a month of trying to make this garbage work with all the computers and laptops at home and I am still having all kinds of problems. It works fine with the desktop computer that it is connected to but it just does not work any way with any of the laptops. I tried calling Linksys and the tech pretty much said that bsaed on the information I gave him it does not seem likely that it will work with both laptops, maybe with one of them at a time. I asked him to walk me through the steps of verifying the set up and he wouldn't do it unless I paid him $10 and let him log into my machine remotely which I could not do as it had sensitive work information. He HUNG UP!!! I called a local IT person who came to my house and was also unsuccessful in setting it up to work with both laptops. Bottom line, save yourself the trouble and buy something that is actually compatible with more than one computer, that is unless you are only setting up one connection.</review>

<review id="6136">This product had the best reviews but the performance was not at all verygood. I found it very awkward to roll the litter box. You still have tobend down and tip the litter box all the way over to get the clumpsinto the pull out tray. And that's the clumps that aren't stuck in thelitter filter piece, which gets easily clogged and is not reallysomething I want to deal with cleaning. Besides not all clumps goinginto the tray, lots of unused litter ended up in the tray as well.Also, I bought the 'regular' size one and the filter piece goes almostright in the middle of the space so the usable cat space was verysmall. Needless to say I returned the litter box and was so glad tohave the old fashioned scoop litter box.</review>

<review id="6137">This is my second Sony camcorder. The first bought back in 2000 was a HI-8 digital tape camcorder. That was a good camera, quality pictures, decent battery life, lots of features...etc., etc. But I digress, I recently began seeing these small pocket size cameras at school functions and was really jealous because mine was big and heavy.  After much research I decided to go with this DVD Hybrid camera.  I wanted this camera for ease of playback (DVD's) and ease of uploading video to laptop for sending video to relatives out of state.  For those reasons the camera was good however the picture quality was horrible unless it was high noon with full sun. Indoors with regular room light images were dark and out of focus, really? Strike one. Then (I guess I didn't research enough) the DVD's for this are only 30 minutes at standard quality, and 20 minutes for high quality, really?  20 or 30 mins. and I have to get a new disc and then carry around extras? Strike two. The flash card is nice to record to but even that with no memory issues that still has poor video quality.  You can read all reviews and research but sometimes you really can't tell until you get it out of the box. The touchscreen was nice but having it open and using it sucked the battery dry.  The memory card is an extra [...] bucks at Walmart for the 4 GB. Oh, I forgot to mention the steady shot is horrible, the images were very shaky, and that was with minimal movement.  I also saw they just released a newer version of this camera the 650, don't know about that but this 610 is only 1 year old but that's electronics.</review>

<review id="6138">I returned the unit because it gave readings that were 20-25 points low, as compared to the cuff at the drugstore.</review>

<review id="6139">In the pseudo-documentary, 'The Secret' we are told that you can possess anything you want- money, fame, women, good health- all through the power of positive-thinking. If you're fat, ugly, or have a fatal disease it's your own stupid fault for not thinking more positively. Life isn't about working hard, bettering society, or helping your fellow man. It's all about fulfilling your every selfish desire.  Greed and gluttony are the keys to happiness. Now that the secret is out, I  wonder what will become of our society. Will we transform our world into a land of rainbows where rivers flow with chocolate and children in Iraq laugh and dance and play with gumdrop smiles? Or with everyone trying to create their own idyllic world will this create a destructive imbalance in the universe that will unravel the very fabrics of time and space foretold erroneously by Al Gore as being caused by global warming? Indeed there really is a secret, but sadly it is not revealed anywhere in this documentary. But being the nice guy that I am, i will reveal it to you now, and I won't even charge you 20 bucks for it: If you really want to make a ton of money, make a documentary telling lazy gullible idiots exactly what they want to hear. Then write a companion book and have it endorsed by a celebrity who is descending slowly into utter madness such as Oprah or Larry King. It's really that simple folks.</review>

<review id="6140">This review is from: Transformers (Video On Demand)      In response to the guy who said not to post technical complaints in the movie review section I say: show me where I can make my complaint with this garbage player as easily and as visibly as I can here.Normally I love Amazon.  As a matter of fact, I did most of my Christmas shopping here.  As an online store, they are tough to beat.This player, however has just taken the top spot on my "worst video players ever" list.  It has frequently locked up my computer so badly that I couldn't even bring up the task manager to close the application.Even when I was able to view my movies it would take about 30 seconds for it to register that I wanted to pause playback.In short:Worst Media Player EVER!</review>

<review id="6141">My 8 year old cat suffered what my vet called 'a rare allergic reaction' to this product.  The vet also said 'too bad, too, as it is the best product of its kind on the market'.Within 24 hours of its application, my cat had bald burned spot about the size of two quarters.  The skin looks like a chemical burn - irritated, pink and bit gooey.  The vet said to apply OTC topical hydrocortisone cream and that it is possible the fur will not grow back in the affected area.  In any case,  the cat is on the mend. I called the toll free number on the Frontline box and spoke with a vet tech.  He documented the cat's reaction and medical condition.  He also said to send the remaining product back to Frontline for a full refund, which was a nice surprise.  I am not saying not to use this product, just keep an eye on your pet if you do.</review>

According to the letter from the IRS all the numbers input matched up, but the computation by turbo tax was way off mark... Have used this program for over 10 years, but never again.

<review id="6146">My wife and I experimented around with diapers with both of our two daughters.  Our first daughter got a rash on her bottom when she wore this brand.  We stopped using Luvs and switched to Pampers.  Now we have a second infant.  She started getting a rash after someone gave us a box of Luvs.  We switched back to Pampers and the rash went away.  My mother bought us some Luvs when she came to visit.  We started using them, and what do you know, she has a rash again.  In short, these diapers give our daughters a rash.  It probably doesn't happen for all babies, but keep the possibility in mind.  We have found Pampers to be worth the extra money - they hold more, break less easily, and don't leave rashes.</review>

<review id="6148">I researched and had read the reviews and felt that I was purchasing a good product.... I was VERY disappointed. I even looked at the video that was online and the images...there is no way they used this same camera. I am very experienced in capturing video and images and making multimedia products, so it is not like I am an amateur at this. I also have an Aiptek camera which I purchased over a year ago for capturing video and images in classrooms and for products that don't require the "high-end" production cameras. The Aiptek cost about half the price of this product and takes VERY good video and high quality images many times over! I was expecting better, not professional quality, I have another digital video camera for that, but better than what I got. The Sanyo took very and I do underscore VERY poor quality, pixelated video and the images were more like 1 MP images, no where near the 9 MP that this product says. I am returning this product and purchasing a newer Aiptek camera.</review>

<review id="6150">I personally did not like this movie at all, but my boyfriend loved it and I know a ton of people love it so much, that it just won many awards at the People Choice Awards 2009, and one of them including "best movie".  I watched about an hour of it and couldn't watch it anymore cause I didn't like it and didn't seem interesting.  A lot of parts in it you can tell are super fake.  However, Heath Ledger did an amazing job in this movie.  That is the only thing I like about this movie.  Sorry.  From me to you, I would probably get it since most people love the movie, but I just didn't like it for some reason.  And I love most movies like this, yet I never have liked ANY batman movies ever.  You make the decision. If you like prior batmans, then you will like it, but if not, then dont waste your time, unless you want to see how Heath Ledger plays an absolutely crazy part in it.</review>

<review id="6151">I have the CH Yoke and Pedals. The yoke has a problem with its plastic shaft that is controlled by springs. It's almost impossible to obtain the neutral point. In fact the "pull-push" friction caused by the plastic-over-plastic (plastic shaft sliding in plastic housing) doesn't give any precision during the flight simulation. I am sure that for that price a better design should be a must. I am a General Aviation pilot and when practicing IFR procedures requiring precision in terms of altitude I feel really frustrated and my first impression is to deal with a toy.</review>

<review id="6152">I've read all the reviews here and it's fine that "Captain Justice" has the cash to spend on costly half season sets that don't have what Ron Moore said they would. It's also fine that some of us aren't happy with that. Some of us would prefer something more affordable, complete, and closer to what Moore said it would be. The "Captain" would have you believe that there's no problem with Universal trying to milk the fans of their hard earned cash. I don't agree. I'd prefer to be able to purchase complete seasons with what Moore said would be on them. I also don't agree with the claims that by not buying this we are killing the series so we should just buy it and shut up. It's sad that some fans think that approach is the best way to deal with other fans. It's even sadder that we've been deprived of what Moore said would be on these DVDs and that some people are perfectly happy about that.</review>

<review id="6153">I like the capacity and speed of this thing, but it comes with software that is nearly impossible to get rid of. Granted, it facilitates some of the processes, but it is not needed. I don't need to be leaving this software all over every machine this thing gets stuck into. There is no uninstall, and even if I keep deleting it from the disk, it gets re-installed when I put it in any machine it has been in before. There should be a warning on the package that this thing is going to leave software all over all your computers. If I had know that, I would never have purchased it. I will definitely not purchase SanDisk again, even though I like their CF cards for my cameras.</review>

<review id="6155">I was disappointed to find that I could still wring out juice from the overly wet pulp when it was done.  I thought I did my research but found a lower price juicer (different brand) to be better.  I sent this one back.  I think the screen holes that the juice is supposed to go through are too small.  I tried different speed settings when juicing and that didn't make a difference.  Would not recommend this product.</review>

<review id="6156">In the past years, I have had several issues with TT.  If I itemized my deductions but took the standard deduction because it was larger, TT would not carry the relevant deductions for long term care to my Indiana tax return where they were still valid.  I informed TT of this issue for several years and they still haven't corrected it.  I also had another major problem with the Indiana return last year.  The e-filed form did not agree with the printed form.  I could not understand why I owed money when my printed form clearly showed a refund.  It turns out that the e-file did not carry over one line item.  As a result, I had to do an amended return.  Imagine how much fun I had on the phone trying to convince hard headed programmers that their program was wrong.  I finally got them to agree it was their error and not mine.Those critical errors plus the fact that TT is now charging for each use of their program is causing me to switch to HR Block.  I haven't used HR Block before but I have read the ratings in the past and they always appear to be similar to TT.  So good bye TT after 12 years.  I hope you make lots of money from those who are not smart enough to switch.</review>

It is just too dark and the colors are frequently very wrong.  I saw the movie twice in the theater and it looked great.  I only wish I had rented the DVD before buying. Could this be a deliberate push for consumers to move to HD media, or could they really be this incompetent?  Who the hell wants to adjust their TV to watch a movie and adjust it back when they're done?!  Grrr...</review>

<review id="6158">I have to admit, I didn't enjoy Twilight as much as those around me did, but I trudged through it. Then came New Moon and I thought that it wasn't so bad. And then came Eclipse and I realize I should have gone with my gut...these books are all hype and no substance. The characters are so far removed from actual people you would meet and interact with, that you can't help but cringe as you read their reactions to the things happening to them.I think Bella is the most annoying, whiny, self obsessed, hypocrtical main character I have had the pleasure of encountering. What is it that everyone sees in her? She is moody, has no hobbies, is plain and pretty much a bore. Then on top of all that she's a klutz and can't stand the sight of blood. How does she think she will manage being a vampire??? All for love...no, not for love, but because she does not want to age.I went into this book with an open mind, hoping things would be tied into a nice bow and we'd get some answers and the characters would learn some life lessons. They didn't grow and they didn't seem to learn a thing. Let's see what I learned...that it's ok to hurt those around you because you love them. It's ok to be a brat because your hearts in the right place. It's ok to say no to a great college because the love of your life wants to pay for it. It's ok to be a typical weak female, because you will be rescued by not one, but two hot guys. I could go on, but I won't.I have to wonder what book people are reading that have given this one 5 stars...surely they must be under a vamp's spell.</review>

<review id="6160">I really wanted to enjoy this series but the writing did me in. My daughters both loved the series, although the second book was their least favorite. As for my opinion, in all the books I found the writing to be amateurish and the emotions of the characters to be extremely dramatic and unrealistic. In addition, the repetitious description of "eye rolling", sighing", "teeth grinding", "trembling" and so many other body movements that make up the majority of the writing made ME grind my teeth every time the author repeated them. The writing is made up of character conversation, character thought and body language for the most part...there is little description of the surroundings or any real flow of the characters getting from one place to another. If something is said once, it is said a dozen times. I also found the story line of undying dramatic love to be way over the top...to the point of stalking. There are a lot of creepy parts to this book. Why would a 117 year old man at heart (Edwards real age) be so enamored with a 17 year old whiny klutz like Bella? Thats just wrong! And they are always smelling each other. And he has to try to contol himself so he won't drain Bella of all her blood (which she seems to be flattered about) because she has special blood that smells the best to vampires. It took me well over two weeks to read each book and I can polish off a good book in a night. The only reason I continued to read this series is because my daughters wanted me to read them and enjoy them as much as they did...and I REALLY TRIED!! You'd be better off seeing the movie than reading the book. It was wonderful...and the writing was GREAT.</review>

<review id="6163">This is not an effective body trimmer or shaver. It is cheaply made. It doesn't cut cleanly and even at its closest setting leaves stubble you (and your partner) will feel. I threw mine away after using it for a few months.</review>

<review id="6166">1) If you love coffee, don't buy a glass caraffe that will burn the bottom after the coffee sits for about 15 minutes; opt instead for a thermal insulated caraffe option.2) If you like to make a full pot, this coffee maker only holds enough coffee to brew 1Tbsp per cup.  If you liked stronger coffee or brew with the method recommended by many gourmet brands, you will not be able to fit enough coffee in the machine to make a full pot to your desired strength.Cuisinart is a great brand, and I love most of their appliances; I even like the Burr Grinder that I own.  They haven't taken on the coffee space as experts with this machine.</review>

The uplink port doesn't work any more. I switched in Apple's Airport Express and that worked fine.If you buy one of these, and they *are* relatively cheap, KEEP THE RECEIPT! You won't be able to get service without it.Also note that their service is in India and weren't very helpful (although they tried to be) when I called asking about WPA.You get what you pay for, I guess.

<review id="6168">I have been gaming for a long time now, and this by far is the worst joystick i have ever used.  The force feedback on this joystick is nothing.  If you are thinking of getting this, DON'T!!! When i read the reviews, i thought these people knew what they were talking about.  They obviosly didn't.  When i loaded the software into my computer, (I'm running off of vista) and tested it out, i could barely feel anything.  I used to have a Microsoft Sidewinder with force feedback, and that was amazing.  It was the best joystick i ever had.  The pro force was not well made.  when i pluged the powerpack in, it would not stay in the outlet because it was so loose.  And when i pluged the other end into the joystick, it kept falling out too.  The reciever was too big.  The sensitvity was way too high.  There was no dead zone at all.  And when i tried to calibrate it, it didn't do anything.  So to sum this all up, Quality: 1Durability: 2Ease of use: 2Force feedback resistence: 0I would not recamend this product to anyone.</review>

Then, when it finally died, I purchased this CHI, having heard it's really great. Uhm, no. It doesn't EVER get my hair fully straight (it is naturally curly but not coarse). I hate that it doesn't have temp control - it never seems to get hot enough. I have to go over my hair at least 3 times just to get it even close to straight, but it's NEVER super-flat or "Jennifer Aniston" straight like an earlier review mentioned. I'm super disappointed in this CHI and wish I hadn't thrown away the box so I could return it. Sigh. Waste of $100 in my opinion.</review>

<review id="6173">I have a doberman pinscher and she hates getting her nails cut and I hate cutting them because of her black nails and not being able to see her quick.  So, I thought that this handy tool would be perfect for her and me.  I bought it at Bed Bath & Beyond.  Yes, it is sold in stores unlike what the commercial says and the box says.  Once I got it home, I popped in some fresh batteries, turned it on and started on nail #1.  But to my amazement, the filer stopped the moment I put my dogs nail to the file.  OK, operator error, maybe I was pushing too hard and wasn't giving the tool it's fair share so I decided to try again but more gently.  But once again, I was unsuccessful.  The motor in this thing is so weak that I literally had to barely touch my dogs' nail on the file for it to even continue to rotate.  Now, because I have a big dog I cannot say to the small dog owners but for any dog bigger than a cocker spaniel, this thing isn't worth the plastic it is made in.  You would probably be better off just getting a manual file and doing the work yourself.  It took me about 30 minutes to file all my dogs nails except for 3 because she couldn't take it anymore.  Nice idea, bad execution!</review>

<review id="6174">I used K9 Advantix because I was bringing my dog with me on vacation into tick-infested woods.  I used three-quarters of the 20 lb. dose on my 13 lb. poodle.  Approx. 12 hours after application, she began to have terrible neurological symptoms, running around and crying, jerking and jumping.  Her nose became very hot and her breathing became rapid and shallow.  We were up all night.  By the time I got instructions over the telephone to wash it off with liquid dish detergent, it had been 24 hours.  She survived, but the cartilage in her throat has been damaged and her bark is permanently changed.  If you are using this product for the first time, PLEASE use only half the recommended dose and standby with the liquid dish detergent.  If your dog can stand it, you can apply the rest two days later.  The only antidote for permethrin poisoning is to wash it off with liquid dish detergent within the first 24 hours!  Many dogs have been injured, and deaths have been attributed to K9 Advantix.  [...].</review>

<review id="6175">I just now updated my Flip video software and the update DELETED ALL VIDEOS on the Flip (there were close to 40). I called customer service and they said "Oh, yeah, we're having that happen sometimes and we're working on it. Sorry."I was outraged that there was no mention of the simple and obvious way to prevent this (i.e., just don't upgrade unless you've already saved everything on your Flip) on their website. I said this to the customer support person, but I don't think they have any plans to implement this. Stinks for me, and it may stink for you. Beware.</review>

<review id="6177">This review is from: Gone With The Wind (Limited Edition Deluxe Box Set) (DVD)      To All Prospective GWTW Afficionados....DO NOT BUY THIS BOXED SET at the outrageous $71+ price.  The glossy prints are poor quality...the other 'STUFF' included is just 'STUFF' and the really BAD THING....is that there is only 1 DVD.  All the other releases currently (the more upscale and remastered ones) include 4 YES THAT IS FOUR DVD's which have information on interviews, making of the film, screen tests...etc.  But this FANCY BOXED SET....has only one....Upon opening it, we immediately closed it and sent it back...and ordered the 4 DVD set at $27.94.  So...save yourself some trouble and stick with the ORDINARY and AVOID the 'EXTRA-Ordinary'...Gladys C.</review>

<review id="6178">This router has caused me much grief.  It is supposed to interoperate with older G and B wireless adapters, but it doesn't.I have 3 machines in my house, all wireless.  One desktop and two laptops.  Only the newer Dell laptop works with this router.  In fact "works" is really stretching it.After over an hour on the phone with tech support, the problem he claimed would be fixed was not.  The router drops connections regularly on the new Dell and does not connect at all with the other 2 machines.In a final attempt to get the thing to work, I updated the firmware to version 1.20 from the dlink website, only to find out that it made the situation worse AND when I went back to the website to look again, the 1.20 firmware had been pulled and was no longer available. Dlink knows they have a problem interoperating with older wireless adapters, and are trying to fix the situation.So, bottom line is:  don't waste your time!  It *may* work for you, but this was a disaster and a waste for me.  Buyer beware.Avoid this product.</review>

<review id="6180">This pet feeder is difficult to program.  It took me about twenty-five tries and talking to Customer Service to get it right.  The problem is that you only have about 10 seconds to spend on each step, and if you have to stop and read the directions, the machine goes back to the default setting without you knowing.  Also the portion control is not guaranteed as they warn in the instructions.  But it seems to me to be off more than it should.  The fourth cup setting is more like a third to a half, and it does not come out the same amount each time.</review>

<review id="6184">I purchased this Oral-B Precision Clean 4 pack replacement head, I highly doubt if this is original Oral-B product.

I am on the 3rd brush head now (out of the 4 pack I bought), they all broke the same way. I remembered I bought the 2 or 3 pack replacement brush head from Target before, they worked exactly like the original, but expensive.

<review id="6185">This is the third one that i have gotten, each time from a different supplier, i really like the cordless function but even that can get bothersom. For example, if your sitting on the runway for awhile, or holding a straight and level flight pattern, and you dont touch it for a certain amount of time, it goes into "stand-by" or something, which can get very annoying when you go to bank left and it doesnt respond, so you have to start pushing buttons or something.As well as, all 3 that i have used, have lost calibration in one or two areas, each time it was when i would put the stick in the uppper-left of lower-right corners, it wouldnt move, its a worthless stick from what i have noticed and i would never use it again, ill stick with my sidewinder</review>

<review id="6186">... I understand Bill is an outspoken Atheist in a culture where it is highly frowned upon to be Atheist. I think many of the questions and points he raises in this documentary are important... Religion can be a poison, religion can empower a select few who use it to manipulate, in the name of religion wars have been waged... I understand how to Bill and to other Atheist and Agnostics all religious figures could be grouped togeather, but my understanding and acceptance of Bill's ideas really stops there. I am a Christian and if we met I certainly wouldn't push my views in your face. While I don't have any miracles to tell you about, I can tell you about the things my Church is doing in our community to help single mothers, to build homes for the homeless and to provide food for the hungry. I can tell you that at these events our beliefs aren't pushed on anyone we help. I can you that if you were to pick up a Christian Bible and read the story of Jesus found in the gospels in the New Testament that you would discover a religious figure with some very unique attributes. For example, unlike Buddha or Mohammad, or well any other religious figure we find someone claiming to actually be God incarnate into man and we find that this person didn't like religion much either. In fact the religious leaders of his time hated him. Jesus's message wasn't one of hate it was a message of love. I know that sounds incredibly simple and I'm not trying to insult anyone. I understand if you have a real problem with that from every logical stand point, I would too (I'm an Engineer and a rather logical thinker)... All I can tell you is that my beliefs and non-denominational church give me a deep sense of peace and happiness that it would be impossible to describe. My social group and closest circle of friends consist of people with varied religious views, so there is no criteria for cult-like activity. You are free to believe all my experiences are chemical reactions. I think you're wrong, we could go round and round, let's not. The fact is there are many, many churches that are not the extreme organizations you see here that are a positive force in the world. Has religion been twisted and corrupted and used for a great deal of pain in this world, the answer is YES. Is 'religion' really the path to God? The answer the No. At it's best religion provides a means for like believers to join togeather and accomplish positive things in society and the world in general. At it's worst it's a destructive and negative force. We live in a imperfect world, trying to poke fun at region and only point out it's flaws comes across more than a bit pretentious. Collectively it's religion that moves this world. In fact if you really think about the force of religion, The Agnostic and Athesit point of view is one of pretension and retreat. Just because there is no clear answer doesn't mean it's all wrong. The truth I've found is very simple, God doesn't need religion to reach people and faith in God is a very personal thing that must be detached from religion. Inside each person there is a longing to connect with God. The more logical minded and gifted often react to this with a resentment and 'prove you're real' attitude. But if you stop and think about it, if there is an all knowing God in the Christian sense he's certainly big enough to take your cursing at him and fist waving hatred for him (which actually manifest itself in hatred for believers) He's capable of taking all of that from you ever day of your life then at the very end still loving you... After all, if such a God exist then it would have to understand your logical needs. So how does an Agnostic find this God? I think the answer is in the Bible, Matthew 7:7-8 - Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. (NIV). The problem the agnostic and atheist face is getting past their hate for Christians and God and being open minded enough to accept that something just might be there... Here's a final thought: If this was a God that created everything according to Christian ideology, wouldn't everything we know about Science, Math, Physics, the known Universe seem incredibly small and petty? Would it really be possible to connect with such a being in terms of Science, Math, Physics, et al. that we as humans have come to understand at this point in our growth? Perhaps, but isn't it more likely that everything we have would be so primitive in comparison that we really couldn't qualify such a beings existence. Some of our brightest physicist believe theories of multiple dimensions, who's to say they are wrong and that this God lives in ours... Isn't plausible there are things we just haven't figured out yet and that the things we can explain (e.g. chemical reactions in the brain that provide explanation for religious experience) are the tip of the ice berg and that there is something much more going on that we simply don't have the science to explain...</review>

<review id="6188">I bought this router about 6 months ago, and it randomly started not working recently.  Once I figured out that the problem was the router and not the internet company, I called Linksys.  They had me do troubleshooting steps, and the person who I talked to in India had me repeat the same steps about five times before telling me to update the software.  That also did not work, so I called back and they told me I could get a replacement.  When I went online to order the replacement, I was told that I had been given an invalid replacement number.  I called back, and the person told me that I had to talk to someone else, and basically I've already spent about 4 hours of my life on this problem.  It still has not been resolved, and even once they send the router, it will take days before I receive the unit.  AND I'll have to pay to send the defective one in.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I'm done with Linksys just after this.</review>

<review id="6189">I purchased this keyboard well over a year ago and i'm already on my second one. The first was replaced by logitech because of "faulty clearcoat" on the paint, which came off within 1 month of acquiring this keyboard.

<review id="6194">I normally don't post reviews, but felt I owed it to the girl gamer community :)This mouse is way too big for my hand and I am tall and don't have the smallest hands. SO if you are a guy and your hands are on the small side, you may want to stray from this mouse as well. My thumb barely reaches the two side buttons (4 & 5) I found I had to turn my hand awkardly on the mouse to be able to hit them comfortably. Even the middle mouse button is a stretch, but is sensitive enough its a little less cumbersome.Its a shame because I really like the response time of the mouse and I like a heavier mouse and it moves really smooth for being heavier. SO I gave this one to my husband and went back to my logitek.So if you have exceptionally large hands this may be the mouse for you :)</review>

<review id="6195">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      because I've made up my mind and I am not crazy about the Twilight series.  Other reviewers mentioned "Timewasting" and "Sad characters" and they were spot on.  I love Jacob.He was the best part of the book along with the Volturi.  He is a better choice than Edward, but then again, Edward and Jacob are too good for Bella.  Bella is weak and pathetic,selfish, and she really bugs. I wish she was a more confident character. Then I could like her and care what will happen to her in Eclipse.  She is just so annoying begging to made a vampire like it's candy or something.  Ugh, blech!  Edward and Jacob deserve to fight over a better girl.</review>

<review id="6196">The Twilight series was recommended to me by the person who draws my blood (seriously). I am &lt;ahem> slightly older than the intended YA audience. I finished the entire series over a weekend. I have recommended it, wholeheartedly, to many people... with a caveat. Usually I say something like, "The first three books are wonderful.. um.. the fourth.... well... she takes a turn for the weird."[...]I don't see this book as promoting teen pregnancy and not going to college. [...] Yes, many girls/boys overromanticize and overhormonize first love and believe it's the be all end all. Chances are they were like that before they read this book and the book didn't cause their desire to have kids immediately, skip college etc. My problem is the sour disappointment of a fan not a feminist (and I am staunchly a feminist). Bella... oh Bella... in the first three books you mirrored my inner nerd. You felt out of place, you didn't understand your own self worth -- my former high school self understood you well. [...]Then Book 4.. &lt;sigh> the Bella I loved disappears figuratively and literally. The voice changes to Jacob (and he sounds more like an irritated "Logan/Wolverine" than a tragic teen werewolf) and you lose me there first. This was always your story. [...] I agree with previous readers that I would MUCH rather have seen the challenge your change would have brought to your human relationship dynamic.. but I am not the author. I found Renesmee a bland addition to a very interesting character family (oh god... and renesmee? UGH! how about elizabeth after edward's human mother????)I skipped over many pages when the other vampires showed up.. who cares? Ah well, it was a fun ride, but I would hesitate to recommend this final book.</review>

<review id="6197">While I moderately enjoyed Twilight, I hated New Moon.  A friend of mine told me that Eclipse was better so I read it.  It is better than New Moon, but not by much.  Once again, Bella is solely motivated by the fact that she wants Edward and treats everyone else like dirt because she's too obsessed with Edward and the Cullens and wanting to be a vampire.  It creeps Edward out at one point.  It has a slow plot and is pedantic.  If you want a good vampire novel, go read Anne Rice.</review>

<review id="6198">Worked good at first, except when other dogs or loud sounds were around.  It works off of a microphone, so when another dog barked anywhere near my dog, the thing went off.  so, we were constantly having to turn the thing on and off.  No big deal, still liked it.  however, within a month it just quit working.  Replaced the battery after going to 5 stores to find the right size, and $10 late, still nothing.  After doing more reading, I'm now going to buy the high-sound emitting one that works off of vibrations instead of a microphone.  I'm hoping this will be one we can keep on her even if we're not home.</review>

<review id="6201">Regardless of how this machine works, Cuisinart fraudulently calls it a 12 cup unit.  Buried in the instructions they say that their definition of a "cup" is five ounces.

<review id="6209">Got this yesterday at Circuit City--  Thought it was a good deal at $50 compared to the Linksys at $120.  Excited to get it home, and improve speed on network, (especially wireless to PS3) I plugged in the CD and it immediately took down my network adapters.  Could not get it back.  (I'm not an IT guy, but they were completely gone.)  Intel's software couldn't find them, Windows couldn't find it.  Ended up re-imaging hard drive. After 3 hours of work to try to set it up, I finally had everything going, Windows reinstalled, internet back up, etc.  Plug in D-Link router as I follow the instructions and get no lights.

<review id="6210">This thing installed OK per the brief cheat sheet included, but then when I tried to configure security I found that the instructions simply didn't work.  Not even close.  URLs listed in the docs resulted in DNS errors or 404s.  Called tech support once, navigated through the endless prompts and when I finally got dumped in the support queue, I was disconnected within a few seconds.  I foolishly tried again, navigated through all the junk again, and was *almost* in the queue when a recorded message announced that "we're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed.  Please check the number and try again."  There's merely indifferent customer service and merely mediocre documentation out there, and then there's Netgear.  What a joke.</review>

<review id="6211">This was the biggest waste of money!  I put this on my dog as soon as it came in.  The first time she barked I could tell it sprayed because she started to sniff in the air.  So I began to test her in the house by knocking on doors and such.  She continued the barking so I wanted to make sure the thing was working.  Sure enough it wasn't spraying. After replacing the battery,  I tried it again and it didn't phase her one bit.  The spray is just a fine mist.  Even when I tested it like they tell you to do it was so fine that I could hardly smell it.  I even adjusted the collar several times to make sure I had it on correctly thinking that would make a difference but it didn't.  So if you're looking for something to help control your dog's excessive barking, look somewhere else.  This is useless!</review>

<review id="6212">I purchased this camera because I was looking for something that was simple to use, with acceptable quality. This camera falls short, even at the price. After all, you can get a "real" video camera with LOTS of features for about $80 more.Problem 1: The software that came with it was not compatible with either my Windows XP or Vista computers. In fact, the only thing that the "software" did was convert the video file to .avi format. Even this was the result of guesswork and not because the instructions or software were helpful. You HAVE to run the software, which then does not function, but, it converts your file while it is in the process of "concluding" that it will not work.BIG PROBLEM 2: In quiet settings, such as a room, the camera records its own internal storage sounds. Every few seconds you hear a strange and VERY noticeable beeping that lasts for about a second. This means that you are NOT going to be able to use this camera to make a decent video (unless there is enough ambient sound to drown out the odd little processor sound that is most likely a burst of data being recorded on the internal memory). So, you can't use it for work, or to make instructional videos, or to make any other videos where sound quality is even remotely a factor.Problem 3: There is a very REAL problem with the big red record button. It does not register properly when you push it. You can think you are recording because you are certain that you pushed it firmly, but, there the camera sits in "READY" mode, not in "REC" mode. The FLIP people have known about this switch problem for a LONG TIME, for it to still be a problem is inexcusable.My summary is that the camera is virtually useless. It does not automatically load videos on to YouTube, or any other website. The software is an artifact that does not work on the computer. Second,, the intolerable electronic noise that renders this video useless except as a toy. And, lastly, the ridiculously unresponsive RED BUTTON that controls the record and stop function.On the plus side, it is small, will store a bit of footage, and you can let your kids play with it because it's not like they'll ruin something valuable.</review>

<review id="6213">...okay that's a bit of an exaggeration.  My thick, course hair is much more managable (and silky smooth) after using the CHI.

<review id="6214">I read the reviews and thought I would throw the dice.  Well I lost.  I ordered the Breadman for my family that have all been recently put on a gluten free diet.  We made one loaf that came out delicious.  Two days later I poured in all the ingredients (which are extremely expensive) and turned the machine on.  The machine gave a few clicks and that was it.

After about a year of daily use (just ONCE daily, mind you), the mechanism that delivers water to the grounds started to clog, this even with repeated cleaning.  Every few pots or so, we would start the coffee maker and get nothing at all.  We would also often get overflowing coffee rather than being able to get a cup mid-brew as advertised.  We kept living this way for a while, but now it has stopped altogether.  I'm online today looking for a better coffee maker since we are now reduced to boiling water in the kettle and pouring it through the coffee grounds in the coffee maker.</review>

<review id="6218">I bought this for my 8-mo-old blue heeler/husky puppy, and she managed to pull the rope enough to break it within 2 days. She's a rough-and-tumbler to be sure, but they claimed it was indestructible. Hardly. Pity too, she'd almost learned how to use it.</review>

<review id="6220">The player is OK. What I dislike is that in order to charge from an electrical socket instead of thru a USB port, it is necessary to purchase a new charger, Why? Because Steve Jobs decided it wasn't enough to charge $199.00 for a 4th generatio nano. He wants you to pay another $29.00 for a charger that you had already purchased when you bought your first iPod. All he had to do was change the size of the charging port so the old one doesn't fit. Give me a break. It's one thing that the batteries wear out quick and you get charged $69 - $79 for a battery that costs about $2.00. But to screw around with long time customers and suck an extra $29.00 out of them, is a real rip off. I returned it. Screw Apple. I kept my old one and I changed the battery myself for $4.50. Steve Jobs, You got a lot of nerve,to say you are my friend.</review>

<review id="6222">As noted by others, the Pet Fountain can be silent if filled all the way up,  BUT, after about two days the pump got louder and louder.  A very poor quality water pump.  Also, the unit was missing the top cover when we received it, and after a couple calls to the manufacturer, they agreed to send the replacement part and then never did.  Finally, this is really a flimsy poorly made piece - you could do better buying a $5 water pump and making your own cat fountain.</review>

<review id="6223">Well, I have always liked Seagate drives because they are the last ones with a five year warranty. Problem is, you are going to NEED that warranty with this type of drive, mine failed in four weeks. There is no cooling system, just passive air vents, so the controller board overheats and the drive starts failing to communicate with the computer properly. Once it fails completely, kiss your data good by as Seagate will ONLY ship you a refurbished drive. They offer to "recover" your data, meaning they will take the time to copy it off the old drive, at a very high price. If you open the unit to get your data out before you ship it to them you have voided your warranty... Next time I'll get a LeCie with a one year warranty and better history and track record... This was my last Seagate. Too bad, I liked them.</review>

<review id="6224">Its price is good and the design is fine, but I didnt now that it needed power suply, so it's very uncomfortable to use it in many places as a portable disk. The size is another con, it's bigger than you think it is...</review>

<review id="6225">I bought this router last September and after multiple resets it totally died on me less than 6 months later.

I will never buy a D-Link product again. Bottom line...DO NOT BUY!</review>

<review id="6226">I gave up on Paperport and Scansoft/Nuance products after version 9 when it was still owned by Scansoft. Presto! PageManager is a much better program and it works with Windows including Vista and it works on MAC.Nothing has changed. The company is still floundering to provide something useful. Even the many magazine reviews I have read are not kind in their assessment. This is not a complicated or demanding task being asked to perform here. Scan my documents, all me to tweak them a bit, then save it to the folder of my choice. Why Nuance cannot provide a product that works after getting you to spend $100 I cannot figure out. I was lucky, I did not have to pay. I got a copy for free. I have worked with computers and networks and fixing them for years. With Vista this program was terrible. Even the most recent updates and help found on the website did not improve the situation. I tried and bought Presto! PageManager instead and have been very happy.</review>

<review id="6228">I also called the company and they said they could not help me except to offer advice on filling and cleaning. I have been filling and cleaning the unit the same way for 18 months and all of a sudden it started to leak. The woman said that many units were sent back because of leaks and they couldn't get them to leak. Seems like there are a lot of us out there that CAN get them to leak.We can't all be wrong. I told the woman there are a lot of comments on amazon about the leaking units. My cats love the filter and I want to use it because my cat once had a UTI before I started using it. I just don't want to buy another one after only  a year and a half. You would expect it to last longer.</review>

<review id="6229">I bought this to strap on mike bike and motorcycle.  It worked OK but after a couple of motorcycle rides the sound went out.  Too much vibration maybe?

Sorry Cuisinart, but I will go with a different brand this time around. :(</review>

<review id="6231">I have owned both a Microsoft Force Feedback and Force Feedback 2 joystick.  Both of which I love for the accuracy in which they faithfully translate my input to what I deem realistic movement of the flight controls.  This is to be expected by a digital joystick which all Force Feedback controllers are.I purchased the Flight Sim Yoke USB and Pedals because I realized when I decided to start actual flying lessons, my familiarity with the flight controls of a Cessna 172 wasn't instinctual.  This was not an issue until I was performing cross-wind landings and had to "think" about what I needed to do with my feet and hands to hit the touchdown marker aligned with the runway to "take out the crab".For the price of a single flight lesson, I purchased the CH Products yoke and pedals in order to practice my flight control inputs to the point they would become instinctual.  However since these devices are analog, they do not respond as well as the digital devices I was accustomed to.  I found myself having to increase the "dead-zones" as the yoke would not necessarily return to neutral and therefore I had to make more accentuated movements simply to control the plane.  This became a much less realistic experience than expected and thus a bit of a disappointment.In the end, I have gone back to using my Force Feedback 2 as it is a much more pleasurable experience and I will wait (and hope) that someone introduces a digital flight yoke and pedals so that realism and accuracy are both accomplished.  I would even pay 50%-75% more to have this feature as in the end it would have value as well as ROI when compared to the cost of actual flight time.</review>

<review id="6232">Very frustrated.  No matter what I try I can't get the Wireless networking to work.  The best I was able to achieve was sporadic connections; now I can't connect at all!  I can see more than one wireless connection, but I can't connect.  I even turned off all security on my router, but still can't connect.  The rj45 connection works fine; however I didn't buy this netbook for hardline connection.  I need to use it on the go and all around the house!  I will probably be returning this product.</review>

<review id="6233">I've had the product for almost 2 weeks now and used it maybe 6-7 times.  My problems have really been with the microphone and getting Dragon to pick up my voice at all.  It installed okay with only minor troubles, but then I could not pass the Volume Check because it kept saying the volume was too low.  I tried all their suggestions in the help sections with no success.  I finally solved this by messing with the checkboxes in the volume control section in my computer, realizing that Rear Mic was selected instead of just Mic.  It worked okay after that, with quite poor accuracy/speed at first but improved once I turned off extra features like using Dragon to move the mouse.Now, it's back to square one.  It worked fine two days ago, which was actually the first time that I thought it worked pretty well.  But today there's no recognition of my voice again.  My computer says the mic isn't working (hardware check in the control panel), but it works on another computer.  I'd call Nuance but 1) they're not open on weekends and 2) I hate to use up my one free session, but I guess I'll call on Monday.  I don't know whether to buy a new mic and try it out myself, but I don't want to waste the money if that's not the problem.</review>

<review id="6234">After reading most of the good reviews for this product, I couldn't wait to receive it once I placed my order...Once received I followed all the installation instruction but this router could not  find my ip address, submask, gateway default etc...as it was advertised it could...I've been using an older linksys router and wanted to get something new, but I think I will stick with it or at least with linksys...</review>

<review id="6235">In October of 2008 the Apple Company introduced yet another iPod into their ever expanding family.  This one is sthe fourth generation Nano. That's right folks, it is the fourth generation, which is a polite way of saying design, of an already established iPod music player. Why does the Apple Company feel that they needed to make a new Nano when, in fact, there are already three generations still out there?The newest iPod has many new features. A new feature called "Genius" has been added. This is actually a pretty cool development. The Genius sifts through your music library and finds music that would go great with music that you are already listening too to form a new playlist. Another cool feature is that it allows for you to not only play games but feel like you are a part of the game. The games responds to your movements.Coupled with these cool advances are some very arbitrary ones. Does it really matter that the newest Nano comes in nine different colors? Yes, it is cute, but the color doesn't stop the actual iPod from skipping or improve things that are wrong with it. Another feature on the Nano is that it allows you to view and go through your album artwork by pressing the center button. This seems interesting but how does this help you find the song you are looking for better than just going to the main menu? Also, this new iPod has a curved screen which is suppose to prevent scratches. The round screen invites glare; sound quality is only average.Is it necessary for the Apple Company to come out with a new "generation" Nano iPod every year? The answer to that is no. If Apple could just make the Nano the correct way in the beginning they would not have to keep altering it each year and feeding it to the public as "new" and "innovative". In a culture that has become dependent on the latest technological advances Apple is merely feeding their infatuation. Obsession has overcome even the most moral of people. For example, a close friend of mine who does not buy into the need to run out and buy the latest new technology consistently buys the new generation Nanos. In the end she is never happy with her purchase.The first generation Nano was priced at $199, the second generation was $199, the third generation, which cam out 11 months prior to the newest fourth generation, was $199. If you are similar to my friend, you also dished out $149. The total comes out to over $746 for pretty much the same item. A Nano iPod. On the other hand, I have had the same iPod classic since 2005 with no problems. This set me back $249 and it holds 30 GBs worth of information.Now each year when the newest one comes out and it seems like a great deal to buy an iPod for less than $200, you can see that it is not.</review>

<review id="6236">It's really very simple. Microsoft is changing Office for change's sake. The last version did everything I needed it to. Now, with their new interface, I have to hunt to do something as simple as justifying my margins. It has not improved my life, and it has decreased my productivity. Of course, our IT guys think I'm a Luddite for not wanting the latest and greatest, but this is clearly an example of more being less. The Emperor is naked.</review>

<review id="6239">I do not recommend this camera. I bought one and it has been repaired under warranty twice and I have only tried to use it twice (one trip to Galapagos, the other to the Carribean).

The connectors on the head would not fit my razor and I had to return an opened package.  Without opening the blister pack, there was no way of knowing whether or not it would fit.  This of course affects the amount of refund available.</review>

<review id="6241">Don't be fooled by the Cuisinart name, this is a rotten coffeemaker! I can't tell you how many times it has left cups full of water on my counter. The outer basket that holds the filter often catches the fine powder from the grind and clogs. That leaves grounds everywhere inside including the finished beverage. The company unfortunately has people that barely speak english staffing the phones who act like they're baffeled and don't understand why it wouldn't work.They told me to clean it even tough the indicator light had never lit. They also sent a brew basket replacement as a wild stab that it might do something. If you brew with this wonderful item under a cabinet the vent soaks your cabinets.A couple months later, now that I've cleaned it several times, the auto clean light is lit and we've been waiting an hour for the brew to finish.Now I know why a $150 item is selling for $64 mail order.</review>

<review id="6242">Allow me to state up front that the only Microsoft application I use is Excel. That said, I've been using Excel for Mac for as long as it's been on the market and use it quite intensely. I had hoped, after so many years of neglect, that it would get a worthy upgrade in 2008 in terms of taking advantage of the Intel processors in the latest Mac models, improvements in functionality, and overall bug fixes. For whatever reason, Excel 2008 fails to deliver on all counts and, in my experience, is a step backwards. Simple charts take an unacceptably long time to display, macros are gone, crashes happen after even the simplest tasks, and there are no discernible usability improvements to make this "upgrade" worthwhile. Perhaps the other Office applications in Office 2008 represent an improvement over their previous versions. Excel, however, does not and has, in fact, proven detrimental to my productivity.</review>

<review id="6243">I loved the whole concept of this bread machine!  Fuzzy logic, two mixing paddles, preheat, good recommendations...This is my third bread machine and I am distressed at how badly this machine has worked for me.  I tried everything.  I talked to Zojirushi and did what they said.  I've made 15 2lb white bricks I wouldn't call bread.  I am an electronic failure analyst in real life.  I believe there is a quality control problem at the factory probably in an integrated circuit or sensor.  That would explain why some people have had no troubles and a smaller percentage of us get messed up bread.  My previous bread machines were dump the stuff in and get great bread.  This one is hopeless.</review>

<review id="6244">Don't bother with this high-end machine.  For a bread machine rated at the top of available products, this was a very large disappointment -- and I am not new to bread machines.  First, the machine would not bake the bread.  Then, after calling Zojirushi Customer Service and, over the phone, following their instructions to check the machine, which allowed them to determine that the bake cycle was defective, I was instructed to send the machine to them to determine that it was defective.  Though they had a copy of my receipt from Amazon, they would not send a new machine until the "assistant manager" received and checked this one -- while I waited for a repaired or new machine.  I was willing to put the defective machine in the mail to them as soon as they shipped a new one to me with a tracking number.  To protect themselves from fraud is one thing; but this was nothing more than crass disregard of a reasonable, verified complaint and an unwillingness to back the product.   Only Amazon itself gave me full satisfaction with a return of this defective item -- which allowed me to immediately purchase another machine.</review>

<review id="6246">This review is from: Quantum of Solace [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)      First of all, take out the editor for destroying the audience's ability to simply enjoy an action sequence. An action sequence should be an understandable series of several threats/resolutions, with a mounting overall threat finally overcome with a clever, satisfying possibly surprising solution. Throw in some minute side stories to provide humor/expansion of the theme/ character development. Yes, I know there is a car chase, yes I know there is a chase and a fight...but they are just blurs, confusing and uninvolving. And since when does a Bond action sequence have to be cross-cut with a horse race to make excitment? Next take out the scriptwriters for making a robot out of Bond (Absolvement: Wade and Purvis probably under duress from the producers mesmerized by the Bourne francise/boxoffice). 1/2Bourne+1/2Bond=full bad. Especially sad: as a nod to the blowing up the bad guys HQ at the end Bond thang, they blow up a cardboard modernistic Motel 6. Craig is good, I like the tough guy unstopable force thing. The bad guy goal, to control the water supply of Bolivia?...oh the humanity! Judy Dench is great as M, a perfect mix of brains, management and iron. The two Bond gals are long-legged and yummy. So now Bond is a pilot, and can jump into a 60 year old DC-3 and rip up the skies? The title track was drivel, please don't assign this important task to the flavor of the moment rock star. Does anyone remember the Bond title track by "Garbage"? The poor British gal, killed by oil, her shining black body draped across a bed...Auric Goldfinger would have approved.</review>

<review id="6247">I really loved the first book and had high hopes.  But as other reviewers have mentioned, Bella's character just does not progress the way it seems she should.  She is still a very immature, selfish, snotty little brat.  It would make more sense if Edward didn't put up with it and told her to shape up or ship out.  But he doesn't.  And then there is the whole RIDICULOUS deal with Jacob.  She is supposedly so in love with Edward that she would DIE if he were to leave her, but then she keeps going behind his back and hurting him to see stupid, arrogant Jacob.  Edward needs to grow a pair and make Bella stop acting like a spoiled child.  I will be reading the final book just to see how it ends, but I am doubtful.  Oh and teens, this is NOT how love is in the real world.</review>

<review id="6250">Canon really dropped the ball on this one. As other posters have noted, the FS SD flash memory series of camcorders output in an oddball file format that's not readable by QuickTime. My hopes of being able to pop the FS100's SD card into my card reader and just click & drag my shots into iMovie immediately went down in flames - it was for that seemingly easy mode of import that we bought 2 of the bloody cameras in the first place (for use in a college A-V department, where easy is best for our toy borrowers - some of whom still put VHS tapes in upside down or backwards into the classroom VCRs...need I say more?). Included software was of no help, either - the ImageMixer 3 for SD is from Pixela, a Sony company, and stopped Mac support before OS X hit the market. Mac users might have better luck if they're running Leopard and have iMovie 8, which I don't. Therefore, our shiny new purple FS100s - while attractive little camcorders with wonderful  ergonomics and great optics - will remain lovely (and expensive) little paperweights until I either upgrade my already current Mac or Canon finally releases a software fix to allow Mac users the luxury of a working click & drag method of clip importing in a format recognizable to Macs.</review>

<review id="6254">I want to make this review rather short. First, it's an easy to install Gamepad and looks very promising. You have the easy PS2 feel, dual-analog control pads, and a comfortable fit. You can install the drivers or not. It doesn't really make a difference because Windows will recognize it.The problem with this Gamepad is that it is not very durable. I bought and tested this controller with MVP Baseball 2005 & Need for Speed Underground 2. What happened is, I had to take the controller back 3 times to have it replaced because the analog sticks would give out or get stuck in a certain postion. Now, in MVP Baseball, for example, you need the right stick to dive/slide with. Well, the analog stick stuck to the right in 2 of them I tried, so that ends up leaving you to have automatic fielding because you can't get to the ball when the player is diving for no reason. With Need for Speed, I found that the 1 controller where the left analog stick went out, the cars were just out of control.There are many reviews online as I have found that confirm that Logitech never addressed this controllers issues. Even Tech. Support kept telling me I had just bought a bad controller when I called them on each one. Be aware, once the analog stick goes, whether it is 2 days or 2 months, you can't calibrate it. The GamePad is useless. I would suggest you go with Nyko's AirFlo Gamepad instead. I've had no problems with that one.</review>

<review id="6255">Excel in MS2008 for Mac out and out sucks. It can't handle spreadsheets of a few hundred records without hanging repeatedly on my G4 notebook with 2 MB RAM and nothing else running. Then it has a totally useless automatic function that insists on trying to open the file on which it crashed, and of course, most of the time it hangs and you can't do anything until you change the name of the file so it can't find it. It does work on my Quad desktop with 4 MB RAM. Even then the software is so bloated that everything runs like frozen molasses. Word is not hanging on me but also has gone beyond becoming bloatware. The only reason I use it is because my workplace requires me to use Entourage and the rest of this bloatware.Wish I had read reviews before upgrading!</review>

<review id="6257">I liked this keyboard when I first got it despite some issues like the backlighting  not being bright enough, but within a year serious problems started. The 'd' key doesn't always trigger. The 'e' key also won't trigger sometimes, and when it does it doubles up. Other keys are starting to have the same problem. I can't type three sentences without having to go back and correct problems because of faulty keys. Why can't anyone seem to make a keyboard that lasts more than a year or two of heavy use anymore? For a keyboard that retails at around fifty bucks I really expect it to last longer than a four dollar keyboard I can get at the local cheapo computer store. Considering I have a basic cheap keyboard at work that has performed flawlessly for four years this premium keyboard is a huge disappointment.</review>

<review id="6258">I was excited to get a small and inexpensive mp3 player for the gym, since I was using my Samsung SCH-i730 phone as my mp3 player (which is quite bulky). However, much to my dismay, this thing cannot read folders AT ALL. No matter how you place your files on the thing, it dumps everything into one ridiculously huge list. And scrolling through 500-600 songs is a pain in the butt.I tried making playlists as well, but some of them wouldn't read correctly, and I am a computer engineering student, so technology is no difficulty for me. As well, I often listen to music randomly, so not being able to listen to my music except for pre-set playlists is extremely annoying. (Even worse: the shuffle feature can't shuffle a certain selection of songs or a playlist, so you have to manually create a "random" playlist on your PC, and then transfer it over.)Not being able to listen to music by folders was *definitely* a deal-breaker and I am no longer using this device. I went back to using my Samsung SCH-i730 phone as my mp3 player. I gave it two stars because the armband is great, and the headphones weren't too bad either. I am using the Sansa headphones with my phone.</review>

<review id="6261">In spite of having previously owned a Zip 100 drive that succumbed to the infamous &quot;clicking sound&quot; and eventually stopped working altogether, I decided to try out the newer 250 MB model on the assumption that Iomega had probably overcome the technical glitches.No such luck!  The drive began working erratically within 24 hours, and by the third day would only read the 250 MB disk in the dark (I'm not making this up), with no daylight or lamplight present.I sent the drive back and got a refund.  Never again, Iomega!</review>

<review id="6263">I have been a devotee of WD drives for years. I have 15 functioning on my work server (mostly in 2 e-sata enclosures using port multipliers), I have 4 inside my home machine right now, I have a good 30 sitting about for use here at home as I need them. They're work horses that always performed flawlessly...till now.These MYBOOKS with their sleep "feature" are criminally bad. Can't use them for servers as they will send a server crashing within 10 minutes of disuse in either SATA or FW 800 configurations. Used for backup, your backup will freeze within the same 10 minutes. The drive comes with backup software -- that's what they're being positioned for -- but they can't be left idle or they sleep and won't wake. Older model MYBOOKS (I have three) work fine. They are in an always-on mode. I thought I was simply buying more of the same when I purchased the Studio Pro models.This "feature" is built into the drive and system preferences won't override it. Some myopic developer decided what the community needed was a sleeping drive so what we've all got now are bricks. There is no "fix" coming from Western Digital. I called to inquire; that's coming from a Level 2 tech.Doing a google, there's a PC script to disable this mode and for Mac users, a chron script if you're brave enough to alter your root user password and create the invisible script in the terminal. I am not. This is like playing with Res Edit (I know, I'm dating myself...) and unless you're proficient, I would not recommend it.So use with caution. They're fine for your desktop where you can push the power button and prompt it to spin back up. They will cause you a lot of grief if you can't monitor it.</review>

<review id="6264">All of the folks complaining of system freezes and reboots when using this drive are true.  It seems to be erratic though so some users have no issues.  I have 4 PC's and 2 Mac's in the house.  This drive works fine on both mac's and 1 of the PC's.  The other 3 PC's barf when the drive is inserted and just reboot themselves.  It's the U3 software that causes the problems.  I have several other flash drives and they all work fine on all machines.  Risk it if you want, but there are better, cheaper, faster drives that won't give you headaches like this one.  Sandisk just lost a customer and is now on my list of companies that owe me a few hours of my life back.</review>

<review id="6266">I bought one of these to replace an older Linksys box that was 11b only.Setup was easy, and configurability better than my old Linksys. The box was also nice to look at.The problem is it simply doesn't work reliably. The router would reset itself around every 10 minutes while the wireless connection was in use. Also my network attached printer didn't get served an IP address. After trying all setting combinations and 3 versions of firmware (wasting 4-5 hours) this guy has gone back. For now I'm sticking with the old Linksys.</review>

<review id="6267">This review is from: Gone with the Wind (DVD)      How can anyone seriously criticize this film?  Well, some people can, but that's not my point.  The point is that this is the greatest American film since "Birth of a Nation."  Watch in awe as Scarlett and Ashley pine for the bygone days when the soft high sound of Negro laughter rises like the Louisiana marsh mist from the decrepit, rat-infested slave quarters swimming in lice and feces.  Chortle with Rhett as he sprays misogyny across Georgia like an alley cat with a urinary tract infection.  Pray with the Confederacy as it bravely attempts to defend time-honored traditions of patriarchal subjugation, racist contempt for human life and belligerent arrogance bordering on the psychotic.  Boo and hiss as uppity Negroes humiliate the once proud South by asking for things like civil rights and a decent standard of living.  Cheer for Scarlett (again) as she pops all her scruples like over-ripe zits in her pathological quest for a goal even she doesn't understand.  And finally, share in the triumph of the filmmakers as they achieve the astounding feat of creating sympathy and admiration for one of the most sordid and shameful chapters in American history.  Can you think of any reason modern audiences might not be totally pleased with this sugar-coated atavism?  I sure can't.</review>

<review id="6270">I would have loved to have done a video review of the Flip Classic, but my Flip stopped working only one month after I started using it. I only used it four or five times, in fact.What I liked: It's lightweight, simple, uses common AA batteries, and makes taking little videos easy.What I didn't like: The software is glitchy. The USB port is an accident waiting to happen--you really need to be very gentle and connect the camera via a USB cable. Also, after using the camera only four times, it just stopped working for no reason. It's not very rugged, apparently. I tried to turn it on today, and the Flip wouldn't power up. Well, it would get as far as displaying the logo screen and then it just went dead. I took the batteries out and put them back in, I tried brand new, fresh batteries, then new batteries of a different brand. Nothing. Dead Flip. Less than two months from when it came out of the package.Although customer service does meet their claim to respond to an email in under four hours, there was no explanation as to what might be causing the problem. I was able to plug the Flip into the computer and copy all of my videos, but it doesn't look like I'll be making new ones.After looking around online for information about my Flip, I found a lot of articles and discussions about Flip malfunctions. These cameras are just terribly plagued by defects and problems, including the one I bought. Mine went dead after four uses and gentle handling. I want my money back.</review>

<review id="6271">Very unhappy.  The collar works when I blow hard in it but put it on the dog and doesn't even work.  And what's worse is that I cannot return it once it is used.  How are you going to know about a product unless you use it.  Most companies accept returns so I didn't think to read the return policy.  They have a 15% re-stocking fee!  Ridiculous!

<review id="6274">'Rachel Getting Married' is the story of Kym (played by Anne Hathaway), a dysfunctional ex-addict who returns home for her sister's wedding after receiving a weekend furlough from a rehab facility. The film is shot in the hand-held style of a 'you-are-there' documentary. Quite a bit of the dialog seems as if it was improvised.The story unfolds slowly. We're introduced to Kym just as she returns home as the wedding preparations are under way. She's an emotional wreck, needy, angry and sometimes paranoid. She acts impulsively (immediately having sex with the groom's best man). Rachel has a 'tough love' attitude toward her sister and expects her to curtail her acting out behavior especially during the wedding festivities. Their father however is guilt-ridden over Kym's troubled past and can best be described as an 'enabler'; he argues with Rachel as he feels she's too hard on her sister. In a very long, drawn out scene, various guests toast the expectant bride and groom and Kym 'apologizes' for her past bad behavior to her sister; the speech comes off as nasty and self-indulgent which alienates Rachel's guests. The night before the wedding, Rachel and Kym's long-divorced mother (played by Debra Winger) shows up and she gets into an argument with Kym where they end up slapping each other. During this argument, a dark family secret is revealed: while high on drugs, Kym had a car accident years ago resulting in the death of their 10 year old brother.Kym has her 'dark moment of the soul' after arguing with her mother. She gets in the family car and drives it into a wooded area and deliberately crashes it into a tree. The deployment of an air bag saves her from serious injury. She's escorted back to the house by the police where she pulls herself together enough to attend the actual wedding (since the bride and groom are an interracial couple, the merriment, including quite a bit of dancing and singing, has a decided multicultural flavor).The day after the wedding, the mother leaves and bids Rachel a fond farewell. However, her goodbyes to Kym are much cooler and restrained. Kym's counselor picks her up to bring her back to the rehab facility where she will continue with her treatment.The film's screenwriter, Jenny Lumet (yes you guessed it, daughter of director Sidney Lumet) tries so hard to make the principal characters sympathetic but ends up depicting them as neurotic and unlikeable. Lumet creates the cardinal sin of screen writing when her main character doesn't change throughout the story. Kym remains insufferably narcissistic and self-pitying. Either have your main character change for the better (e.g. Dorothy learning the lesson of 'home sweet home' in the Wizard of Oz) or tragically get worse and fail to learn the lesson he needs to (e.g. Al Pacino's 'shattered globe' at the end of 'Scarface', symbol of the illusory world he wished to conquer). Other neurotic one-note characters include the aforementioned father (the 'enabler'), the unforgiving mother, horny best man and petulant bridesmaid.Rachel appears to be the most well-rounded of the characters in the film who has a strong enough ego to actually like herself. Sidney, the fianc?and subsequent groom, is nothing more than a smiling cipher. The rest of the guests are unknown entities, as the screenwriter chose not to develop them as multi-dimensional characters. The family members do a lot of toasting of one another but we never find out anything about them of any substance whatsoever.To confess, I never thought of Jonathan Demme as one of the great directors of our era. And certainly this vanity project proves that he is not. And certainly Jenny Lumet is following in the footsteps of Sofia Coppola, a no-talent who has only succeeded in the movie business due to nepotism.In the end, 'Rachel Getting Married' emulates the Robert Altman style of film-making--that's where you create neurotic (or in some cases unlikeable) straw men, shoot them down and then claim you're a great artist because you had the insight to see through the phony characters you created.</review>

<review id="6275">Twilight is such a boring movie I couldn't watch the whole movie!I tried to like it,but it has so much bad acting in it.I don't know whats the big deal with this movie it doesn't even have good action in it.This movie is great if your 13 or a bimbo.The story is weak and doesn't have a point,this girl moves to a new town and meets a vampire guy and falls in love,this is so unoriginal!This movie has to be one of the worst movies Ive seen in a long time and I seen a lot of cheesy horror movies.In conclusion,Twilight is a stupid unoriginal vampire movie that has bad acting and worst writing.I don't know why someone would buy this or even watch this boring movie.I'm disappointed that I actually wasted my time watching this movie,I guess you have to be really young to like this movie.</review>

<review id="6278">My Zojirushi coffee maker stopped working yesterday. I bought it 11/12/08 from Amazon -- that's less than 3 months. It simply will not brew although the ON button is pressed. I am going to try taking it to a service center. There are many reviews that say this same thing happened -- this machine has a problem.

<review id="6284">I picked up a Lycosa at Best Buy when my Logitech G15 died. Big mistake.The Lycosa is 'stylish' and 'pretty' I guess, but there are a number of bugs.Like a few other reviewers, my Lycosa goes into 'disco mode', when the backlight continuously flashes and keys stop responding. This persists until I yank the USB and put it back in. An enormous problem considering this IS supposed to be a gaming keyboard. (Though I dunno WHY. All this gives to gamers is a WASD cluster light.. woopdeedoo. Chances are you'll want ALL the lights on anyway. What's the point?)Other bugs include the volume on my PC randomly getting cranked to full. Which is quite unpleasant when I have my headphones on.I've e-mailed and appealed to Razer about all these problems but they are completely mum on the subject and totally unwilling to help.This keyboard is a piece of garbage.

<review id="6286">And by "wow" I mean, that was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting in this movie is complete crap with Bella being portrayed as a whiny, moody [.....]the whole time. It's also ridiculous how much of the story is about Edward telling Bella that she shouldn't love him and the only reason she does is because he's a vampire and is going to kill her. And her obvious immaturity shows when she basically replies "but I love you and I don't think you'll really kill me." Besides the horrible acting and storyline the script was ludicrous and made me laugh out loud at inappropriate times. For example: using "spider monkey" as a term of endearment.Just so all of you Twilight obsessed people know, I did read the books too, (they're crap btw and will probably lead you to need a therapist if you base your future relationships on them) so I'm not just basing all of this off of the movie.</review>

<review id="6287">Okay, I'm embarrassed to say I bought into the hype, I'd seen a number of people raving about this tool and with two pets (cat and dog) that shed pretty regularly, I thought I might as well get one and see if it works for mine. Even at a sale price, it was probably the most expensive grooming tool I personally have ever bought!My cat is a Maine Coon and a shedding machine. So I thought I'd try it first on him. And yes, the comb got out a lot of hair. But I just didn't see any difference in the results that I got with it versus the undercoat rake that I typically use (and that cost me about $[...]). I still had hair floating all around the room and a day later, he was still shedding fur all over the house again. I was hoping he would object less to getting combed out with this tool as well, but no such luck, he still growled and hissed through the whole session. Moving on to my sheltie, my results with him were even worse. This comb pulls out the overcoat, the guard hairs that they do not shed! And left plenty of undercoat behind in the process. It is totally useless on a long-haired, double-coated breed like this, not only leaving the loose hair underneath behind, but actually *damaging* the coat! I will not ever be using this comb on my sheltie(s) again, even an undercoat rake does not pull out guard hairs the way this comb did. Overall, totally disappointed in this overpriced tool. I gave it 2 stars for at least doing a decent enough job on my cat. But for the price, I expected much better.</review>

<review id="6288">Do not even think you can use this as a router.   The description alludes that it can be used as one, but it is not.   Waste of money and time.</review>

<review id="6289">The configuration options are great (associating IP's with specific MAC's, port forwarding, etc), but I've had it for about a month and had to reboot (i.e., unplug and replug the power cord) 6 or 7 times, because it will suddenly cut off all internet access and no longer respond when I try and open the web configuration tool (or even just ping it).  I DO NOT have to reboot the DSL modem, so I reason the problem is the WGR614.

This quickly causes a gunk build up in both the brush head base and the unit. It is almost impossible to get it into all the crevices to clean it thoroughly even with Qtips and other implements. Eventually, you see mold and bacteria developing and this is not sanitary.I don't know if the Oral B product is designed more effectively but I'm going to check.</review>

<review id="6297">We have gone through two of these in 5 months.  A nanny recommended a sound machine for our baby.  It is great at getting him to sleep, but this model stopped working.  At first it would just magically stop working.  I would wiggle the cord and it would turn back on.  After awhile it stopped working altogether.  We bought a second one (same model because it's the only one we could find in a store) and it did the same thing.  We have switched to the Conair version (bought on Amazon.com) and it has not given us any problems.</review>

<review id="6299">I received this for Christmas.  I tried to use it for the first time and I could not get the machine to work.  I called the help number, and an hour later, with someone telling what to do, it still would not work.    A button was broken on the machine and therefore it would not operate at all.  I was told to fax my invoice and then send the machine back after I called them to get an RMA.  It took me over 4 weeks to get the bread machine back.  But they did not send me the TR875-2 machine that I purchased and sent back because it was under warranty - instead they sent me the TR2828 machine that was "refurbished" and they do not even sell this machine anymore.  From what I can gather - this machine is from the year 2000.  I called to complain and they said the instrution manual states under their warranty policy that they can send any machine back in place of the defective machine.  Needless to say, I am stuck with this used machine.  I will never recommend Breadman to anyone, and regret not buying a better known brand appliance.</review>

<review id="6302">I might have been one of the first people to ever purchase the Jaz Drive they sold years ago when it came out.  I didn't have a good experience with that even though it was suppose to be the high end of their product line.  But I still gave their Zip drives a chance because of how highly so many people have raved about their convience.  So when I eventually purchased one I had problems with their Zip drives too.  I believe it has been more than just bad luck.I suggestion if anyone wants mass storage they should get Compact Flash (CF) cards to use.  These are solid state memory (meaning no moving parts) and much more durable and reliable then anything on the market at this time.  They do cost more but these things are well worth it becuase if you travel around with a notebook computer like me you'll also see how little battery power CF cards drain your battery.  If you choose this option the only other thing you need to get with your CF card is a USB CF card reader (which aren't expensive at all) and if you like to really save the power on your laptop you might want to also get a PC card adapter for your new CF card like myself.Then there is also the ability for you to use your CF card on other things like PDA's, Digital Cameras, etc.  So you don't have to feel you have spent all this money and also limited yourself to only one use for it.</review>

<review id="6303">The Turbo tax program is becoming a ripoff. Last year, they Removed the Capital Gains Tax section including the Employee Stock Purchase (Capital Gains ) from the "Deluxe " edition. That is now part of the "PREMIER" edition add-on which costs an additonal $35. So it would cost one at $75 for what they used to give you at $43.Also they used to refund the cost of filing a federal return. I don't remeber getting that refund last year.</review>

<review id="6308">I used TurboTax Deluxe and TaxCut Premium in parallel on my Mac to do two tax returns, one with rental properties, a side business, and investments.  I won't keep you in suspense: TurboTax is better.  Given the recent Intuit shenanigans with TurboTax limitations and pricing, I really wanted to discover that TaxCut was better.  Alas, that was not to be.So what's better about TurboTax?  The most significant for me is TurboTax's display of last-year and this-year amount columns in the wages and income summary (you get there with "select specific topics" and after you visit each topic), the deductions and credits summary, and in the rental common expenses interviews.  They are the best way to see what I need to do, and what I might have forgotten.  Like those home owner's association dues on one of my properties that I almost forgot.  TaxCut does provide a two-year summary, as does TurboTax.  However I don't find that very useful in either program since it's at a high level.  Also TaxCut shows it as a form, which is an inconvenient way to look at it.TaxCut also manages to be annoying in how it displays last year's imported data.  There is a single column with blue numbers for last year.  You might think that they would change color or something when you enter this year's data, but no.  TaxCut doesn't even keep track of what I've entered, since it asks me if I replaced the old information, when that's what I just did.  The display and questions are confusing and less than helpful.The two columns in TurboTax, with "not visited" in the this-year column until I do something with it, as well as buttons that say Revisit if I've been there or Start if I haven't, is the right way to do it.  (Though I wish TurboTax would display this year in black and last year in gray, instead of the other way around.)Another nice thing in TurboTax is that I can have two returns open at the same time and work on them both.  Not so with TaxCut.  TurboTax enables much easier what-ifs between two returns, like who gets which dependents.Again, TaxCut manages to be annoying even in opening the one return, since it doesn't remember was I was doing.  TaxCut always comes up with the same window, making me pick work on an old return and click on it.  The first time I came back, TaxCut didn't even know what directory I had saved the return in.TurboTax comes up with the last return I was working on already open, with a button to continue where I left off.  One flaw in TurboTax is that it doesn't remember that I had two returns open -- it only opens that last one I was messing with.TurboTax always checks for updates when you launch it.  TaxCut requires that you do that manually.  TaxCut might let you know on an interview page if it happens to know that an update is forthcoming.There were many times that TaxCut had a very short, arbitrary limit on the number of characters in a field, which prevented me from entering what I needed to identify what it was both for the IRS, and for myself next year.  There may be field limits in TurboTax as well, but I never ran into them.TaxCut also made it very difficult to look at the form relevant to what I am currently working on.  In TurboTax I just hit the forms button in the upper right (and the little feetsies to get back), and I'm there.  In TaxCut, I had to go find the form, if I even knew which form it was, and once there the display was cumbersome.TurboTax also makes it easy to move between forms and worksheets by double-clicking on numbers that come from another form or worksheet.  You end up at the source for that number.  TaxCut instead asks you if you want to override the number from the unspecified different form.I won't go into the myriad of little things, like TurboTax accepts 08 for 2008, where TaxCut requires you type 2008, or that TaxCut doesn't use the little red button in the corner and doesn't keep track of whether you've made any changes and need to save, but suffice it to say that in many ways TurboTax was much more pleasant to use.Some things that are better in TaxCut: the Child EIC and tax credit rules are more clear in the interview process; the Next button mostly stayed in the same place making it easy to review, where in TurboTax the Continue button keeps moving around; TaxCut separates the deductions from the credits, which I like better than TurboTax which munges them together in one page; and of course the biggie, which is that TaxCut never bugs me about upgrading to the next version and sending them another $30 or $40 like TurboTax does *incessantly*.But the few good things come nowhere near balancing the bad things about TaxCut.  Unfortunately, I have to recommend TurboTax Deluxe over TaxCut Premium.[This review can also be found under TurboTax Deluxe federal + state.]</review>

<review id="6309">This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      Someone please tell me why this movie is ranked so high?  I have never seen anything so boring.  There is no dialogue for the first 40 minutes.My son will usually watch anything animated and he couldn't last through it.  I kept watching thinking it would get better.  It was a complete waste of time.</review>

<review id="6310">This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      Pixar got full of itself.  Very poor development of Wall E.  I didn't care about him at all.  Instead of you feeling sorry for him for being alone, they thrust you immediately into caring for him, almost presuming you will.  I loved their previous movies, but Wall E went only for the gags and no development.  Instead, they regurgitate Johnny 5 from Short Circuit and assume you will care about him.  I didn't.  I maybe laughed twice and basically forced myself to watch the whole thing to see if it would get better.  I can only hope their next movie will be a lot better than this.  I want my last couple of hours back.</review>

<review id="6311">I really liked Twilight.  I did.  There was genuine and interesting conflict and I while saw Bella as slightly obsessed I looked forward to some real maturity.  New Moon was pretty good too, and I liked that Bella found some healing in her friendship with Jacob.  As for Eclipse, man was I disappointed.  First of all, does this girl EVER stay conscious?  She is either fainting from exhaustion, sexual repression, or unable to survive her own self-loathing.  I read patiently, waiting for a plot bigger than the Jacob/Bella/Edward love triangle.  Nope.  Grow a spine Bella, spend some time with your family and take a time out from the men you so willingly let control your life.  Edward, stop being so virtuous all the time, it as annoying as Bella's whining.  I want to slap you both.Jacob, quit being a jerk.  Threatening to kill yourself unless someone kisses you sounds more than a little desperate.I did not approve of Jacob's forceful embrace at the end, at ALL, but to tell you the truth, I was so SICK of Bella and Edward being so "careful" that I was actually cheering when I read a scene where two people kiss, they get caught up in the moment, and then calmly and naturally finish, the way a real kiss normally goes(even if it was coerced).  Wow, are the intimate scenes really that unfulfilling?  I couldn't take anymore of this "kiss, excitement, screeching halt! and then, Bella you'll be the death of me."  It got really old really fast.  And why does Edward get to be the one to instigate the intimacy all the time?  I find that incredibly unfair and frankly pretty creepy.  Edward is definitely a control freak, and, despite Bella's denial of it, she is definitely a masochist.However, I will read the fourth book because I want to know if the author will let Bella become a vampire (Please! I can't take anymore martyrdom and self-sacrifice) and if she does how she will deal with her family, her instincts, and if she gets any "special powers?"  I am almost afraid I'll read that Bella's powers will do something like cause anyone in her proximity trip over their own feet while professing to be the most selfish person in the universe as they declare their undying love to the first two people they see and faint in the process.  Actually, I think I'd rather like to see that; it would make encountering Volturi pretty interesting.</review>

<review id="6314">From the moment I got it the m250 it had a hard time turning on. And as time went by, say 3 weeks it was extremely difficult to get the device to turn on. And there was about a week that I didn't even use the device bc I was waiting for my audiobook to come in the mail. When it came on I was thrilled with its ease of use and quality it provided, but I only expect it to get worse. If I use it then turn it off, I have to wait several hours to get it back on : /  Very frustrating, but you get what you pay for.</review>

<review id="6315">From all the glowing reviews, I guess I saw another Woody Allen film with the same title.  Aside from the performances, there was little to enjoy.  The script meanders, and the constant voiceover was unnecessary and irritating.  You don't need to have the voiceover tell me that they spent their evenings drinking wine and eating in cafes if you're showing the actors drinking wine and eating in cafes.  At the end of the film, the characters had not evolved and nothing came of their time together.  The entire series of events was of little consequence and so was this film.</review>

<review id="6316">Purchased this camera for my wife at Christmas due to its affordable price and ease of use.  Although the camera itself works like a charm, you do get what you pay for.  The included software completely refuses to load on my wife's Win XP computer and technical support at Flip has been completely worthless, communicating only via email (no listed support line) and simply sends the same generic system requirements email each time.  The technical forums on the web are littered with people having the same issue but still no response from Flip.  If you have a computer running anything but Win XP SP2, you should be ok, otherwise prepare to own a useless video camera.</review>

<review id="6317">I won't reproduce the more general complaints that others have made.  But in case it's of any use to any of you, I'll note that, as an expatriate, I've found this very frustrating to use.  I'm constantly having to "educate" the software on US tax law.  Since I work for a foreign university, all of my income is non-W2; this means I have to skip the easy "fill in the blanks" format and go to the "forms" version.  And then in the federal review section I'm always told I can't contribute to an IRA because my earned income is $0-- because of the foreign income exclusion.  I did my taxes last week: my earned income was around $140k, and so even after excluding the maximum amount of foreign income-- which is some $87k-- I still had about $50k of legitimate "earned income" on which I can base my IRA contributions.  And since I checked the box for "no, neither I nor my spouse has a US-approved employer-sponsored plan," I'm also eligible to deduct the contribution.  I've verified this with two accountants AND the IRS-- and also seen on the IRS website that I am indeed correct.  Yet TurboTax doesn't "get" it, so I'm constantly having to use the "override" function and also simply ignore a lot of useless "federal review" objections.This being the case, what else (unbeknownst to me) is the software wrong about?  Why should I have confidence that the software gets ANYTHING correct?But I'm happy to award that single star because at least I don't have to look up the 2555 and 1116 forms on my own, and that's worth $50 to me.</review>

<review id="6318">I have never written a review before-and i have bought hundreds of Amazon products, so this should tell you something. I recently read an article on Tracy Anderson and was excited about her new workout DVD. I ordered it and couldn't wait to try it out. I don't usually like home workout DVD's but I thought i'd give this one a shot. Well, I have to say I am completely disappointed-and it's not the workout, it's HER. She is a TERRIBLE instructor. She hardly talks or explains what to do and she doesn't count down to let you know when you should change. There is a section on the DVD for standing abs where she rocks back and forth and every which way. Well whomever shot this DVD needs to go back to workout video school because a lot of the time it is shot over her head so you can't see which way she is rocking and she doesn't bother to tell you where to go. She simply says, 'this takes time to figure out but you'll get it.' I mean, they could have at least included paper instructions for some of the exercises. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out a workout video, but for $29.99, I'd expect a little bit more. I mean-who cares if she trains Madonna and Gwyneth. As long as she explains the moves, she could train Spongebob Square PAnts for all I care!</review>

<review id="6319">Maybe my baby was unusually strong and tall; however, this flimsy blanket would not hold him from the moment he came home from the hospital.  We thought my mom (his grandma) would have an easier time using the SwaddleMe than using the origami-style wrapping of hospital receiving blankets... but it was a total joke.Having lost faith in all the quick wraps, I was as surprised as anyone when we had to turn to the "Amazing Miracle Blanket" when he was too strong and tall to stay swaddled in our tightest blanket wraps. The name just sounded too silly to me, but I'm a convert.  I highly recommend that product instead.</review>

<review id="6322">I purchased this router to replace an again Netgear G device that was failing.  After two days of trying to get it to work properly with my home network I finally gave up and returned it.To be fair, I must admit that I have a large network with various vintages and makes of wireless gear.  As I would try to make changes to add devices it would continually drop others.  Most frustrating was that it didn't "play well" with a couple of Linksys Gaming Adapters that I have attached to my DirecTV DVR's.  It also had much lower signal strength than my 3+ year old Netgear.I did really like the interface and the LELA tool but if it won't connect and stay connected all the pretty tools in the world are worthless.  Also, the USB port to add storage is a really nice feature.If you have a network with a lot of new (i.e., mostly 802.11n gear) this might be a wonderful router but it just didn't perform in my mixed environment.</review>

<review id="6324">I really wanted to like this machine. I've been using linux for 5 years, and would like nothing better than to see peace, love, and linux spread throughout the world.The biggest problem, which caused me to return the machine, was that I couldn't get wifi to work. The Eee was able to detect my wifi network, but when I told it to connect to it, I got "No DHCPOFFERS received." If you try a google search on "eee pc" "No DHCPOFFERS received", you'll get a bunch of hits on Asus's forums, where lots and lots of users are reporting the same problem. I might expect some hassles on a machine where I installed the drivers myself, or where I installed the wifi card myself. But when I pay for a machine that's got a preinstalled OS and preinstalled wifi, I expect it to work. I called Asus's tech support, and they figured out that the machine was shipped with an RaLink wifi card, when it should have been Atheros. They told me it wasn't going to work, and my only option was to return the machine.Other impressions:I expected the screen to be small, the trackpad to be awkward, and the GUI to be unresponsive, and they were. This is a netbook, so that's what you expect.Xandros, unlike any other Linux distribution I've ever used, requires you to click through various EULAs to use the software. There was a EULA when I did the initial boot, and a EULA to use Star Office. This is lame. Open-source software does have licenses associated with it (e.g., the GPL), but they're not end-user licenses, and there's no reason to make the end user click through them.The default desktop is cluttered with useless junk like special icons to get to Wikipedia and Google Maps.They seem to expect you to access certain functionality through cryptic key combinations like Fn-F1 (open a wireless connection) and Ctrl-Alt-T (open a terminal window). This is not so bad if there's some other way to do it, which was the case for the wireless connection, but didn't seem to be the case for the terminal window. It's fine if they want to show certain functionality less prominently because it's not of interest to all users, but there should still be some way to discover it through the GUI without having to do a Google search.</review>

<review id="6325">I bought this for my son from Target two weeks ago for a birthday present.  Its been freezing up right out of the box.  If I try to plug it into any aftermarket IPOD docking station (ie ILive or Bose) it reads that it isnt charging compatible and it freezes again.  Techsupport instructs me to toggle the Hold switch or to reset it holding the Menu and Center button but the clickwheel still wont unfreeze.  The support is lousy and everywhere I try to find any answers it seems that the "company" has sent its minions to delete the postings.  If it wasnt for my son loving the thing I would just return it and buy him a more user friendly MP3 player.</review>

<review id="6326">I was a long time TT user. I decided not to use it this year because of the additional hidden charges. I went with a competitor this time around. I voted with my wallet, but I also wanted to vote here and give this product 1 star. The competitor's product was just as easy to use and there were no hidden fees or nickle and dime charges. I can't support a company that hides charges. It reminds me of some of the airlines and all of the nickle and dime policies. If you can't run a business with an up-front and honest business model, you should bow out to your competitors and move on to something else. These shady policies get no sympathy from me and destroy customer confidence.In my opinion, even though Intuit backtracked (and they've now entered damage control mode), they lost me for life -- I've now moved on to an alternative.</review>

No matter how many times I updated the driver and reinstalled the software, the keyboard simply refused to work.  Ideazon's tech support is simply abysmal.  This is a company that DOES NOT list their phone number anywhere on their website or within their literature.  They do not want to talk to you.  All their tech support is done via e-mail, which is inherently slow, inefficient, and ultimately pointless.To sum up, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!

<review id="6334">First I would like to note that this review will contain spoilers so, reader beware!I had never heard of the twilight series until the summer when Breaking Dawn was released, and I never actually read the books until the beginning of November. I didn't want to go into the movie theater not having read the books. I am not a die-hard twilight fan, but I loved the story and read all of the books within the course of two weeks. I thought Stephanie Meyers needed to improve on her writing, seeing as there was very little character development and moments in the book where I felt she was just writing for the sake of making the book longer.Although I had a few problems, I fell in love with the story, but was extremely disappointed in this final chapter. I have been reading reviews and agree with others on the point that Edward just becomes a shell of what he used to be, no longer the love of all of our lives. Jacob's imprinting on Renesme, while nice for him to still be able to be in Bella's life, is very creepy and unsettling. Also, Belle's character, who I have never been particularly fond of, still maintains that very annoying edge, but none of these points are what completely turned me away from this book.The main plot of the story is Bella and Edward's daughter, who is a mutant mix between human and vampire. The Volturi discover this child and a huge controversy arises where the Cullens have to bring together a large group of vampires from all around the world as witnesses so the Volturi don't kill the baby. This story could have had a fabulous ending because there was so much build-up and tension surrounding the confrontation. Instead Meyer provides a very simple ending, leaving the reader disappointed and wondering why there was so much build-up. It could be compared to a movie where two sides spend the entire movie preparing for battle (buying weapons, training) but when brought together spend a few minutes glaring, then shake hands an part ways. There were also alot of unanswered questions at the end of the series. As a HUGE Harry Potter Fan, I was spoiled with JK Rowlings tidy ending, wrapping up the loose ends. I'm not saying that she wrapped everything up cause there may have been a few tiny loose strings, but Breaking Dawn had so many unanswered questions at the end of the book. Why, for example, did Charlie and Billy hate each other? I felt as though there were so many things that could have been resolved which weren't. For me, the ending of a movie can make or break a book and Stephanie Meyer had a really let down with this one for me.</review>

<review id="6336">Bond Schmond.  Bourne, McClane, not even Ace Ventura can elevate foolishness to this level of absolute goofy absurdity.  If intelligence is Mercury, Transporter 3 is Pluto.  No gov't bailout could save this massive debt of dumbness. No hope for common sense, somebody owes me an hour and a half back.  Oh well, at least I didn't pay to see this turd.Now, I love a good action movie, even if it stretches the realm of realism.  A competent director can make you accept the impossible, like in Tarantino's KILL BILL or Besson's TAKEN.  But unfortunately there never is a single shred of believability here.  The nonsense completely undermines the decent fight choreography and quasi-impressive stunts.  Example--Frank escaping the bad guys by driving his car into the river and using air from the tire to breathe underwater?  Stupid!  There's plenty more where that came from. Anyway, I'm done ranting about this garbage.  If you liked DIE HARD 4, this movie might be for you.</review>

<review id="6337">Digital Media source sent me the wrong product (a cheaper one) - then informed me that i would receive the correct product and a refund of the return mailing expenses when i returned the incorrect product. however, several days after mailing the incorrect product back, i was notified that i would receive a refund on my credit card. when i emailed digital media, there was no response and to this day i have not received the promised refund for my mailing expenses.</review>

<review id="6338">This product is not worth the money. The product does taste horrible but it doesnt last long, maybe a day depends on how much you wash your hands. I wouldnt buy it from folica. This is the second time i ordered from them and they screwed up twice. When I ordered Mavala they sent me two in differnt packages and charged me twice and twice the shipping. I refused one of the packages at the door. And was only refunded for one product but still had to pay for the shipping one both. They say they dont refund shipping. They are hard to get a hold of too. I will never order from them again.</review>

<review id="6339">I believe the negative aspect of the product is more important for the readers, the package included with an installation guide and a CD. I was unable to install it myself even I followed the instructions given. I had to spend lots of time to get this install; finally I got help from the customer service and go it installed. The customer service was fairly good and they gave totally different steps for installation. I think they better include those steps as the installation guide. I know for sure, if I have to install this again, I need customer service help. There is no continuous connectivity, after one or two days I always have to reboot the router. I'm disappointed with this product and do not recommend for others.</review>

<review id="6340">Review target audience: Users with VOIP or running servers behind their router. Hardware D-link DIR-655, Firmware 1.10, Hardware Model A2.I purchased this model solely to do VOIP Quality Of Service (QOS) traffic shaping (the router is based on the Ubicom StreamEngine 5106 chip), I run an asterisk / mail server behind my firewall.  My existing set-up was a pcengines wrap board with m0n0wall firewall with QOS via traffic shaper utilizing a dedicated uplink pipe for VOIP (only drawback was the reduced uplink for external mail users).The DIR-655 promised to get rid of permanently reduced uplink by dynamically managing the uplink when VOIP was active.  The result however, was no better than with the m0n0wall traffic shaper if downloading an iso image whilst making a VOIP call.  It still would have made a huge difference compared to no QOS, but the DIR-655 is still no better than alternative solutions. However, the real problem with this router is STABILITY, or lack of it.  My wrap board could go months without losing dropping the ADSL connection - very important for external mail clients with a dynamic IP address.  The DIR-655 seemed to drop the connection every 30 minutes or so, even with DynDNS, getting a new IP address this often is a pain.  Further VOIP calls were regularly terminated by the router dropping the connection.  Simply unacceptable.I turned on the syslog function, but could not get any useful diagnostic information as to the reason for the crash.  According to Ubicom, they run a proprietary OS optimised for network handling so there is little chance of the problems being fixed with third party open source software such as openwrt (openwrt developers state the Ubicom chip will not be supported).I have now reverted back to my original set-up and have had no problems since.Summary. Frequent dropped connections, interrupted VOIP, QOS no better than other options freely available.  On paper, this should be THE router that everyone needs, however it simply does not deliver, I cannot recommend it.Edit: Switching the QOS OFF appears to prevent spontaneous reboots with firmware version 1.10</review>

<review id="6341">Have had this router for 1.5 years.  It worked for a while, and then would periodically drop connections.  Calling Netgear is great, if you have 1 hour to spend on hold.  Once you get someone on the phone, they are rude, assume you are ignorant, and then, maybe will replace it.  I was sent a replacement unit, and it had a huge crack on the front.  I called Netgear, and they said if it works, why do you care?  What?  Anyway, got a replacement unit that was not cracked, and it worked for 1 month (probably someone else's return), and called Netgear.  I was told to re-install the firmware.  Again... what??  Who has ever heard of re-installing firmware?  This router is junk, and I will not buy another Netgear product (although I have a switch of theirs, and it works fine).  Bad products, bad service.  Linksys or Airport here I come...</review>

<review id="6344">When you pay $300 for a juicer you expect Hi-Q all the way. This machine has a powerful motor and a heavy-duty stainless steel look. But, oh, it lets you down! I've owned one for 6 months and take pretty good care to rinse and wash the parts after use. But apparently pretty good is not enough. After 6 months my 3 times a week carrot-beet juice seems to have KOed the filter basket. Plus the "titanium cutting wheel" seems now to have dulled itself sending gobs of wet pulp to the waste catcher rather than into my juice. It amounts to  $60+ replacement. What a sting! For 10 years I had a French made Tefal juicer ($49) and it worked just fine. This super high-priced replacement has failed me in 6 months. Sorely disappointed and feeling ripped off especially after reading all these glowing Amazon reviews.</review>

<review id="6345">I had owned a WD 80gb external hard drive for a year before buying this WD 500gb external hard drive.  I was VERY happy with the 80gb, but just as equally disappointed in the 500gb drive.  This drive locks up my computer and will not let my computer boot up on a regular basis.  I have to manually unplug the hard drive EVERY TIME I restart my computer.  The only reason that I am giving it 2 stars, is because it does store data.I called WD about the problem and wrote to them but they were no help and offered no solution.  As such, I am getting ready to purchase another external hard drive in the near future, but will not be purchasing another WD product because of their lack of support.  I would strongly urge everyone to look at the reviews here and decide for yourself!  Good luck...</review>

<review id="6347">When my old Krups AromaControl thermal carafe coffee maker gave its last gasp after 5+ years of service, I knew we did not want to go back to the glass carafe/burner model. After going through reviews for about 2 weeks, I settled on trying out this Zojirushi as it seemed to be the best bang for the buck. It arrived tonight, I brewed a pot of water through it, and then logged on to print out the return paperwork.Pros (from my limited use): It's aesthetically pleasing. It seemed to produce a very hot pot of water (I didn't stick a thermometer in it, but it seemed adequately hot). Cons: 1) The Lid! Whoever designed this thing should take some courses in ergonomics! After brewing the pot of water, my girlfriend could not twist the lid to the pouring position. I could only open it with a towel covering it. Neither of us have arthritis or impaired use of our hands. The little teeth on the lid are just downright painful! I am certain that my Mother would never be able to pour herself a cup of coffee from this thing if she were visiting. I read other reviewers keep a jar opener or cloth near the pot to remedy this. I'm not willing to clutter up my counter top.  2) The height of the carafe was a minor issue for us. We typically get filtered water through the refrigerator door dispenser. This carafe is too tall to fit. I tried filling it at an angle, but could only get about 8 cups in it. Kind of a hassle. I know, the purists will gasp and say you shouldn't fill the reservoir with water from the carafe. Oh well. I'm just making Sumatra for the drive to work, not some rare roast that I'm going to sip, savor, and philosophize over.3) Another minor complaint: In addition to the un-openable lid, there is a little cover that fits over the portion of the lid that coffee drains through during the brewing process. You put it on after removing the carafe from the coffeemaker, to prevent heat loss through those openings. I suspect this would be lost or misplaced rather quickly.If not for the lid, I'd probably keep it. Not being able to pour the coffee defeats the purpose of the coffee maker. The search continues! Update: The search is over. I settled on a Cuisinart Brew Central Thermal 12-cup. More pricey, and only seems to be available from that gigantic coffee shop chain, but it is a great coffee maker. It makes piping hot coffee, my Mom can pour coffee out of it, the carafe fits in the fridge door, and there is no little lid cover to get lost.</review>

<review id="6348">I read all of the reviews before I purchased this and knew that batteries might be an issue, so when my collar didn't work properly, I bought new batteries hoping that was the problem.  The collar never worked below a setting of 5, and rarely worked above that setting.  When it did work, it was inconsistent in its power.  Additionally, its range was less than 15 feet--not much help when your dog is racing around the backyard or throughout the house in a barking frenzy.  This is a product that needs to be consistent if it is to be helpful.</review>

<review id="6349">My advice, this router takes a LOT of computer adjustments and networking know-how before you can ever get this thing to work on a semi-consistent basis.First - take a good LONG look at the construction of your house. has anyone EVER, in the past, used lead paint on your walls? wireless will not work. Are your walls possibly made of plaster? wireless will not work. Do you have walls of any type in your house? wireless will not work. Second - I have had this product for a year now and have made roughly 57 calls to linksys and no one has been able to help me make it work outside of the room it is installed in, which defeats the purpose of wireless.I have seen other reviews mention this fact and also mention the following: 99% of linksys "customer service" representatives are reading from a script and do not actually have any idea how to fix any problems you have. typically they will have you unplug everything a few times, hit a lot of "reset" buttons and then inform you that your computer is "unusual".  So do NOT buy this thing if you don't think you can organize a home network by yourself.</review>

<review id="6350">I've had this computer for two days. Up until now I was generally pleased with it except for the limited solid state C: drive size (4 gb). I am constantly having to clean up the files on the drive so I don't get low memory messages. They definitely need to upgrade the size of this drive.However, the reason for the one star rating is a quality issue. One of the three USB ports doesn't work. When I called technical support, after waiting a very long time, the best solution the tech could suggest was to reload the operating system. This is after I have spent most of two days updating drivers, installing software, etc. He said he didn't really think it was very likely that would work anyway. If it doesn't, I have to call and get an RMA and pay to send the unit in to them. Who knows how long it will take to get it back?I would not recommend that anyone buy this product due to quality issues.</review>

<review id="6351">Wish I had purchased the other trimmer at another site, for $20 more that cut when you pushed the on button. This Panasonic needs to be 'canned'. This one must be a fan for knats, it doesn't trim. The light feature could be nice, if an engineer would have designed it instead of Helen Keller. I was, and am, disappointed and would find a better product in using my 4 year older trimmer with no light, or wet/dry feature. Don't purchase.</review>

<review id="6352">I shop frequently at Amazon and am a very satisfied customer. I usually read and follow the reviews but this time I ignored the poor reviews because I had owned another Panasonic model Nose and ear trimmer and it worked just fine. The ER421KC is unfortunately lousy and the most absurd part is the light which does nothing. I can not believe how bad this item really is. The unit does not trim properly, operates too slow for comfort and swift trimming, does not do a good job of it and all the while, the silly dot of light reflects on your face far from the area that you are trying to trim. If I had not wasted my money buying this, I would think of this as a funny joke on me. Buyer beware, unless, of course, you have the sense of humor that I sorely lack.</review>

<review id="6353">You come to expect a certain level of quality and efficacy of products from major name brands.  This is the first item I have bought in years from such a major brand that is completely useless, to the point that I complained to Philips Norelco, and am about to throw it in the trash if they won't accept a refund.  For starters, the blades are dull and poorly positioned so as to unenthusiastically nibble at hair, rather than actually *cut* it.  Secondly, the build quality is horrible.  The length attachments snap on, but are nearly impossible to remove;  and a forcible attempt to do so actually ejects the whole razor "cartridge".  The same thing happens when you tap it against the sink to disperse clogged hair.  The cutting angles are awkward, it is loud and buzzy, and it doesn't hold a charge.  In fact, the only good thing I can say about it is that it looks kind of slick.  To sum it up:  the Bodygroom is horribly ineffective, and I would not recommend it under any circumstances.</review>

<review id="6354">This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) (DVD)      I'm not going to say "I'm a huge fan" or "I'm a child of the 80s" because all that is irrelevant. A bad film is a bad film, straight up! Why does a Transformers film need stupid teenagers who wear band shirts running around trying to get laid? WHY? What does it add to the story, other than crude jokes and an excuse to tilt up and down some hot chick's midriff? How about NOTHING! This film should have just been Transformers and the military, that's what we want to see, not bodily fluids being unleashed and cheap sex references so MTV-martyrs can get a laugh! Why all the GM advertising? Are the kids who are going to bug their parents to buy them all the toys going to buy cars after the movie ends, too? Good lord! So Megatron can survive deep space, which is more frigid than we can imagine, but he can't sustain himself in a glacier? Wow Bay, you are so talented! Ever notice a similar theme in every Michael Bay film, that of a Caucasian loser (except the Bad Boys films) trying so hard to score with a few action sequences thrown in? I'm officially boycotting any film with his name attached to it for life. I had my doubts about this, and sure as heck, they manifested before my eyes!</review>

<review id="6355">The title of this item is "320GB My Passport Essential 2.5IN Blue".  But the description clearly states that the item is ONLY 250GB of storage space.  I almost purchased this item because it was listed as close to $30.00 less expensive than another Western Digital 320GB.  I figured it was less expensive because the color Blue was in less demand. Instead it is because it is a totally different product with fewer gigabytes of storage.  READ UP BEFORE YOU OPEN UP (your wallet that is).</review>

<review id="6360">I've wanted this coffee maker for years because of it's sleek design and the convenience of grinding and brewing at the same time but OH and am I disappointed. I should have read the other reviews on this site because I definitely agree that the grinder is a piece of crap - the ground coffee gets clumped up inside of the grinder due to condensation, not all of the beans get ground, you can't see when you're filling the water container, there are WAY too many parts that are difficult to dismantle and the clean up is a big pain... and to top it all off - the coffee tastes watered down and flavorless. I wish I could return this coffee maker but instead I think I might have to just throw it away and go back to using the good ole $20 French press!</review>

<review id="6362">I bought the 2 MB version of this device for about $65, and it was defective upon arrival. After a lot of hassle, they gave a RMA to send it in for repair. It was in repair for two months and finally I got it back with a note saying simply: "Tested" I copied about 5 small files to it and I thought it might be working. Later I delected the files and now I can no longer write to it at all. I tried on another laptop computer and same problem. I have lots of cheap USB flash memory modules that all work perfectly. Of course, meanwhile the price has dropped by 50% and I have yet to get any use out it. The lifetime warranty goes like this: It will take your entire lifetime to get a working device. I strongly advise you to avoid this product brand entirely. The device is garbage and the warranty is worthless because you just get more garbage after waiting another couple of months. Or maybe you enjoy being passed around customer service for an hour and interrogated as if you are stupid. I am an electrical engineer with 12 patents. You just stick it in the hole and write files to it. How hard can it be?</review>

<review id="6365">Like so many I was eagerly anticipating the release of Breaking Dawn, the fourth installment of Stephenie Meyer's Twilight saga. After attending a midnight release party. I got home and quickly tore the book open eagerly awaiting whatever the book would hold. However, after delving further into the book my excitement transformed into a combination of shock, horror and disgust. THIS is what we were waiting for!??I kept waiting to find the page that said just kidding,but found nothing but a cruel joke! There were so many options available, and this is what she chose? Why? In a interview in Entertainment Weekly Meyers said she knew she wasn't going to make everyone happy, and we knew that fans of Jacob were going to  disappointed ( lets be honest he really never had a chance to win Bella's love). Instead of forever dividing us, I feel that she untied us in the total collapse of Breaking Dawn.  This was never meant to be a "happy ever after.  Even those who wanted Bella to choose Edward, wanted her to lose something in the process. (I.E. Her parents, her friends, her ability to have children.) The series as a whole was centered around this. The utter failure of Breaking Dawn is that it gives Bella Edward and it allows her to keep everything she was going to give up.The general consensus among Twilight fans was that Jacob Black didn't deserve anything out of this. Yes, he did call the Cullen's names (which was immature.) However, through the course of the series he has been the one character who never truly wavered from his ideals. He shows this in Breaking Dawn by siding with the Cullens over his pack. Effectively setting aside his own nature for the good of Bella. As such, he deserved an appropriate ending to his story. What we get, however, is a creepy incestuous twist. Namely, Jacob imprinting on Bella and Edward's daughter. How could anyone think this was a good idea? in order for Stephenie Meyer to get her happy ending he gets forced into the most disturbing romantic relationship this side of Hamlet.The forced Happy Ending is this book's greatest flaw. I would have been able to stomach some of the book's more idiotic turns (of which there are many) if it stayed true to the central crux of the series. Namely, the complexities of romantic relationships and the impact of choice and consequences in life. Instead we have an utterly pointless coming-of-age story in which the only strong permeating theme is embracing a life of domesticity, and that true happiness comes through procreation and maternal devotion.Like it or not, there have been many comparisons made between the Twilight saga and J.K. Rowling's masterful Harry Potter series. While both series have been enormously successful. the difference is that Rowling, unlike Meyer, has the ability to end  a series in a way that is true to the story that came before it. In years to come, when i think of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. I will think of the inspiring, epic and creative Odyssey that Rowling imparted on us. When I think of Breaking Dawn, I will only think of bad vampire seman jokes.So, Ms. Meyer. I've read the works of J.K Rowling; and you madem, are no J.K Rowling.Nor will you ever be.</review>

<review id="6368">I am a PhD student. I purchased this product 3 weeks ago to minimize the number of times that I would need to bike to campus with my laptop - instead, the plan went, I would be able to access all of the files on my laptop on a university computer through my WD external harddrive. Whendevising this plan, I assumed an external hard-drive would be as dependable as their internal counterparts or even a 'thumb drive'.Eeek! The product boasts a certain encryption feature that 'protects'the content of your files during the 'syncing' process. My experience,though, is that the encryption/syncing process regularly corrupts my worddocuments. I now find myself at the library unable to work because"synchronization was unable to transfer your data successfully". Thisisn't the first time (nor the only problem). What's more alarming isthat the original files on my laptop become 'corrupted' as well/are nolonger accessible. With my WD external hard drive, I expect to lose 1 important file a week do to 'synchronization errors'(either on my laptop or on the WD). It just so happens that on this week, I lost two files in two consecutive days. Both of which important. I find the product unreliable. I find WD borderline irresponsible for putting this technology onto the market before its ready. I would stick with thumb drives which, in my last four years of using those, have never once given me trouble.</review>

Well folks, after a month of using it, I'm putting 2003 back on with the 2007 compatibility upgrade, and kicking this to the curb.Office 2007 is a MAJOR step backwords in terms of ease and usability, and a big steaming pile of junk.  Gone is the Toolbar, now replaced by the inane "Ribbon".  I can click back and forth all day long without finding the menu option I want.  Customize it?  Yeah, right.Tasks that used to be so simple, such as Edit -> Paste Special... I give up, where is it?  I even struggled to find "Save As", and had to go to Google to find out.Excel doesn't fare much better -- I still haven't found out how to pull up the Drawing toolbar and cursor like in 2003, and frankly, I don't care anymore.Whenever the inevitable Office 2010 or 2015 comes out, hopefully Microsoft will learn from their mistakes, and go back to the old menu system.  I know I have.</review>

<review id="6375">All you really need to do is read M.L. "A Person Who Cares About Something"'s review, which can be found amongst the 1-Stars. While it may be a little lengthy for an Amazon review, I think the reviewer represents a keen attention to detail that is important when considering a cultural artifact that is so exorbitantly and blindly cherished.   Some of my favorite characters in literature are murderous, deranged, abusive or at least morally-questionable people. Even while these characters are often protagonists, it is clear that the authors' intents are not to create exemplary figures. In the case of Isabella "Bella" Swan, the reader is presented with a hateful protagonist whose existence is ostensibly worth rooting for. Though not originally, I grew to hate Bella Swan. After finishing the last Twilight book, I hated her even more because Stephanie Meyer WANTS me to like her. So what kind of girl is Bella? She's a beautiful girl who knows she's beautiful but laces her pride in a thick veil of false humility by pretending that she doesn't know, that she doesn't understand why annoying boys keep latching onto her. Bella's also, we are to understand, very intelligent and has an affinity for Shakespeare and Bronte. Now, while the blazing blindness of first love admittedly renders all sensibility null and void, it does not obliterate the spaces in our minds that nurture our favorite lines and scenes from literature; it does not destroy our ability to recognize the correlation of scenes from our own lives to the scenes of our favorite dramas; it does not hinder us from making at least SOME vocal or internalized reference worth noting. Meyer simply tells us that Bella is so freaking awesome and well-rounded of a person, but never backs it up in her character development--Bella never actively manifests the person we're all supposed to just understand she is. Instead, she dissolves, book by book, into a symbolic vampire who feeds off and/or willingly sustains the needs, lust, obliviousness and jealousy of others. Bella becomes a simpler and simpler photocopy of the person Meyer presents us with in the first book. Meyer betrays and fouls Bella's original individuality (her patience, need for solitude and unwillingness to conform to society's popular trends) by turning her into a person whose intellectual curiosity and rationality are drowned by puppy-love. While I don't believe that a young adult necessarily throws away his/her life in deciding to marry/impregnate at an earlier-than-average age (as that choice may be just as valuable as any other), Bella's development is non-linear when considering the earlier reserve and foresight that she presented in Twilight. Bella doesn't marry a man with which she finds any kind of emotional and intellectual compatibility (none of Edward and Bella's conversations imply any true interest in each other's thoughts other than a surface-level obsession with their monovalent "love")--she marries a rockstar that she just can't keep her eyes off of. Furthermore, Bella's wreckless honeymoon is an inconsistent personality-point that I could never reconcile. Every valuable parcel of Bella's personality and sense of self-awareness begins to degenerate in those scenes (and what a horribly drawn out affair that was--an isolated island in the middle of an ocean, and with hired help! Puh-lease!). I don't blame anyone for capitulating to the whims of love, or even for choosing immortality over predictable mortality. But a person as assumedly intelligent and complex as Bella should naturally have more frequent and philosophical thoughts and conversations about the implication of vampire life than "does a vampire have a soul?" Give me a f-----g break! Bella and Edward never even contemplate what the word "soul" even means! It's just some saccharine notion of fate that's decided over so swiftly that it seems as if Bella never really considered her role in her OWN life at any lucid moment! Are these shallow, stunted and hapzard spiritual meanderings supposed to justify Meyer's self-congratulatory emissions concerning her Mormonism and how its influenced her writing?  Here's some other reasons why I hate the idea that I'm supposed to like Bella:--Bella just can't STAND driving that EMBARRASSING European sports car.--Bella just can't STAND spending one solitary moment away from Edward and let her own personality exist outside the shallow vaccuum of teenage martyrdom.--Bella is played out to be the ultimate victim in the Saga, torn between the men she loves, the future she wants, the spaces she wants to maintain between her father and ultimately her nonexistent mother. She just can't understand why everybody can't just get along! Considering this, Bella nearly abandons her father, Charlie, who Meyer de-bowels by having him demand that he NOT know the truth about Bella's life. Up until Breaking Dawn, Charlie is insistent upon being involved in Bella's life. Though he has no control over Bella's decisions, he illustrates a melancholy and aggressive interest in making sure that his daughter is making the right decisions. Charlie is ordinary, loving and flawed--which is why he was Meyers' most likable character. He was also the major victim in Meyer's Saga, though Meyer would never have you consider the notion. Charlie is repeatedly left in the dark; he is taken for granted; his worries about Bella are mocked by Meyer's persistent obsession with glorifying the vacuous relationship of Bella and Edward. Now sure, this happens to fathers all over the world at any given moment, but what's the ultimate point of Charlie's character if his primary curiosity about the world is totally ultimately negated? To Meyer, Charlie is ultimately just a good ol' police dad who likes to go fishin' and will totally lay supine around the idea that his daughter is no longer exactly "human." By book 4, we are to believe that Charlie swiftly absorbs the notion that his world is an absurd simulacra.  --Bella named her baby "Renesmee" (lame and artless considering Bella's previous penchant for eloquent poetry and English literature).--Bella has a vampire superpower! (lame lame lame)....Which is something I hated about the culmination of the Saga itself--vampire superpowers. I mean, I know that typically vampires, in a literary sense, have sorts of extraordinary earthly talents, but the way Meyers brings all these exotic vampires together with all their unique and superduper powers turns her story into a goth videogame. Which supervampire would you like to play as?! Can you raise Bella's shield to a 10-level before Jane permeates Edward with her thought-flames of pain?!I liked Jacob until his persistent love of Bella became repulsive. It was repulsive because Bella is ultimately a shallow idol who is reticent when she shines most brightly with self-admiration. Twilight was an MTV movie because it was produced from MTV books. All the vampires are beautiful because it is intrinsic to their physiology, according to the Laws. If Bella and Edward weren't implicatively beautiful, their characters would retain not even an ounce of superficial fidelity. They have nothing valuable to offer the world. Some other things I hated about this series:--Am I supposed to give a crap that Meyer just loveloveloves the band Muse?? A book should stand on it's own without falsely playful comments about what's ALWAYS JUST ALWAYS on the author's IPOD. I can understand dedications, but throwing out band names is just a form of self-flattery. It's freaking embarrassing. "I like Muse, you young hip kids, so you should too! Muse totally expresses my sense of apocalyptic desperation, and they can for you too!" Yeah, well I like the sound that gasoline pumps make when they're clicking away!--Having Bella decide to become a vampire was predictable. I think it would have been much more interesting if Bella had ultimately not decided to join the vampire world, had decided to maintain the complex and sacrificial human story. Also, taking a character who, even on a subconscious level, can't reconcile the fact that they are beautiful and intelligent, and making them extraordinarily beautiful and agile, is completely loathsome and turns a protagonist into an idolic image of perfection. While Meyer might argue that Bella is not perfect because of all the pain she must endure, her fate, her destiny is perfect--her suffering is perfect and untapped by the universally evident incompleteness of the human experience.  --What's with the short prologues between major sections of the books that really don't correlate with any following scenes--even on an abstract level? Freaking LAME, people. --What's with blatantly citing "email" and actual automobile names, actual physical destinations, etc., but painfully dodging the name of the modern band that Phil burned onto CD for Bella? So mysterious!!! What angst-ridden screamo band could Bella be listening to???--And really--what's with VAMPIRES???!!!</review>

Lo and behold I have some problems, check forums and everyone is complaining about it. Twist starts to fail and there is no calibration to compensate as everyone here points out. Even the software on their site to add dead zones does not work, at least with XP! The main trigger is now failing also - after just 2 weeks! Don't buy this one, you'll regret it.</review>

<review id="6381">This fountain will work great for about the first year of use.  Mine "lasted" a full year due to being continuously filled with water and cleaned.  The main issue is the fountain's cheap motor that drives the impeller for the pump.  After the motor wears out, you have to manually start the motor running by using your finger to "spin" it.  This is not an easy task since the impeller is located behind the flow adjuster - and does require you to remove the back verticle structure.  A better quality - Brushless (I am assuming the motor is a brush style motor from the early "death"), ball bearing motor would solve this issue.  For a few more dollars, you would get many more years use out of this product.Apparently someone in management [at drinkwell] who does not understand generators/motors (basically the same) decided to use the current, cheap motor.  On the other hand, maybe they did, causing the device to fail early, thus forcing the purchaser to buy a new fountain far more often.Also from my experience in Plastic Injection molding Industry, they used a very cheap plastic that gets dirty and stained far to fast.  They should have used a higher quality stain resistant plastic - at least for the bowl portion of the device.  There are plenty of choices out there, and the cost of better materials would be minimal.</review>

<review id="6382">Like it says in the review title, I really WANT to like this drive. Unfortunately, I can't. I don't. And I probably won't. Ever. Why?I bought one of these from another vendor (sorry Amazon, their price was better). I installed the drive on my 24" aluminum iMac (which I DID buy from Amazon, good job, guys). The drive recognized fine on firewire 800, and I set Time Machine to use it for backups.Then the problems started. The drive would "freeze" when it went into suspend mode, and it wouldn't come back. OS X is too stupid to stop trying to access a "dead" drive, so the suspended/frozen drive would hang the system. The only solution was to power down the drive (if possible), or remove the firewire cable. Worse, sometimes the drive wouldn't power down using the power button, so I had to pull the power cord. NOT good.Once the frozen drive was out of the firewire chain, the OS would recover semi-gracefully, with a "Device Removal" error. I figured it was a fluke, so I put the drive first in the firewire chain. No luck. Then I changed cables. No luck. Okay, try the drive as the ONLY firewire drive. No luck. It would still freeze, and still hang the system.So, I figured I just had a defective drive. No problem. I already had another on order, so I sent the first back to the vendor and waited for the second to arrive.Same problems with the second drive. I used every connection available: firewire 800, firewire 400, and even USB (iMac's don't come with eSATA, so I don't know if it's a problem too). No luck with any connection, OR any cable (I have several available, which work with other drives). The My Book Studio drive still hangs AT LEAST once a day, usually several times.So the second drive is going back for a refund, and I'm going to call the other vendor and just have them refund my money for the "defective" drive already in transit as a return.Now, why do I want to like this drive?Pros:- It's good-looking- It's quiet (because it's fanless)- Quadruple interface (nice!)- It's smallCons:- It just doesn't work... do I really need any MORE cons?When the drive started giving me problems, I went looking for a solution (updated firmware, updated Button Manager software, SOMETHING). I found several people on the Apple Discussion Forums with the same problem, which made me realize that the drive itself was the issue.Google for "my book studio freeze" and you can read the Apple Support discussion, which will lead you to more problem discussions.That being said, I love Western Digital, and they're my first choice for external drives. I just think they have some MAJOR teething pains with the My Book Studio line. And since other Mac users love them, I suspect that WD Studio drives simply don't like the new iMacs. But since I spent $2000 on my computer, and $200 on the drive, the drive is the one that gets returned. Sorry, WD.If you want a good, reliable drive for your iMac, I've had lots of luck with LaCie, and I've heard really good things about OWC drives. But if you're a tried-and-true WD fan... stay away from THIS drive.</review>

<review id="6385">I've used Turbo Tax Basic for years but thought I'd save ten bucks and try Tax Cut Basic.  Penny wise, pound foolish.  If you really have a simple return, Tax Cut will be fine, but if you expect to easily download financial data from banks, investment firms, etc. you will not be happy.  Turbo Tax Basic does and now I've had to go back to it.The deduction program included is a beta version and is full of bugs, so worthless.</review>

<review id="6386">After 10 months of owning this item (about 5 uses), its battery is unable to hold a charge. Even when the battery was in new condition, the unit wouldn't last for more than 45 minutes of shaving. For an entire body touch-up, one might need a trimmer with that can actually last an entire trim or shave. Also, the unit is made of flimsy plastic, which cuts down on weight but also decreases durability. And though I've never exposed the trimmer to shower conditions, I doubt it would hold up, despite its being touted as "wet/dry." The no-guard foil option up to a #1 guard are close enough to nick skin and draw blood, so watch out!Bottom line: Look elsewhere when considering a male body hair trimmer.</review>

<review id="6388">I bought this keyboard for my brother as a Christmas gift. We found out after plugging it in that the W A S and D keys did not work properly. He would have to push it 4-5 times before the letters would type, which is strange considering its a gaming keyboard and WASD are important gaming keys. So I returned it to Amazon and received another one, and the new one was wobbly! The plastic arm rest that came with it was not level and so the entire keyboard was unstable. I was very unhappy with this product, for the price that it costs I would except much better quality, and all in all I was very dissatisfied.</review>

<review id="6389">This review is from: Tropic Thunder (Video On Demand)      I had high hopes after seeing movie critics praise this film.

<review id="6390">There was only one word I could say when I finally finished this book.  It was "wow".  It was not a "WOW!!!" as in 'that book was the best ever!'  It was just a plain flat "wow", as in 'What in the world happened in this book?'  Too many things went wrong in this book. *SPOILERS BELOW*Renesmee.  Okay, Rosalie talked of wanting a baby, and Esme's story, and Bella seeing two kids she could of had with Jacob in a vision.  Stephenie Meyer called those foreshadowing to Bella having a baby.  I would guess that 99% of the fan base took all that as trying to get Bella to see just exactly what she would be giving up, sacrificing, to be with Edward.  Apparently not.  Edward has "special venom", so no sacrifices there.  And Bella's now totally okay and unaffected by drinking blood through a straw?  I'm sorry, but is this the same Bella that is super sensitive to blood and fainted in the Biology blood-typing class from just getting a whiff of blood?  Nope.  The whole chewing through the uterus.....that was gross.  And Jacob imprinting on Renesmee?  *sighs*  Wow. Just about all of the characters were out of character.  Especially Edward.  Asking Jacob to sleep with Bella so she could have a 'normal' baby was just wrong and totally not Edward.  And does anyone know what happened to Esme?  She was practically non-existent in the book.  Emmett was the only Cullen I enjoyed in the book and even he wasn't in it enough.The Volturi.  Stephenie did a great job building the suspense and had me on the edge of my seat.  And then, I was bored to tears by all the talking that happened between the two sides.   Bella gets everything she wanted and doesn't have to give up anything or make much sacrifice (a baby, Charlie, Jacob).....which we were led to believe she would end up doing, and she is apparently super duper special and gets to completely skip the newborn vamp stage and save everyone.  ETA:  Even then Bella was not the one who did the saving.  It was Alice!!  What would have happened if Alice had not shown up with the other 'half-breed'.  *sighs*  We'll never know, because SM was afraid to go to battle.But, there were a few things I did enjoy.First was Seth.  He was the most enjoyable character in the whole book.I liked some of the miscellaneous vamps that came about.  But not many of them.Jacob.  Now....I've never liked Jacob.  But I found myself liking him a bit in this book.  But even then, the only thing I liked about Jacob in this book was when Jacob broke off from Sam's pack and took on his role as Alpha in his own little pack.  Best moment for Jacob in the whole series, IMO.And the best moment of the whole book, was when Bella finally was able to show Edward her thoughts.  Sadly, it came at the very very end and I wish there had been more because that was when the Edward that I grew to love showed up.  I actually teared up at that part and was without a doubt the best Bella/Edward moment in the book, only because that was the Bella/Edward that SM created.  Not the completely out of character Edward/Bella that existed through the whole book.Unfortunately, the things I did enjoy were just not enough to make this book more enjoyable. Stephenie Meyer said she's a happy ending kind of gal.  She wasn't kidding.  But Bella getting everything was just too much of a happy ending and too much can ruin a story.  In this case, for me, it did.</review>

<review id="6391">I had previously owned a logitech digital extreme 3d. It broke down after several years of use. The twist on the stick failed.

<review id="6394">Don't ever buy this router. I changed my wireless router from Netgear to Linksys because my roommate took away his Netgear router. After careful thoughts and considering the big discount availbale in December 2006, I bought this router. It works fine untill I am alone on the network. When a couple or more of my friends come over to my apartment, it disconnects and we have to restart it every 15 minutes. I spent a lot of time on it changing its configuration settings. And I called Linksys support guys, even they could not solve the problem. At the end they concluded that the router is not working so they sent me the new router of the same model. But the problem is the same. Even I tried it with default factory settings. Whenever 2 or more wireless computers access the network, it goes down. Moreover, I have also confirmed that my modem (Motorolla SB5120) is perfectly fine because it works if I connect with it directly.</review>

<review id="6395">TurboTax is a good product but as the years go by and you learn to trust the the software, you get suckered into using "partner services" like Santa Barbara Bank and Trust that's bundled into the software.Because it's TurboTax, I trusted having my refund "rushed" through them for a fee - almost $50.Today, I'm notified that my refund has been released to them but I have to wait an additional 2 business days to get it deposited into my account. What a ripoff !! If this was clearly disclosed at the beginning, I would have made a better choice.</review>

<review id="6396">So I decided to get the CHI iron. Upon receiving the product, I decided it didn't look exactly like the one my hair stylist used. So obviously, I decided to return it. I looked everywhere for a return address and didn't find anything. So of course, I email NOCURLS. It took a few days for them to get back to me and when I did get a response, the answer was "what's the problem with the product". There was no greeting no nothing. SO of course I sent an email back saying that I needed the address to return the iron. It literally took an exchange of about 3 or 4 emails before I was provided with a return address. When I finally got the credit, the took 10% out. When I emailed why it was taken out, the email I got was "it was obvious you used it". So I returned an email and said, If I returned it, then why didn't you take out the 25% restocking fee that your policy reads. Of course I never received an email back. The fact of the matter is, this is an inferior product sold from a person's basement. DON'T BUY IT!!! besides, CHI will not guarantee the purchase of any CHI irons sold on amazon.</review>

<review id="6398">Unlike Quickbooks 2008 which works great, Quickbooks 2009 has serious flaws.  The bank reconciliation feature freezes causing one to have to close Quickbooks and reboot the computer.After rebooting it is necessary to go into control panel, find the printer you wish to use and reset it as default.  Then you must go to the Quickbooks "PDF printer" which Quickbooks 2009 automatically installed and delete any documents from the print que.The bank reconciliations you perform will not print because Quickbooks is structured to send them directly to this "virtual printer" device, which does not forward the document you wish to print to the real printer you have connected to your computer.  Quickbooks 2009 automatically resets your real printer to "non-default".  This causes great aggravation and slows down your work.Additionally, Intuit, has essentially isolated themselves from their customers by making it virtually impossible to reach a real person to talk to by telephone.  I strongly advise you to not upgrade to Quickbooks 2009 software.  Stay with one of the earlier versions.</review>

<review id="6399">This review is from: Australia (DVD)      Mother got this at the store. Thought it might be interesting since Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman and the others in this thing have great talent. This thing doesn't.Great scenery. Wonderful costuming. Great sets. Some of the gags in the scenes are comical and amusing. But every character in this thing is one form of badly played and most pathetic stereotype or another who barely gets two dimensional. Indeed one almost wants to scream Racism at how whites are portrayed. Love scenes completely impotent. Diologue or what passes  for it STINKS. What passes for 'action' can best be described as unimaginative, dragging, forced  or deliberate flop work. Acting clearly lacking. About as exciting as watching paint. If one wants to do a movie, this one should be studied over for how not to do one. If one wants to do a flop this is the Model to follow.Nicole Kidman plays a pompous full of herself money grubbing english auristocrat about as sexy and exciting as drab paint work and in need of a good thrashing which she never gets. She is so bad and so spoiled that she must be suspected to be the cause for her husband to move so far away to Australia to get away from her rather than 'the cows not of the animal variety' she attributes to him. Hugh Jackman for want of a better description plays some sort of ever brawling outback cowboy though he acts like a total outhouse cowclod. And then there are the big villeins, crock bait and crock shoes, who bring new meaning to Pathetic.Everybody else is so pathetic, the only reason the villeins do not their own hiss boo theme music or tie some lady to the train tracks for a train to cross  must be simply for want of any brains among the screne writers.One almost wishes for more action from the Japanese if for no reason than to put this thing out of our missery.Lots of Death scenes. All of them awful and pathetic. This is a turkey and a poor tourism  pitch.</review>

<review id="6402">My wife and I bought this from Amazon in mid December '04 and were quite impressed with its speed and ease of use. A couple of weeks ago, we discovered the maker was starting to kick off before the all the water had been passed out of the reservoir and into the basket. So, in order to make an entire pot of coffee, someone now has to stand there and keep turning it back on after it kicks off. We've contacted Zojirushi about the problem, but haven't heard back yet. When we checked other's reviews of this product, this switch problem now seems endemic with this maker. My hope is that Zojirushi, if it doesn't want to lose customers, provides a replacement without customers having to pay shipping costs, etc. to get a new maker. If we don't get a timely and cost-effective replacement, we're done with this brand for good, and I think Amazon should think twice about selling this maker.</review>

<review id="6412">I just can't recommend this router to anyone at the moment, esp. with some fundamental problems below:1. DHCP - If you have a dedicated DHCP server somewhere on the network, then forget about this router. The darn thing would still assign IPs even if you disable the DHCP function. It'd also send DHCPNACK with DHCP diabled.2. DHCP again - If you assign a DHCP range and assign them as static entries. It'd still assign those IPs to other machines.3. DDNS - Obviously the router doesn't keep track of the WAN IP changes and if you save the configuration a few times, it'd try to update the IP on the dynamic DNS server multiple times, causing the custom domain to be banned.4. Tech support - Not exactly the router's problem but if you have a support person who'd recommend connecting a cable modem to the LAN port to get around the DHCP problem, you're just not going to trust their tech support anymore.</review>

<review id="6413">5 stars *****---not 2**This is my very first laptop-or netbook-or mini-laptop.  I did alot of research before purchase.  My needs were simple. Small enough to take along that doesen't weigh you down, but with a screen big enough to see comfortably.  I was originally looking for a kimble reading device--decided a small computer would be more versatile for the same money, and it is.  I was also originally looking at its smaller brother- the 7 inch screen-  but then found this 10 inch big brother.  Perfect for my needs and gives a whole screen shot. I have the larger 6 cell battery that doesn't really give you 7 hrs of time, more realistically 4-5.  It reads e-books just like a sony or kimble, but can do everything a laptop can do as well, just a little bit bigger.  Not as powerful or as fast as a big laptop, but suits my needs to pick up e-mail, surf the net, research, plays music and videos,the speaker is not bad for a little thing, but for great sound just plug in headphones. Not a  loud fan.  I don't even notice it and I'm bothered by ticking clocks,and sounds like that in the background.  The one I have has 80 gigabytes of hard drive, bluetooth and wireless wifi which works off my husbands wireless modem and public wifi.  I have had this for 2 months, and have only used less than 40 gigs of memory.  You can add an external Hard drive.  The only drawback is no slot for cd or dvd.  You can get an external one though.I'm very happy with my purchase.  No regrets.                    5 stars*****---not 2**</review>

<review id="6415">I have had my Linksys router for 3 years.  I also had to get a bridge to extend the range because it couldn't go through walls very well. I had to call them a lot because sometimes the bridge or router somehow lost the address.They used to have free support until just very recently. My beef is with the cost of support.  3.99 a minute. ( I don't know if that includes listening for many minutes to bad music.) You can get 3 months support for $199, 6 months for $299 or 1 year for $499!!!  I can tell you I spent many hours talking to tech support so I would go elsewhere.</review>

<review id="6416">One of the ways an author creates a believable scenario, believable characters, and believable stories, is by letting the characters take control.  Authors like Elmore Leonard are big proponents of this practice - don't try to force characters into situations they wouldn't be caught dead in, and don't try to force emotions onto them.  The second the author does that is the second the story is ruined and becomes completely unbelievable and impossible to relate to.This mistake is what Meyers did.  It is obvious while reading the story that she forced the characters to do exactly what SHE wanted, and not what they would have done.  Part of the draw of the other books is that you could really imagine these characters there with you; they had concrete personalities and opinions.  I felt like Meyers tried to force a lot of her personal ideals and beliefs onto the characters, rather than thinking about what Bella would do, or what Edward would do.  At times I couldn't even tell the difference between Bella, Edward, or Jacob.  The characters lost almost everything unique about them aside from physical abilities and traits.Rather than being truly about the story, Meyers wrote what she wanted her readers to believe.  Perhaps in a different story, this would have been fine.  But by forcing the characters to act and behave in ways she wanted, she stunted the possibilities that this series had for further growth in the minds of its fans.</review>

<review id="6418">I purchased my Cuisinart GR-4 Griddler on November 11th, 2006. I mostly eat out, being a travelling sales rep, so on the rare chance I do get to cook at home (I love making Panini sandwiches and burgers) and this seemed to me the ideal package.. a very sturdy looking construction, a name I trust and great looks.However, after less than half a dozen uses, the right hinge snapped. Broke cleanly off while I was LIFTING the upper plate away using the top handle, and this was a real dangerous issue. The right half of the top of the griddler fell down onto the burgers I was cooking and flung grease everywhere. Upon later inspection, the hinge was constructed from the cheapest cast aluminum I've ever seen used in an appliance, I'm telling you it is cheaper than pot-metal. With the sturdy over-all construction of the GR-4 Griddler, this left me extremely displeased, as the only cheap materials were used where it mattered most, where there is stress placed on the hinges. I predict that I'm not going to be the only one experiencing this problem.</review>

<review id="6419">As has been mentioned on here and other sites (Tiger, New Egg, etc) this drive is from a great company with a great history, but this LEMON POS has gotta be weeks from being recalled.Mine worked great under OSX with MacFUSE/NTFS-3G and XP for about 2 weeks. Then the little punk died along with 200gig or so of my data. The disk didn't move off my desk the entire time, no drops, knocks or otherwise.I love Seagate and I really love their FreeAgent drives (which is why I bought this even after reading the negative reviews here and elsewhere) but this model is a LEMON! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DRIVE! There's a reason other reviews have mentioned instant RMAs, these things have a high failure rate - hence the no questions asked returns.Seagate: Recall this POS and reissue a new model with these issues fixed.

The "warranty" is essentially worthless.I bought an ASUS Eee PC 900HA for my wife prior to Christmas. I had  loaded all the 30 plus updates from Microsoft as well as a licensed copy of MS Office and a few apps that we commonly use. The netbook was set aside for a month after Christmas and then used. The first issue noted was that "hibernate" mode didn't work when closing the cover. On inspection it was found that the computer crashed when closing the cover, unresponsive with video "hash" displayed. The second issue noted was Word "freezing" for over ten minutes when a largish, heavily edited document was loaded. The computer would become unresponsive and require a reboot.The third issue was a Java app that initially worked well, then stopped working for no apparent reason (DVArchive, which I have used for years on everything from a P1 to my current quadcore). I restored the machine through Windows, reloaded everything, and the issues persisted. After contacting tech support I mailed the machine at my own cost for repair. It was sent back with the note "machine ran for 30 minutes could not duplicate customer complaints". I booted it up, closed the cover, waited a bit, opened it, and guess what? Crash, unresponsive, video "hash" displayed.Well, the lesson is you get what you pay for. No surprise.</review>

<review id="6422">I am a big user of voice recognition.  I have used Dragon Speak since the 90's when following a stroke, and having temporarily lost the ability to type,  I used it for dictating an academic book.  Unfortunately I have found V. 10 less accurate than previous versions. I can not get it to learn unusual or new words as well either.  After 6 months of use, I am disappointed.  Will contintue to use it, but I spend a lot of time correcting the same mistakes.</review>

<review id="6423">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      I loved the movie - don't get me wrong. Warner Brothers are hacks though!!! I bought the DVD and then I have to pay $1.99 to get the digital copy?!?!?!?!? Take a lesson from Disney you momney-grubbing idiots; Prince Caspian was free!!!!!! Oh and in the TINY TINY wording below - "not compatible with Ipods". WHAT?!?!?! The most popular piece of technology in years and it's not compatible??? I literally never write negative reviews; if I don't like something I don't feel the need to stomp on someone's artistic efforts, but this is downright deplorable!!!!</review>

<review id="6424">I had a Sandisk 4gig and it worked awesome but needed more space so I got the Transcend and at first it worked like a charm. I even bragged about it to my co-workers about the size and speed but a couple days ago it kept saying it was a read only disk so I couldn't put anything on it or erase anything on it. I had the IT guy looked at it and he searched the web and any utilities but couldn't find nothing. He suggested I format it. I transfered whatever was on my flash drive and then tried to format it. Tried using Windows and another formatting program but it wouldn't do it. Went to Transcends web site and used their download programs to format it. Well it formatted it but when I stuck it in my laptop it wanted to format it since it was new and still wouldn't cause of the read only. Grrrr. Submitted a ticket on their site several days ago and still waiting. Drive works great when it's working but kinda getting frustrating</review>

<review id="6428">Last season (2.0) saw the beginning of the "Pegasus" trilogy ending with the first episode "Pegasus". This season (2.5) includes an extended cut of "Pegasus" and moves on to the following two episodes "Resurrection Ship, Parts I & II". The trilogy started off so well with "Pegasus" and even the first part of "Resurrection Ship" wasn't bad, but part two is when things start to fall apart. The only episodes worth watching in this season (2.5) is the last four episodes, and maybe even the the first few, but most of them were crap! Crappy plots and no real action. Disappointing.</review>

<review id="6429">I used my first WaterPik for 7 years and it worked perfectly until it just plain wore out.  After 4 uses,this one stopped working, the motor would only buzz.

<review id="6430">The pedometer seems to be pretty accurate although it would have been nice to have 2 stride modes (walk, run) to accurately track mileage.

<review id="6431">Sadly, my router doesn't work all the time. When it's running correctly and I get a wireless-N connection from my laptop to it, speeds can be in 70-100 Mbps range, I'm very pleased. Unfortunately, it often loses it's IP address. It's relatively easy for me to correct if I'm wired to it, but it's annoying to have to use a wireless router mostly in wired mode. I may replace it if I there isn't a firmware solution soon.</review>

<review id="6432">I would not reccommend this one to any people. I had suffered from so much inconvience. First is its speed, its max speed is 13MB/s, however my two years old 40GB portable hard drive is about 20MB/s, not even mention nowadays portable hard drive can easily exceeds 30MB/s. Then is its crappy backup software, I simply reformat this hard drive.Another big inconvience is the usb cord is way too short, only 15 inches, especially when you want to connect to desktop.I will not forgot to tell you it does not come with a carrying case, considering this hard drive is made of plastic.Actually you can find far better ones with faster speed, convienct usb connection, and come with all neccessary accessories, so why buy this one which only gives you trouble from time to time.</review>

<review id="6433">I tried this with my 12 year old son to get him to stop nail biting.  He stopped.  But it rubbed off his fingers on to other parts of his hand or face so he ended up tasting it even if he was not biting his nails.  When that happened he refused to keep using it.</review>

<review id="6434">Here is my mini review of high end mice I've tried recently.Razer Lachesis 4000 dpi Laser Gaming Mous--Banshee Blue (4000 DPI, 9 buttons):  This is the first mouse that gave me actual pain my my fingers and palm after just a couple of hours use and it has just about the worst ergonomics of any mouse I've ever used.  The side buttons are in a very inconvinient location.  In first person shooters you'll constantly be accidentally clicking either side's buttons since they're in the area where you grip the mouse (they're designed so you need to put "extra" pressure in the grip to click them).  The laser itself is pretty decent at 4000 DPI, but it is placed in the middle of the mouse instead of closer to the front, so you basically need to move the whole mouse to aim instead of the regular first person shooter "tilting the front of the mouse" aiming.  Be sure to go to their web site and use the updated drivers and firmware or you'll see a lot of "mouse jumping" problems even when you're not touching the mouse.  Also I noticed the mouse buttons would register as "up" as I was turning sometimes with the mouse button down (such as a Heavy in TF2 spinning his gun using the side button, which is annoying as heck).  There is also no on-mouse DPI display so there's no way to know which DPI setting you're at (one of the five DPI settings you're forced into).  Anyone had any good experience with this mouse?Logitech G9 Laser Mouse (3200 DPI, 7 buttons, weights, two grip types):  I used this mouse for a bit less than a year and it is by far my favorite mouse.  One problem is the connector between the mouse and cord eventually went bad and then the mouse had connection issues (Google this for more information).  Other than that, it has by far the best tracking and button location of any mouse I've used.  I like that the DPI switching is under the left mouse button and it is easy to tell what DPI level I currently am at.  Highly recommended!Logitech 931375-0403 G7 Laser Cordless Mouse Black (2000 DPI), Logitech NEW G5 Laser Mouse (2000 DPI) and Logitech MX518 Gaming Optical Mouse - Metal (1800 DPI): If you can't afford the G9, the models to the left are similarly good.  I've used and like them, but they all had tracking accuracy loss over time and needed to be replaced (generally after about 6 to 8 months of every day gaming 4+ hours a day).  None of the older models have the high 3200 DPI laser, but the G5/G7 have switchable DPI levels and generally feel good and are ergonomically nice for using over long periods of time.OCZ OCZMSDMXD Dominatrix Laser Gaming Mouse/MSI GS-501/Cyber Snipa Stinger (3200 DPI, 7 buttons, weights):  Very good for the price (one of the cheapest high end gaming grade mice).  The button locations are good and so is the feel of the mouse.  The default drivers that come with the mouse don't work with games well.  You'll have to download the newer ones from their web site and do some special settings for your games to register the side buttons as MOUSE4 and MOUSE5.  Highly recommended (drivers could use some work though).Ideazon Reaper Edge Gaming Mouse - 3200 DPI (3200 DPI, 6 buttons):  It's a decent mouse except for the side buttons.  The bottom side button is under a nub that is a bit annoying to reach in the middle of a first person shooter fight.  The top side button is a little nicer to reach and decent to use for knocking zombies off yourself in L4D.  The wheel is annoying since sometimes as you scroll it seems to click without putting much pressure on it (which is annoying if you have something bound to MOUSE3 and you just wanted to scroll the mouse wheel).  Also, it would have been nice to have two DPI buttons instead of the one (easier to "go to sniper mode"/"go to regular mode").  Currently the DPI button toggles between 5 different DPI levels one at a time and there isn't a way just to use less than that (I'd prefer just two for the above scenario...).  I wouldn't recommend this mouse in it's current form.As with any mousing, be sure to have a good quality mouse pad that doesn't need to be replaced (I used to replace those 3M Precise mouse pads about every month heh).  I've been using a fUnc sUrface 1030, but there are a lot of newer ones out there now.  Just be sure it's something you can soap wash and you should be good to go (no foamy or cloth pads).</review>

<review id="6435">From the program that's supposed to start automatically when you plug it into your computer's USB port to the two software upgrades we tried to install per the instructions, NOTHING works.  We have an XP and a Vista laptop and this piece of junk locks them both up regularly,  When we called in to tech support, all they wanted me to do was hang up.

<review id="6437">I was a happy owner of a Flip Video camera, but lost it. I was going to reorder and saw this one, about $30-$40 more expensive, but it seemed to be an upgrade. I am so disappointed and unhappy, that I wasted time.  I have to return this and now order another Flip camera. The directions are sparse, I see nothing about how to erase anything.  There is supposed to be a focus, but I can't find it.  The 'joy stick' is made to be used by the fingers of the same children who go blind making oriental rugs.  I see that most of the positive reviews come from people who have some technical expertize. However, if you don't want to mess with this, just don't order this camera.  Try the Flip!However, this is going back as soon as possible and I am ordering my new Flip Recorder and giving them a very high review.  (I do publicity videos for small business people and they are amazed at the quality that comes from that little Flip Video camera)</review>

<review id="6438">With Windows Vista Home Premium this device could not be found. No software helped, and no customer support response.Returned and Bought a linksys usb adapter.</review>

<review id="6439">It initially connected fine and I backed up my data.  After powering down the DELL XPS M1330 laptop powering back up it would not show up as a drive even though after checking in hardware manager it showed up under usb devices.  After calling Western Digital and Dell and spending hours with tech support we were unable to get the hard drive working with Vista.  I sent it back for a refund.  I also experienced issues with Vista using a 1TB Seagate drive that I purchased prior to the Western Digital.  It would not recognize the drive after reboot unless I power cycled the Seagate drive.  I returned that drive prior to purchasing the Western Digital.  I own a 160 GB external that I made by removing the internal 160 GB drive from an old computer and buying a case for.  It works every time with 0 issues.  The problem is the drive has been making noises and will die soon which is why I am trying to replace my drive.  If anyone can recommend a good external 1 TB drive that actually works consistently with Vista, please do.</review>

<review id="6440">I've wanted to purchase this model for a while now, but have been waiting for the plastic gearbox issue to be resolved.  I don't want to purchase an expensive item which will likely break.  Yes, I would like to make bread.I spoke with KA customer service this morning to inquire if this model is now being manufactured with the metal gear box, or if it's the same old "we're going to save a $1 per unit by using this plastic gear box".  I received a verbal, pre-constructed, corporate answer about how it doesn't matter if the gearbox is plastic or metal because KA stands behind this product, bla bla bla.  I told her it mattered to me and I couldn't feel good about doing business with KA without knowing what I'm getting.  She then proceeded to tell me that she doesn't know if they will ever go to a metal gearbox, but if they do there will be no way for me to know if I was buying one with a plastic or metal gearbox because some retailers have existing stock, bla bla bla.  Then, I asked her a point blank question, "Ma'am (I live in TN), is KA currently producing this item with a plastic or metal gearbox?  I'm not asking about anything or anyone else.  I just want to know if the current production is with a plastic or metal gearbox."  She said she had no idea and we then sat silently for a moment.  STILL trying to pull the answer out of her, I asked her if there was anyone there she could ask who might be able to find out the answer to my question.  She said she'd ask her supervisor.  I was on hold for a few minutes, then she returned to tell me that the 600 is now being manufactured with the metal gearbox.  I asked her what serial numbers are now being produced and she said there is no way to tell, and there is no way for me to know if I was buying a unit with the plastic or metal gearbox.I give this model two starts because it (purportedly) is now being manufactured with the metal gearbox.  I knock off three starts because KA gave me the runaround when I asked a straightforward question.  Additionally, KA is not interested in helping me purchase one with the metal gearbox.  Basically, I really can't be sure what I'm getting for almost $400.  Sure, I could buy it and return it, etc...but why should I have to waste all that time and energy?If anyone has a 600 with a metal gearbox I'd love to hear from them, know where they purchased it, when they purchased it, serial number, etc.</review>

<review id="6445">I've used TaxCut maybe four or five years. There was one year where they just dropped Mac OS. I dropped them and used Turbo Tax. Went back to TaxCut as I file Schedule C. Turbo Tax wouldn't include Schedule C for less than $85, their deluxe version. TaxCut half that price. Both apps have flaws. Often find they put amounts in wrong places (self employed health insurance on Sch A Med deduction and on 1040 self employed health insurace premiums - sorry, one or the other, not both).For a synopsis - read what I'm sending to online CHAT at TaxCut website.buggy software. Help becomes inaccessible. Msg is "Help setup will be complete momentarily." This happens frequently. I just opened the software tonight after three days of not using it and got that msg again. The workaround (from a good customer support person) is to throw away the Help file in App Support (Mac OS 10.5.6) and reinstall software. I don't mind doing it once, but now I'm having to do it at least six times, almost every time I use the software.#2 - had an issue with Vehicle Worksheet failing to add all amounts properly. Spun my wheels with a not so good customer support person who asked really dumb and basic questions. Said he would pass my case along to someone else in Tech Support and they would contact me. Its been at least five "business" days. Since you're 24/7, its 7 days for sure. No contact whatsoever. Same thing happened last year, no follow up.The latter especially reflects poorly on TaxCut. And if I use your online Chat help, I might get a good, intelligent helper or I'm just pissing in the wind for 45 minutes with Bozo.Like I said, both apps have flaws and seem to be only ones available for Mac OS - better than having no software at all but very frustrating nonetheless.</review>

<review id="6446">The best about this seventh season of Smallville is the score music by Mark Snow/Louis Febre, who composed some beautiful emotional music for this season, too good for the story and specific scenes of the show.This season is disappointing (almost as bad as Season 4):- there's no consistency in the storyline: in the first half of the season it revolves around Lana and Clark, their relationship, how they could overcome their trust issues. And in the second half of the season Lana is almost completely out of the picture. This is poor writing and leaves Lana/Clark fans (contrary to some comments, there are still some of them out there) frustrated. Regardless of writers strike or whatever, they writers can do a lot better than this.- to end the relationship between Clark and Lana (and her appearance on the show) through some video tape message is just TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE. Come on! They could at least have created one last scene between them to placate fans.- the whole story goes too far: brain interactive construct, time travels to Krypton, some device to control Kal-el, this stupid character of Kara. That's just ridiculous. I think the fortress and the voice of Jor-El, maybe some evil Kryptonians is credible in this context, but that should be enough.- if people complain about the Clark and Lana relationship, well the story about Chloe and Jimmy is far more annoying.---Yes, it is difficult to keep up the level after so many season, but Season 5 and 6 were, in my opinion, great seasons, if not the best ones.Now with only two of the main cast remaining, real Smallville fans might turn their back on the show. Instead, they should have made this 7th season the last one, with all actors still under contract, and come up with a better story to end this.Goodbye Smallville!</review>

<review id="6447">I bought this to listen to three things: cd's that I'd ripped to my computer, Audible downloadable audiobooks and NetLibrary audiobooks.I ended up returning the item after a frustrating experience with their customer service folks who were unable to fix my problems. I could download things sometimes, but the Sansa would index incorrectly. For example, the music will transfer to the sansa but it would not play. Sometimes a chosen song would play, sometimes a chosen song will appear on the screen in pause mode and would not get out of pause mode. When I'd go back to the play menu, all items on the Sansa would list with that song title.I'm quite technically inclined, so this wasn't operator error. Ended up getting the Creative Zen Nano Plus. It is working very very well.</review>

<review id="6448">I was seriously disappointed with this product.

<review id="6449">This is a cheap player and im not talking about price.  The quality of these players has gone down and wasen't very high to start with so beware of what you are buying.  Is it cheeper to buy this and have it die within a day/month or just get an IPOD/Zune that will last you years and has awesome customer support.  I will go with IPOD/Zune.  This player is finally what drove me into getting an IPOD.  I lost my music to many times to poorly designed, low quality players, enough is enough.  All the problems listed here are the same problems I have experienced with this and nearly every sandisk player. It takes forever to copy songs, freezes, battary may charge when you plug it in or it may flake out within seconds after saying it's charged and you unplug it, it says songs are copied when they are not, the play order of songs is retarded, the controls are cheap and unresponcive, and this device is over all just garbage.

<review id="6450">This review is from: Quantum of Solace [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)      This latest installment in the Bond series was on several 'Worst of the year' lists, and rightfully so.  Let me first say that I'm a huge Bond fan.  I see the film in the theatre and then get the DVD.  In some cases, I own both the DVD and the blu-ray of several Bond films.  That being said, this movie was terrible in its attempt to be a "Bond movie".  The reasons are numerous and I won't list them.  If you want to see a pretty good action movie, then you will enjoy "Quantum of Solace" (though not nearly as much as any installment from the Bourne Trilogy).  If you are a die-hard Bond fan seeking a superior follow-up to "Casino Royale", then you can safely skip this one.</review>

<review id="6453">This device's warranty is limited to one year. And mine stopped working properly shortly after one year from the purchase date. I asked a few other people from the university I am going to now who had this zip drive. They had encountered the device failure around a year or a little over a year as well. It was stupid of me for not reading the tech details. This zip drive's lifetime also depends on how many times you insert or remove a cartridge.Unless you are planning on throwing it away shortly after the warranty expires, purchase the internal zip drive. It's much faster and reliable.</review>

<review id="6454">It was my first attempt with iomega, which will be my last. The hard drive constantly looses it's connection to my Mac while I'm working on files. How does a product like this get made?  I'm a designer and an animator, and I'm using files each day off of the portable. I'll be working and all of a sudden, the file is disconnected. It's terribly frustrating to know that each time it happens it brings me closer to loosing important files. The small USB port on the harddrive is not strong enough to even hold the USB cord. I'm out money from the purchase, and my designs are yelling "Don't you dare put me on that portable!"</review>

<review id="6455">I bought the Linksys WUSB54GC wireless USB adapter to connect to my new Linksys WRT160N wireless router.  Although I am a fairly advanced user, I could not get the adapter to stay consistently connected, even though other wireless devices in the house stayed connected flawlessly.  I called Linksys technical support.  They were pretty lousy, and after speaking with 5 different representatives, the product was deemed defective.

I was so excited to read this one, that I almost had to buy it rather than wait to get it from the library.  I was very disappointed, mainly because Edward is missing from almost the entire book.  To me, that was the best part about the first book, the interaction between Bella and Edward, and by extension, his family.  This new story line with Jacob just doesn't do it for me.  Higher hopes for the  third book, "Eclipse" due out soon.</review>

<review id="6463">To say that I didn't enjoy Eclipse is an understatement. In my opinion, Stephenie Meyer came off as an amateur in this book. The previous installments displayed a love so pure and this book throws in a third party that gobbled up way too many pages. It almost seems as if Edward represents the author's husband, someone she is obligated to end up with, while Jacob represents the high-school boyfriend she wishes she'd chosen. It makes no sense for Bella to have a difficult time choosing between Edward and anyone else - not when the author has her ready to turn over mortality and grasping at death at the idea of being with Edward. I found the book to be disjointed, and by the end I hated more of it than I liked. I don't think I could sit through a movie of this book if it ever made it. And I can't imagine why true fans of the story of Bella and Edward would enjoy this book. Bella came off as cruel and Jacob was the most annoying character in print. I spent the entire book hoping he'd get killed. He was so nasty that I was sure he was the mastermind behind all of the horrible things that were happening in the book. In addition to the many things that didn't make sense, was Bella's reluctance to accept a marriage proposal from Edward. I think even Meyer herself knew this was absurd and did her best to give the character an excuse, but it didn't make any sense at all. Especially when, in the previous book, Bella rushed off towards her death to save a then-absent Edward, whom she wasn't even sure still cared about her. I am very disappointed in this book.</review>

<review id="6464">It was to be an exciting moment for me, after adding a second computer at home I needed to set up a network. I had heard great reviews about the Linksys WRT54G and made my purchase. Well my excitement dwindled to discouragement trying to use their software disc which would not allow the router to sync with my computer, so I called customer service. If you enjoy talking to a person with close to zero personality in a foreign country on the other sid eof the planet, than Linksys customer service is a match for you... but not me. After 3.5 hours on the phone, talking with three different technicians, they got my connection in sync and off I went. Unfortunately over the past 11 months I had to repeat this 3-4 hour tech support call for other, out of the blue sync issues with the wwireless router. In addition to the sync problems and lifeless customer service technicians, the two antennae wireless router has some of the weakest signal strength I have seen. I had to purchase an additional reception antennae for the computer 45 ft away from the router in order to get "good" signal strength.Fortunatley for me I got a new 2WIRE 2701HG-B wireless modem/router with no external antennaes at all. I took it out of the box, plugged it in, turned on the computer, and then 5 minutes later after inputting my AT&T info I was connected. Then it took 5 minutes more to set up my 2nd computer to the wireless signal. Linksys will no longer be welcome in my home... It's going on e-Bay this week.Dennis VosperPre-Paid Legal AssociateOceanside, CA 92056760-917-4009</review>

<review id="6465">I was excited to be able to run Office on my Mac without having to boot Windows. If Office applications are valuable to you, BEWARE, these are not the same apps we had on Windows. Outlook is called Entourage and seems to have most of the same features and capabilities, BUT you can't easily transfer your email, contacts, calendars, etc. from Outlook to Entourage. Big problem for me! Also Excel is not fully implemented with visual basic macros so spreadsheets with fancy built-in features won't work. This is also a problem for me.Word seems to work fine but I haven't tried anything fancy there yet.Bottom line: It's not the same Office you are used to if you came from Windows. They should be more clear about the differences.</review>

<review id="6466">Went on opening night to see this with the family. Avoided all commercials and was greatly looking forward to a fun time. I've loved every Pixar film to date afterall. But man I have to say Wall-E was a huge disappointment to me. Occasionally cute and briefly clever in parts, but overall just a boring marathon of nothingness. I was looking at my watch 20 minutes in. Never a good sign. Took way too long to get around to the meat of the plot, and when it did it was just far too busy and schizophrenic to enjoy. I was also irritated at the utter lack of color in the first part of the movie. I know they were depicting a deserted Earth devoid of plant life and full of garbage, but jeez would it have killed them to color up the garbage a bit at least? Especially since there is no dialogue to speak of during this initial period of the film.  If you have no words, then no good visuals, what the heck is left?  Who pays $8 a ticket to watch a CGI simulation of a dust storm for 20 minutes?Now the movie's heart is in the right place and because of that I really WANTED to like it more. It has admirable if overly preachy messages about caring for the planet and what slobs we as a species are becoming. But the story should have been much, much denser for being as simple as it is. Every time a little story momentum would build up, the film would shift gears and go instantly flat again. I am aware of all the reviews that say that this film is great so I know I'm in the minority on this one.To me, the surest sign this movie was a dud was my kid's reaction. She's 7 and loves these CGI movies as much as I do (I'm a big kid myself and go to CGI's even without my kid). We went to Kung Fu Panda twice and were so entertained.  But in Wall-E she was bored to tears in the first 20 minutes. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough good stuff happening in the next 80 minutes to win her back over. She was genuinely glad when it was over. She was as restless as I was during the whole movie.  As much as it pains me to say it, I have to give this Pixar film a below average score of 2/5. There is a good message in the film and its certainly produced well, but the story just takes too long to reveal itself.  And in the absence of great visuals and dialogue for much of the movie, the viewer gets easily frustrated. By the time you see what the plot is about, the movie just can't make up the ground it has lost.</review>

<review id="6468">Seventh Generation offers two types of bath tissue: 500 sheet and 400 sheet.  The one listed above, at 500 sheets, is the thinner, tougher, more abrasive type.  The one to get instead is the following, also available on Amazon (sometimes):Seventh Generation Bathroom Tissue, 2-ply White Unscented, Case Pack (48-400 Sheet Rolls)The 400 sheet variety is not only great for the environment (80% post consumer recycled/ whitened without chlorine bleach) but also soft and comfortable.  Amazon currently lists it as 'unavailable'.  To encourage Amazon to carry the more comfortable one, add that one to your wish list.  Or once it is available, purchase the 400 sheet one instead.The 500 sheet variety will remind you of being in a gas station restroom.  If you end up buying this in bulk, you'll find yourself secretly buying traditional toilet paper to pull out of the cabinet when you have guests...</review>

<review id="6469">I purchased this to do some videos from off the gas tank of my motorcycle. Any video that you take over 10 minutes is going to be 200mb is size of a simple AVI file. The problem came about that many of the 20 minute video's we took could not be taken off the device. We had to go back out and do a complete re-take of everything we did out-of-town. We tried on XP and Vista and 4 different PC's FOR HOURS to get the video's off the device and could only get a few off it. We tried Windows Explorer and the self contained software, to no avail - Goodbye Flip - Enjoy your trip back. JUNK! I love the way it just dangles out a USB port...</review>

<review id="6470">I purchased both a Zune 120 and an Ipod Classic. Except for battery life and more choices to buy on iTunes, the Zune is easily the better mp3 player. As long as you check your settings, the battery life on the Zune is fine anyway. The sreen size is so much better. The navigation on the player is WAY better. It's amazing how iPod reviewers never actually look at the Zune before blindly buying an iPod.</review>

<review id="6471">Brought mine when it just came out so maybe they've tweaked it by now but the light letters on dark keys just dont work well during the day. They're light blue against black and the contrast just wasnt good enough. At night or in a dark room visibility is a lot better.The room where I keep my PC has a lot of natural light during the days, so I've since switched to the Saitek Eclipse keyboard (blue against silver keys) which I can comfortably use night and day. The Saitek doesnt have all the features of the logitech, so if Logitech comes out with a G15 with silver keys I would probably switch back.</review>

<review id="6472">I would like you to know that I am a very unhappy customer!!!!I purchased 2 of these routers in January of this year.  I have had nothing but trouble since the beginning.  I paid our IP to come out and set it up so there would be no problems.  I have spent HOURS and HOURS on the phone and internet with the so called support, which has only prolonged the ownership of this so now I can not get a refund and return this junk.I have returned one of the originals and received a new one that has the same problem. If you don't mind having to unplug and re plug the power 5 to 10 times a day, to get access to the internet, or having it disconnect you when you are in the middle of something, or if your cordless phone rings it disconnects you from the internet (it is not plug into any phone line)then this is the router for you.I have now bought a ZyXel router, from the beginning it has worked perfectly, it was a little more money but would easily have been covered by the time spent on hold at Linksys.</review>

<review id="6474">Purchased on Amazon September 16 2008.  Dead before the end of October.  This drive was not abused in any way -- though it is portable, it sat the whole month and a half of its brief life on my desk plugged into my desktop computer.  The desktop computer is rarely used, so the main activity taking place was updating / running antivirus (Trend Micro) in the background and running Diskeeper defrag utility.  The computer is plugged into a surge protector, and I have surge protection provided by my power company to my entire house.  The drive generates endless loop of messages that it needs to be formatted -- as quickly as you can close them new ones appear, filling up the taskbar.  Occasionally it pauses long enough to ask if I want to run chkdsk.  If I say yes, chkdsk runs for about 20 seconds, then the drive starts clicking and chkdsk runs no further.</review>

<review id="6475">This unit has problems.  I set security to High & I had major problems sending emails or changing between emails.  Called Motorola twice.  Tech's helped, but neither one had much knowledge about this unit.  Wish I could remove whip antenna as I can not put on top of computer.  I disabled wireless, so do not need antenna.  Set up manual limited & no owners manual.  I could not download the CD owners manual.  So I downloaded it from Motorola website.  Price varies on Amazon a lot.  I ordered it after price increased to $117, then dropped again.  SBG900 should be best Cable Modem/Router/Gateway available.  Look for it &lt; $110.  If it screws up, best reboot & wait a day.  Using Astound 6 Mb/1Mb for $30/month for a year.  Tech was here 10/11/08.  He could not troubleshoot slow cable problem.  Obvious he had not taken A+ & N+ courses.  Motorola should provide hard copies of their manuals.</review>

<review id="6476">I have an new fully tricked out Alienware laptop and a Sony pc and tried for many hours to make either computer even see the harddrive. The information inclosed mentioned having to format it for a pc but not for a mac. I tried to do that following the directions and still couldnt make it work. Sure do wish I had known that befor I sent for it.  I love, admire and totally respect people that it comes easily to to do that kind of thing. But for me I want and expect to plug something in and have it work. I am a photographer/videographer.

<review id="6477">I should have tried this out when I bought it as it's too late to send it back to QVC. The camera is good, lightweight but sturdy, easy to use, resolution and sound is good. I spent the last two days taping myself to meet a submission deadline and now I'll miss out on the opportunity due to the unusable software. I'm fairly savvy but there are few edit options, no instruction or video tutorial and definitely no help from arcsoft. When I tried to cut out some dead footage the sound went out of synch. Also, the files are only usable to arcsoft, Windows Movie Maker cannot access them or any other program....so I'm outtaluck on meeting the deadline...all due to this software which, if you look online, has many detractors.</review>

<review id="6478">This is the 2nd D-link Networking Product I've purchased in the last several years and it was a big mistake again.  The D-Link DIR-655 has a networking glitch that caused me major frustration to troubleshoot and finally just plain didn't work (just like the WiFi Webcam I purchased a few years ago).  If you have a printer with built-in Ethernet networking, steer clear of this product.  I plugged my printer's Ethernet cable directly into one of the router LAN ports, configured all settings as I have with 2 previous WiFi Routers (Linksys and SMC), and while the printer appeared on the network (responds to some IP address pings), none of my wired or wireless computers could print due to communications errors.I called D-Link support, and gosh were they horribly clueless.  They forced me to speak to 3 different Level 1 support techs even though I asked for a more senior tech support rep (because they kept asking me to do really dumb things to troubleshoot, and I clearly knew more networking basics than they did).  I then got run through two Level 2 reps, at which point they gave up and told me to call in the next day for a L3 tech.  I call in, ask for a L3 tech, get put on hold for 45+ mins (when they told me it would take 2-3 minutes), and then a rep picks up saying "L2 support".  I explain to the L2 supervisor that I need a L3 rep, and after another 15 min hold, I finally get to a L3 tech who tries to troubleshoot, but is stumped as well and admits that "not many people who use their router have network-capable printers".  Somehow that is supposed to excuse how their product cannot seem to handle simple peer-to-peer 10/100 Ethernet networking?Oh, and by the way, the main reason I got this product was to see if it would have better range and signal strength than my Linksys WRT54GS...and it didn't.  Still only 2 bars in my kitchen less than 50 ft away.  I'm returning it today, and in the future, I'm avoiding D-link products like the plague.</review>

<review id="6479">I bought one of these as a Christmas present for a relative.  When I heard it for a few minutes, I thought I'd like to have one, too.  So I ordered another one for my own use.The one I received was defective -- it would only play one sound.  (Amazon's return and replacement procedure worked smoothly and rapidly.)  The replacement worked as advertised.  However, the product is unsatisfactory.     - The speaker is small, apparently cheaply made, and sounds "tinny".     - After sampling all choices of sounds, the only selection that was of any interest to me was the "gentle rain".  However after listening for an hour or so, I began to discern where the sound "looped".  Once the recurring pattern of sounds became apparent, it couldn't be ignored.  Instead of being relaxing, it had become annoying. Consequently the product is now useless to me.My recommendation is to avoid this product.</review>

<review id="6482">I have limited time to deal with things like small appliances, so I thought I would go right for the gusto and buy what seemed to be the top-of-the line toaster.  Well, this thing is overpriced, oversized, and overweight.  Most importantly, it does not toast well.  I tried several different kinds of breads and settings and ended up with slow, uneven toasting (usually the top half of the bread was burned and the bottom was barely warmed, or the bread had to sit in the chamber so long that it dried out instead of toasted).  I am returning it today and enjoying the Cuisinart CPT-140 I bought instead -- a $50 cheaper, more compact, and even-toasting machine. I have never written a product review before, but I really felt compelled this time.  Don't waste your time or money on this toaster!</review>

<review id="6483">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      I'm not saying that Twilight was perfect, but it was pretty amazing in and of itself.  I remember finishing it and thinking that I'd like a sequel because it was brilliant for a YA novel but I wasn't expecting there to be one, because, as far as I was concerned, the story was complete and at an end.  When I heard about the sequel, I was excited, of course; but now after reading this and now Eclipse, I'm just aggravated at how far gone these past two books are.  Sure there are some interesting quirks in both books, but there's no story left and by using the werewolf card which practically every other vampire romance novel has used (never mind that they're all vampire romances in a completely different sense), Stephanie Meyer's pulled her story uncompromisingly into the cliche.  Besides that, Edward runs off to commit suicide (not something Edward would do; if he truly loved Bella he would live for her or at least bother going to her funeral0; their relationship seems strained and unbelievable beyond the first book; and the contest between Edward and Jacob is ridiculous.  Edward's character is so unbeleivable and cold that I was actually rooting for Jacob, who seemed to genuinely care for Bella.  I know you're asking, "Why is she talking about Eclipse when this is a review for new Moon?" why? Because it's just part of my point.  Twilight can stand on its own, and the very prescence of sequels to it taint the original story, in the same way Hannibal and Hannibal Rising tainted the Silence of the Lambs and red Dragon.  Part of writing a good story is knowing when it's finished, and by continuing this series she's jeopardizing her reputation as a writer.</review>

<review id="6484">I held a high opinion of Netgear in the router arena until I tried this router.  Now, I will avoid this company as much as possible.If you are a simple user who wants secure wireless access in your house, this is a great router for its price.  But anything beyond that it utterly sucks.Although it maintains the LAN and Wireless network, it drops the Cable/DSL/WAN link ALL the time.  The longest I have gone is 3 days and the shortest 5 minutes (avg ~1-2 days).  The absolute worst part is that the router never realizes it.  If I am there, I can manually reconnect instantly everytime, but if not, it will take 6-8 hours before figuring out that it has lost the WAN link and try to reconnect.My 5 year old, then (...), router can stay linked up for weeks and reconnect instantly after a loss.  I can totally depend on it for months on end but alas it is not wireless.Quite a few people seem to have this problem and have complained since the beginning.  This is the 6th version of their firmware and they still haven't solved the problem!!  Although all the "features" of this router work, it fails at its core task.  Says something about the company.My recommendation... if you need anything more than simple web browsing (VPN, online banking, personal servers...) go try your luck at the the other companies or spend a little more and get a better value with the highend routers.Good luck.</review>

<review id="6485">Yikes! This item has TWO cutting implements - which is one too many. The foil covered blade(s) are much too "snippy" (like my daughter's chihuahua)and the built in trimmer on one side of the foil is just plain scary to get anywhere close to where it is intended.

<review id="6486">This review is from: Eclipse Special Edition (The Twilight Saga) (Hardcover)      The first book of the series of Twilight was brilliant, the second one following wasn't far behind. The third book however left a sour distaste in my mouth. The development of a certain relationship of two characters was taken a few steps too far and it seemed more out of desperation to keep the readers reading to get to the happy ending everyone wanted instead of the interesting plot and character development found in the first two books. However hopefully the fourth book can balance out the disappointment found in the third book.</review>

<review id="6488">Got this laptop in December '08, and was dissapointed right out of the box. It appears that the one I got was made for use in the UK, as the power adapter had round European-style prongs. Thankfully the battery came fully charged or I wouldn't have even been able to use it until acquiring a Euro-to-US adapter.I called customer service to ask them to send a US power adapter, and see if licensing was different between the UK and USA. The person I spoke with didn't seem to have any idea what I was talking about with regard to either the plug or the licensing. I had to escalate the call to the next level before someone knew what was going on. I was assured that a new adapter would be mailed out, and that licenses were the same.The laptop itself feels rather flimsy. The plastic case is rather thin, and the screen a bit too flexible to feel safe pulling it open by one corner. Having handled some other light-weight laptops, this one felt poorly made.I installed Windows XP, which was a feat without an internal CD drive; I had to use an external USB CD drive and change BIOS settings to get it to boot. Samsung does have all the drivers for XP available on their site. The response under XP was much better than Vista, which the laptop comes pre-installed with. The SSD drive certainly made a big difference in OS and app load times. The battery life was very good for the size of battery, especially if I didn't use the wi-fi.After a month of owning the X360, I opened it to find the lower-right corner of the screen was cracked just above the hinge. I've been keeping this thing in a well-padded laptop bag, and handling it carefully - especially since it feels so flimsy. The crack caused the right-hand side of the screen to show only colored vertical lines. I called support, and they sent out a shipping tag to send it in for repair. No indication at that point whether or not they would cover it.Before sending it I backed up everything on the machine, and in the little handling that I did the screen cracked even more. Suddenly I was stuck with only the lower-left corner of the screen. Thankfully it has a VGA port or I would never have been able to backup my data before sending it to an uncertain fate.In the end, Samsung has refused to cover the repair. The person in "Executive Customer Relations" was very fixed on not covering ANY damage, regardless of cause. He was nearly monosyllabic in repeating his Not Covered mantra. Not only that, but right after I sent it out I finally got the "replacement" power cord more than a month after I requested it, and it was the same European-style plug that it had come with. A month after that, the US cord finally did arrive. TWO MONTHS LATE!Beware of these laptops. Samsung has sacrificed durability for weight by producing a lightweight laptop that needs to be treated like glass. I would recommend going a pound heavier and getting something more durable.Update: Samsung has had my laptop for 18 business days and has told me twice that the part "just came in, it will ship later today".</review>

<review id="6495">I thought this was the full season until I got home. NOWHERE on the box set does it say "EXPERIENCE THE FIRST HALF OF SEASON 2." OR "STAY TUNED FOR MORE EPISODES." Something useful like that. Noooo. It says "Relive all the intensity and excitement aboard the Galactica with a supernova of explosive bonus features, including deleted scenes and podcasts". I only noticed when I was looking at season 1 dvd set. They call it "Season One". On this set they call it "Season 2.0", so I started getting suspicious why it was 2.0 and not Two, as if they were planning to release a 2.5. After further research I found the season isn't even fully aired yet. I don't follow the Sci-Fi channel because all they play is horror with rare goodies like this show in it.I got Season 1 DVD at Wal-Mart for 19.98 after it was out for a while. Season "2.0" I atleast got on sale for 29.99 w/ the $10 off for buying Serenity. But it's still a rip. WAIT FOR THIS TO GO DOWN, YOU WILL FIND IT FOR 9.99 WITHIN MONTHS I GUARANTEE.In conclusion, the sci-"horror"-fi channel sucks even more now than usual.</review>

<review id="6496">Considering that some people have actually raved about this product, perhaps there is just a difference in the pet's hair that makes it work for some and not for others.I tried it on both of our cats who have been heavily and continuously shedding.

<review id="6502">I'm not saying anything that hasn't already been said.  This coffee maker makes weak coffee.  That is a huge bummer as everything else about this machine is awesome!  Unfortunately, without "strong enough" coffee then the rest doesn't matter in my opinion since that is the whole point of buying a coffee maker.  You buy a coffee maker to have the cup of coffee that makes the most sense to you and if it doesn't live up to that, then it is worthless.That said, let me say that if you like weak to almost medium coffee, then you will absolutely love this coffee maker.  As a bonus, it also makes tea and hot water for hot chocolate.  The water is heated up unbelievably fast(I'd say about a minute from pressing the power button to "ready to brew").  After that, you get a cup of coffee in seconds.  Less than a minute for sure, probably less than 30 seconds.  The LCD screen is extremely easy to read and looks appealing with it's blue glow.  The entire machine is attractive and easy to look at.  The buttons are easy to understand and every type of cup I put under the drip portion, fit fine even with the spill plate underneath.  I really wanted to love this coffee maker, but it falls short in the "perfect" cup of coffee dept.  I tried all of the strong coffee's such as Van Houtte Eclipse Extra Bold Coffee, Timothys Rainforest Espresso Extra Bold Coffee, Green Mountain Dark Magic Extra Bold Coffee, a bunch of others.  None of them are even kind of strong.  I would consider them slightly less than medium.  The weaker coffees are like drinking coffee flavored water and adding any milk or sugar(even minute amounts) destroys any coffee flavor that might have been there to begin with.Now, I only drink one cup of coffee a day, sometimes two.  So I am not this huge coffee drinker and I can even skip a day here and there.  I wouldn't consider myself a coffee snob, but I'm getting there ;)I think the last important thing to mention is that I used to drink a lot of Starbucks and they make strong coffee.  Yes, I know it's bitter as well, but you can't deny the strong coffee they make.  Bottom line:Pros-Coffee maker is easy to use-Tea is an added bonus -Attractive machineCons-very weak coffee (I deducted 3 stars for this alone)-temp only goes up to 192 degrees for the water(I like it hotter)-9.25 ounces is the largest cup you can make</review>

<review id="6504">I have had two Sandisk Cruzer 4GB drives stop working. After the first one died, I was scrupulous about using Windows "stop/ safe eject" process, thinking I had caused the problem. But two giving out within a year can't be the result of  the way I'm handling the drive. Both times, it stopped being recognized by Windows, or I got an error message  saying the drive must be formatted, but it  wouldn't  install so that I could run it or format it. Avoid this one like the plague, and don't store anything on it that isn't backed up.</review>

Hopefully , by July 4th I will have gotten my money back and will at least have my faith restored in Amazon.  The company was called Undercutters and then later called Cannot Remember.

<review id="6507">This router, while exceedingly popular, is very poorly designed, has a much shorter range than most of its competitors and does do very well at sustaining high speed (or low speed) connections for any period of time.

<review id="6511">We had the same Cuisinart DCC-1200 at my work and it lasted about one year before the heating element died.  So much for that.  I just bought this for my mother and it was a TOTAL WASTE of MONEY.  Please LOOK ELSEWHERE as this has some SERIOUS FLAWS.  First, if you like your coffee hot, forget it! Lukewarm is about all this machine can make.  Going back for a second cup?  Not unless you like your coffee ICE COLD!  And that is after just 5 minutes!  If you didn't have a microwave near by to reheat the coffee you would really suffer.  The design is very bad.  The water reservoir is small and hard to see into and very hard to pour water into.  Overall, I wouldn't give this even one star.  I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER CUISINART COFFEEMAKER.  Very very bad.  I should have known better.  All my mother wanted was a decent cup of coffee and you would think that a machine at this price would deliver.  I am disappointed.</review>

<review id="6512">I'm heavily invested in the technology. I have too many Linksys accessories to change branding. I have never... I repeat NEVER had successful experiences with any router working thru either cable or DSL. I'm on my fourth model... they are all pretty much the same... They are iffy, problematic and unreliable, and to expect these devices to provide any level of consistent service, is obviously asking way too much. They stop working daily... often hourly. They tune out and refuse to reconnect without the proverbial reboot, pray, reboot, reset... and pound a few tables routine. How many times do I need to reinstall the software? How many connection checks does it require for my hard earned green cash to produce results that are CONSISTENT? How about REALIBILITY? Do the tech support guru's in India ever consider any options other than reboot, reinstall Windows, call the DSL company and complain?... and it goes on and on. Just to let you know... if I run directly from DSL to computer... it works perfectly and forever and a day. When I connect a router to my simple system... the evil router gods spew fire and wrath down upon my office. So...? Does the rest of the consumer world out there have as many issues as I do? Even if a small percentage of users out there are experiencing this type of frustration?? I wonder why we are continously throwing money at these people? Time for a little more responsible accoutability?</review>

<review id="6515">Had our Petmate for just over a year. I just tonight threw it in the garbage. When we first got it, it took my 2 cats over a month before they would go near it. They seemed to like it okay after that. About a month ago I found it had been leaking a little. I took it apart, cleaned it and it appeared to be okay. I never did figure out why it was leaking or from where. Tonight after being gone all day, I came home to find a big puddle of water on the floor. Again I can't see why it's leaking or where it's coming from. I had it setting next to the microwave stand which now has water damage around the bottom. Leason learned. I guess the cats will just have to get used to the old fashoned bowl of water again.</review>

<review id="6516">My husband only uses this cologne.  I thought I was surprising him by getting him not one but two colognes as a surprise.  The surprise was on me instead!  The scent is not the same and last on his skin less then 5mins.  When he opened the 2nd cologne the same thing happened.  I am really really upset and annoyed that this has happened as I have confirmed what he stated is true. I have wasted my time and money on this purchase.  I will NEVER purchase anything from this buy again.  Since this problem I have read many other comments from other customers that have stated the same. The cologne is certainly a fake!!</review>

<review id="6517">We purchased the wireless pet containment system for our two dogs when we moved into our new home. In our previous home we had the wired system and never had any problems (other than occasionally breaking the wire when planting shrubs).  The wireless system we have found to be very unreliable.  Signal is not consistent, vehicles interfere with signal and the collar transmitters wear out much too quickly.  The company gives us a hard time replacing the collar even though it should be under warranty.  We've replaced two of them already.  We've had the wireless in place for two years now but will be purchasing wired containment system very soon, as the collars again need replacing and this time are out of warranty period.  It is less expensive for us to replace whole system than to keep purchasing collar transmitters.</review>

<review id="6518">I bought this as a gift for my Fiance' for his birthday since he drinks coffee occasionally and I do not.

Now, try taking a cup mid brew and the coffee keeps pouring out and doesn't stop like it's supposed to! It's such a lovely feature don't you think? NOT!

<review id="6519">I have always in the past held Seagate products in high esteem. So when I needed a new hard drive to serve as a scratch disc for Photoshop, I purchased the 500gb FreeAgent USB drive. (The scratch disk if just used for temprary files - I wasn't actually storing any full-time data on the drive.) Within a month, it had completely died. I returned it and exchanged it for a new one. It completely dies within 10 days. First time, maybe a coincidence, but after two in a row have tanked... well, good thing it was only holding temp files, not anything important. Next time around, I'm certainly NOT going with the FreeAgent again!</review>

<review id="6521">Had this router for a while and it's been a constant headache. It randomly drops the internet connection and then reconnects. Not a big deal if you're just checking your email, but if you're trying to upload/download anything, forget it! At first I was led to believe it was due to too many simultaneous connections overloading it (though I never quite believed that) Now I can't do anything with a file over about 2mb even when it's the only thing running and no other devices are connected to the network. Trying to upload files for a website or stream files is useless since it's constantly crapping out. I've ended up skipping the router altogether when I want to get any real work done. Fortunately my modem is in the same room as my computer so I can just plug it straight in. Worst $150 I've ever spent on a computer product.</review>

<review id="6524">Physical quality of the keyboard is fine. But the main keys stop working at random intervals requiring a reboot.

<review id="6526">I purchased the Extreme 3D Pro because it had the best control layout of the sub $40 twist-rudder 3d sticks.  For about 5 weeks it performed as advertised, and then both the x (roll) and z (yaw) axes started to register only 20% of control input in the 'right' direction.  Attempts to recalibrate using Logitechs DXtweak utility restored the input range, but left these axes extremely spiky/twitchy, and hence useless for piloting where it matters (landings, and when he's in your crosshairs). The ergonomics are nice, but from my experience, its poorly engineered, and doesn't withstand normal use.  I've since replaced it with a Saitek Cyborg Evo, which is more comfortable, responds MUCH more smoothly than the Logitech did out of the box, but has awkward throttle and joystick base button placements.  Nonetheless, I wish I got it first.</review>

<review id="6530">I'm a total appliance junkie and boy am I glad I got to try this out before actually buying one. The premise is great - especially being able to microwave the tops and pop them in the dishwasher, which I can't do with my Vita-Mix. I tried egg salad, which turned into a puree with most of the eggs and the celery hanging out on the top, unchopped. Then I tried to give it a chance with some parmesan, which turned into a powder with a large chunk just spinning around the top. I've seen enough - this thing just doesn't work well for much, especially at that price. The Vita-Mix is the best thing I've ever bought and I would HIGHLY recommend investing in one - it's been around for decades, and though it's expensive, it will last forever and replace a ton of appliances. As for smoothies - it even pulverizes the smallest strawberry seeds (and I also make my own flour with it - it's that powerful). Doesn't make sense to waste your money on the Magic Bullet - against the Vita-Mix, it's the difference between a classic and a fad gadget.</review>

<review id="6531">I purchased this brush after looking at the unique brush blade. It was different from my current pet brush, so I decided to try it out.  I thought this is a new technology that can get rid of pet hair better than before.  I am very disappointed after 2 weeks of usage.Pros: It gets hair out of your cats and dogs.  But compared to a 5 dollar brush from Petsmart, it works about the same.Cons: Usually my cat loves being brushed, but he does not like it when I use the furminator. I believe it scratches him too hard.The Furnimator does not contain hairs in the brush. Hair will be left on the pet, so you have to grab all the hair with your hands.  Other brushes collect hairs inside, which makes it easy to clean up.  Furminator DOES NOT collect hair, which makes it HARD to clean up afterwards.If you have a spare 30 dollars and want to try it out, fine, but I prefer my 5 dollar brush from petsmart over the Furminator.</review>

<review id="6532">- I purchased the flip minoHd and the Canon vixia hf100 to compare. After a week, I returned the flip minoHD and kept the Canon hf100.- There were only 2 advantages of flip minoHD over Canon hf100, they both are cosmetic issues.  1) Flip minoHD is light, slim, and small  2) Very easy to use- However, there were many limitations of flip minoHD that really bothered me. These limitations were not with Canon vixia hf100  1) No way to connect the minoHD to HDTV to play the recorded films. People tend to let you connect the camcorder to the HDTV (via hdmi) rather than to their PC/MAC to play the films. They worry more about personal, sensitive files on their PC/MAC to hand the PC/MAC to you  2) Only 1 hour recording space with minoHD. No way to put in additional flash card for more space  3) Limited battery time. No way to swap in the back up battery  4) No full HD (1080p) recording  5) No optical zoom and only 2x digital zoom.  6) No image stabilizationWith the above limitations of minoHD, I felt handcuffed when compared to the Canon vixia hf100. More importantly, I only paid about $300 more to have the Canon (I paid $540 for Canon vixia hf100 + 16GB SDHC + mini hdmi cable)The only negative of Canon vixia hf100 when compare to minoHD was the size and weight. However, its size was the can of soda. I have numerous of cargo pants and shorts so I'm fine with the Canon in my cargo pockets.</review>

<review id="6533">I received the Keurig for Xmas. I used it for about two weeks as my primary coffee machine and now use it as a back up for those days when I'm running late. I don't like the coffee it brews - it tastes too much like instant coffee. I've tried quite a few selections of k cups and even created my own using the reusable filter   Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter(which should cost no more than about $15 and which I do recommend for taste and cost savings).  I think this machine will please occassional or non serious coffee drinkers, but not those who are hard core coffee lovers.  It also might be better for an office machine rather than for home use.The caffine hit from the coffee made in this machine seems a little stronger than from my drip machine.  I didn't read any other reviews mentioning this so it could be my imagination.  Let me know.Pros   Convenient and fast.  Potent caffine hit?Cons   Coffee doesn't taste as good as brewed/dripped.  K cups are expensive.  Noisy.</review>

<review id="6534">I have some negatives about the product.1 - it takes more than one bag of pellets to cover the bottom and these pellets are quite expensive.  Not to mention that the replacement pads are expensive also.2 - the only way I can make the urine pad last a week is to sprinkle some Arm & Hammer pet fresh on it at least once a day. Otherwise the odor is horrible at times.3 - my cat is tracking the pellets out onto the floor.4 - becuase the feces doesn't stick to the pellets my cat is spending more time trying to cover it up and I notice he is breaking up his poop into smaller pieces as he tries to bury it under the pellets.  Problem here is that in order to get the pellets to drop through the scoop I have to use the scoop that came with litter box with the larger slots - and the small poop is falling right back into the litter box.This is turning into much more work than when I used the scoopable Tidy Cat crystals. And I am battling the smell more than with the traditional litter I was using.  This seemed like a great new idea when I read about it and bought it but in reality, it is not working for me.  The cost is a lot more weekly, I am scooping more and attending the litter box much more during the week than I have in the past.</review>

<review id="6536">This review is from: Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa/Nick Penguins 2 Disc Move It, Move It, Double DVD Pack  (Full Screen) (DVD)      This duo was given to my son the other day. After watching the original movie, I was pretty sure I wouldn't like one or two references and scenes, but I gave this one a chance, just so I wouldn't be the mean old parent. What a mistake! This movie, a PG, is not anything you'd want your child to watch. For 10 or 15 minutes, we laughed, but then I no longer could laugh when the blatant sexual references began to pile on. As other reviewers have noted, there's a definite gay agenda that you may not appreciate. The characters make pointed references to each other's bodies and the song lyrics are salacious in the extreme. Beyond that, the writers seem to think that physical violence is hilarious, so the viewer is faced with guns and extended beatings -- and not the momentary cartoon violence of a Three Stooges movie either. Regrettably, the vindictive old woman with the pocketbook figures largely in this sequel, and most of her scenes feature harangues and beatings. Even if we were not offended by this kind of movie, it's not anything you want to watch beyond the first 10 minutes anyway. There's not a laugh to be had after that. And, the love story between two of the main characters takes up so much time that it drags the story down. Even at 10, my son isn't the least bit interested in that line of thinking. Why is our culture so intent on sexualizing our children this early in life?Next time, I'll listen to my inner parent and just say no at the outset. I can take my child's disappointment better than I can take my own disappointment in myself for letting him watch it. It's going to mysteriously disappear soon and end up in the trash.</review>

<review id="6537">The Bodygroom is alright at best.  I bought it mainly because of the flashy advertising (claiming its the bee's knee's when it comes to shaving down under ... it's not), and the good reviews that it got on this site.  I think I'll be the first 'educated' bad review, being that the other bad reviews came from people who generally did not follow the directions, tried to use it to shave their face, etc.  The basics are this: if you're already shaved and you want to use it to maintain, then it 'can' be a useful tool BUT it is not good for the 'tricky' groin areas, which is basically the only reason that I bought the thing.  The advertising claims, or would lead you to believe, that it is designed specifically for those areas when in truth a Bick razor is much less time consuming and much more efficient, and probably ~gasp~ less hazerdous as the Bodygroom will pinch you (note, not cut ... just pinch and scare the bejeezes out of you) if the skin is not held taught.  Additionally, the trimming function of the Bodygroom is virtually useless ... it will take you 5-10 passes with this thing to effectively trim an area, and you have to go SLOOOOOOWWWWWWW with it during those passes.  Although I will say that the ability to push or pull is nice with the trimmer, and that the rounded gaurds for the trimmer are ergonomically nice for some of the harder to reach areas.  Some advise for potential users ... I have found that with either trimming and especially shaving that the thing works best in the shower when you are lathered up with soap (which the manual says you can do)to let the thing slide.  Also a plus is that it doesn't give as much irritation as a manual razor, which is a definately a plus, because I hate getting shaving bumps.  Overall, I would only recommend it if you aren't to hairy downstairs and don't really have to trim any of the tricky areas.</review>

<review id="6538">First, let me be specific, I am reviewing Paperport 11, not Paperport Pro. Why do I think Paperport 11 is a scam? Because it's like a demo version of Paperport Pro (which is the full product). The use of this non-pro version is super limited.Problems:1) I can't create a new scanner profiles (I am limited to the 4 they supplied initially) for scanning.2) They claim to support most scanners, but unless yours is a popular scanner, it's treated just as a generic plain paperport scanner. Nothing special.3) I bought the product hoping it can create searchable PDF files so I can use my desktop search engine (like google desktop) to search my scanned documents. No such thing! To do it, you have to: a) buy Paperport 11 Pro, b) buy OmniPage (I presume). Which totals more than 300 bucks!!!4) Very very limited customer support. You have ONE free technical support call (which I used up during installation because the installer crashed my system). After that, it's 20 bucks per phone call. There is no free email support. The first and every message you send them will cost 10 bucks each. What a scam: crash the user's computer upon installation, force them to call you so they burn up their "free" support. After that, any questions you have will cost you $$$!I so want to return this product, but I already mailed in the UPC code for the rebate so I cannot return the product anymore. Another trap!!! Unbelievable!!!Final words: STAY AWAY!!! I will never buy anything from Nuance, EVER!</review>

<review id="6540">I am a huge fan of the Twilight series.  This book was very disappointing for such a wonderful series.  The story felt disjointed and choppy.  There were several scenes that I felt were out of place.  There were also some holes where I felt she could have elaborated more on the plot and the characters thoughts to draw the reader in.  I felt like Stephenie neglected Edward's and Bella's relationship, the central characters.  She didn't allow it to mature or grow.  In the process, neither did Bella.  The pregnant Bella was one dimensional and it was difficult to feel empathy.  Jacob's imprint felt like a cop out too.  I had to groan and roll my eyes.  We didn't get to enjoy the antics of the other Cullens much either.  I was actually enjoying the characters of Seth and Leah more than anyone else.  I felt like she poured more effort into writing those two.  After reading The Host, I was expecting so much more.  This book didn't read like a Meyer book for me and that disheartens me.</review>

<review id="6541">The name of this products makes certain inferrences- mainly, that thing thing can shuffle songs.  Oops.  It doesn't actually play anything in a RANDOM order.  It just sort of shuffles everything ONCE, then continually loops through that playlist it generated.  This playlist is also extremely poorly shuffled, with songs from the same artist frequently playing one after the other.  How random.Save your money and buy a real mp3 player, not this thing that can't even do what it is named for.</review>

<review id="6542">The characters were not themselves. The story did not match with New Moon and Eclipse. Stephenie Meyer breaks her own rules by Bella somehow getting pregnant. I'm not going to name everything that was horrible about the book because others have already done it.</review>

<review id="6543">The new version 5 hardware has been cheapened in two ways, the DC power brick is cut from 12V at 1000mw to 500mw. The second way is the system memory has been cut from 4MB of flash to 2MB.  The new V5 system also runs on VxWorks instead of Linux.  If you do any hobby development at all, you cannot use this unit, period!  Even trying to load the old Linksys code that (4.20.x) will not work because of the 2MB limit.To those that don't do hobby development, make sure all the features you want are already there, as there is little room left to add anything.I for one, will have to look for another solution.  Bad move Linksys.</review>

<review id="6547">I've had my system for 2 years. The first year it worked great. I did find that the range fluctuated slightly from area to area but the dogs avoided going near the boundaries. After the first year, the collar stopped beeping but still administered a shock so it still worked. I bought a 2nd collar for $120 new. It worked for a year and then stopped beeping. Eventually the collar also stopped shocking. These collars have a lifetime warranty but after the first year you must pay $45 labor charge to have them fixed. I am now contemplating getting rid of the system and just putting up a fence. It may be cheaper in the long run.</review>

<review id="6548">Edward/Bella/Jacob "love" triangle? Whatever... We finally got the backstories for Jasper and Rosalie! And we had wolfpeople (a wolfwoman too, that's right) and vampires working together! This is the stuff of good, cheesy Halloween movies. A good book? Eh. It was kind of more of the same, which, for me, made it pretty forgettable. I only finished it less than 2 weeks ago, and I already have a hard time remembering what exactly happened in the book. Can't even remember it well enough to do my girl/boy/friend stuff from my New Moon review. Oh well... At least it's time for it all to come to an exciting conclusion in the final book... Right?</review>

<review id="6549">At first I thought this litter box was great, but then I realized it wasn't all that great when I had to take it apart and clean the whole thing. My cat sprays on the inside of the box and the rolling action of the self cleaning feature created a coat of clumping litter on the inside of the box as well as odor. So while I thought I was getting off easy with the cleaning- I actually was creating a HUGE cleaning headache for myself...the grill inside was a nightmare to clean! (Even if your cat does not spray remember not to roll the box until after the clumping litter has hardened otherwise you will get sticky litter stuck to the grill.) I went back to a regular litterbox,litter made from wheat and daily litterbox patrol. I'd say I don't do anymore work now than I did when I used this self cleaning litter box. When looking at reviews for this product make sure it is from someone who has used it for at least a month- because I know the first few weeks you'll think you found a gold mine and then you realize cleaning a litterbox still requires work!</review>

<review id="6551">I purchased three Ultras, one for me, two for Christmas presents. In my opinion, I would wait to buy this until Pure Digital gets their act together and has software that is compatible with all operating systems and that actually works. Their QA department failed miserably releasing this too soon with such a lousy software interface. I am having all the same issues other reviewers have mentioned. I can't download videos to my computer; software freezes and have to end task; Flip Video still shows "Connected" after disconnecting from computer and have to take out batteries to get it to restart (a real pain in the you know what) and I have the same issue others stated about starting and stopping recording. It often takes many presses to do either. I tried one of the other Flip Videos I bought and it was worse than the first one. It wouldn't even install the software. I received an error message shortly after connecting it to my computer. This is just too frustrating and I don't have the time (or patience at this point) and I don't want to send my sons' their Christmas present knowing that it won't work. I did write to Pure Digital and got a response back to send it back to them and they will repair it and retrieve my videos and send back. What a bunch of baloney! I just bought the dang thing plus two more for Christmas presents. Why would I want to take the time and effort to send it back to them and then probably have the exact same issue once again, as many of you have noted who have tried this already. Nope, for me, all three Flip Videos are being returned! I'll wait until Pure Digital gets their act together and has a software interface that has been thoroughly tested and actually works! The concept is great, ease of use is very  nice; it's a neat little camcorder. I would have really enjoyed using it if the software worked correctly.</review>

<review id="6552">This is a very nice looking, compact drive with a large storage capacity. I now look at it as a mega USB drive.However, my original reason for wanting one was as a single-PC backup storage for critical files and it just doesn't have the stability for that.The device features a single mini-USB to USB connection (cable included) to provide data transfer and power to the drive. This unfortunately means that the drive can come into scenarios where there isn't enough power coming to it that it can be detected by your PC. This is especially the case if you try to plug it into a USB hub.Plugging mine directly into the PC fixed the problem for me but required me to put my device in an inconvenient location.I like the form factor on this guy and I think the synchronization software would be handy for other people, but I should have purchased a Western Digital My Book Essential Edition 1 TB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive WDH1U10000N instead since it provides power and data connections.</review>

<review id="6553">I've used TurboTax for almost 10 years now and have loved it each year.  But this year is different, the software takes a very long time to install and uninstall and so far after 6 attempts it freezes at 87%.  It has now taken longer to load the software than to do my taxes by hand.  So far their online support has no answers or solutions for me, other than to download the latest version, which I've done 6 times!!  I've spent upwards of 45 minutes on hold with no one answering.  I'm very tempted to try TaxCut.  My next step will be a full refund.</review>

<review id="6554">Note that the one star reflects the Blu-Ray DVD and not the movie. Alot of the film was shot in IMAX. The IMAX scenes ARE NOT widescreen, they ARE PAN and SCAN. I compared the widescreen downloaded version to my Blu-Ray and the downloaded version shows alot that when they Pan and Scaned the IMAX footage they cut some of the picture out. I am debating on sending mine back and buying the regular version so I can ge true widescreen. This is not widescreen.</review>

<review id="6555">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      Despite all the visuals and eye candy, this was actually a disappointing movie for those of us who have been waiting over 20 years for it. There is far too much time spent building up to actual appearances of the Transformers characters. It seems like the focus of the movie is on the humans' perspective, instead of the Transformers' themselves. For me, the TMNT movie was much better than this one was. I mean in the TMNT movie, the focus of the movie wasn't people on the street observing the activites involving the turtles, it was on the turtles themselves! It was great having Peter Cullen return as Optimus Prime, but that wasn't enough to make up for the hour and a half that had to be waited to see any real action. Go buy the 20th anniversary edition of Transformers:The Movie(1986) instead.</review>

<review id="6556">This review is from: Gone with the Wind (DVD)      Okay, why the heck bother write a bad review of this movie? If you think this is a great classic work, you'll likely think I'm a moron that couldn't understand it. Oh well, so be it. I just happened to watch the movie recently, and I just couldn't stand it.Early in the movie, Rhett says to Scarlett, in effect, "you and me, baby, we're a pair of lousy people, you're made for me babe!" So why on earth does anybody care to watch nearly four hours of a couple of lousy people doing really lousy things? I seriously don't get it at all!But Rhett is too hard on himself, he ain't nearly the equal of Scarlett. Four hours of listening to Scarlett whine and cry at the drop of a hat - Christ I needed some earplugs!I'll have to say, the second hour, involving the burning of Atlanta was the best of the movie. In the first hour, we see Scarlett as a spoiled rich brat entirely unprepared for war. In the second hour, we see her, eventually, pull together some amount of strength. She's kicking and screaming every moment, but she does, finally help deliver the child. And we see Scarlett, just before the intermission, give her famous, "with God as my witness, I'll never grow hungry again." So, I'm thinking, hey, I guess Scarlett is going to stop whinning and bawling every damn second. And I figured Scarlett was going to be transformed into a likable character with her war experience to be her impetis to transformation.But NOOOoooo, that's not it at all! What we see is Scarlett continue to whine and cry at every instant, only it is now more calculated. Just designed to get try to get her every whim. The entire second half was just unwatchable. Frankly, I don't give a damn about this most lousy, overrated piece of garbage of all time.</review>

<review id="6558">This product is totally unsatisfactory as a health monitoring aid.  The results are erratic and not reproducible.  It gives WIDELY different readings on left and right wrists (Yes, I changed the calibration as directed.).  It does not agree even "in the ballpark" with an automatic arm cuff model OR a manual cuff/stethoscope.  The much-vaunted APS system is a joke, inflating and registering only at crotch-level when on the right wrist!?!  Steer clear of this product; mine was returned after a very frustrating afternoon of trying to get it to do ANYTHING in a repeatable fashion.</review>

<review id="6559">I had this unit for about six months.  The set up was quite complicated but after several days of email to Linksys, some of which included incorrect steps for setting up the router, I managed to get it set up.  It worked great for six months and then stopped working entirely.   After two days of trying to deal with their tech support, they determined the router was defective.  They however refused to replace it or make good on the warranty -- which is a 1 year warranty.   I tried to get beyond the person I was talking with at their customer service line and she actually refused to connect me with anyone else.   I would never buy a Linksys product again after the way they treated me.  Be warned.  They do not value customers at all.  If you have any problems with a Linksys product, don't expect to have any recourse.</review>

<review id="6560">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      Yes, it was a great cartoon...and now a terrible action movie. This movie sucks.

<review id="6561">I've used this item for 3 weeks now - programming it was straight forward and time consuming but never held the positions.The integration constantly dropped out forcing you to recalibrate every game and often again right in the middle of play.At first I thought it was cool to not have to use the keyboard for stuff, but as it was so tempermental - I went back to the keyboard...what a waste of $100!</review>

You may also need to enter an amount on Form 1040, line 21".That's the same as filling out my federal tax forms by hand!I've never had to go through these gyrations with Turbotax.Granted, all tax software is overpriced but, with this TaxCut product, all you're paying for is aggravation.If your tax situation is very simple, you don't need any software. If your situation is a little more complex, TaxCut will let you down. Either way, TAXCUT IS A WASTE OF TIME & MONEY.</review>

<review id="6563">I've been using Microsoft Office for more than ten years and was asked to "test drive" Office 2007 at my job.  One of the many things I liked about prior incarnations of Office was the ability to install the latest version and be up and running -- I could learn the new features as I went along.  Microsoft took a radical departure and obliterated anything that looked familiar about an interface that millions of users have come to know.  If there were a good reason for the new interface, fine, but there isn't. Microsoft obviously did little to no market research or focus-group studies to determine whether the new look was a good thing.  I don't know whether Microsoft felt it was competing with InDesign or Quark or Apple in attempting a more graphic interface and "improved" functionality, but it is obvious they do not understand their most important resource:  their customers.  I will use Office 2003 as long as possible (as will many companies), and do my best to convince others to do the same.  As I wrote in my title, it really does seem as if Office 2007 was the brainchild of a clown and a nihilist.If you're looking to buy Office, buy Office 2003 instead.If I could give this product less than one star, I would.</review>

<review id="6564">I hate this product. Since I'm used to Office 2003 (at work), opening this program and having to look at the childish-looking menu bar was a shock.

The one-star rating was too generous.</review>

<review id="6566">Even though people are pretty upset with Meyer taking the easy way out I thought it was okay. I mean my reaction after reading Breaking Dawn through the first time was "This was the way she wanted it to end?!?" From the beginning Stephenie Meyer said that she knew the ending to her story because originally Twilight was a novel. All my friends kept saying, "This is not Twilight." I think that her only downfall was Stephenie Meyer wanting a happy ending for all the characters she loved. Even if she went a little too far with the unrealistic ending I can honestly say I'm happy for Bella and what she turned out with. After everything she's been through she deserves happiness, even if it is unrealistic. The part that ruined the book most for me was book 2: Jacob.    Is it just me or does everything with Jacob Black make me depressed? Personally, I think that if that middle section was from Bella's point of view it would have made a HUGE difference as to how we feel about the book. If instead of seeing Bella being stubborn and killing the ones she loves (jacob and edward) from Jacob's perspective, we saw her struggle with sacrificing her own life to save her baby's. What if it was killing Bella to put Edward through more pain, what if she really did want to go to college and stay human for a while longer, what if she knew she was going to die and not be able to stay with Edward forever (even though she tried to convince herself that she would be turned into a vampire before she actually died)? If that was included in the book instead of Jacob's section I really think that it would have been a better book. Jacob's imprinting on their daughter is ridiculous, but if that section was from Bella's point of view Jacob Black would be out of the picture and Bella would have some consequence to becoming a vampire. Everything after Bella becoming a vampire would have fit right into place and it would have been a great ending to this saga.</review>

<review id="6569">I've had 3 major problems since upgrading from Quicken 2007 to 2009.  First, on exiting from Quicken it would appear to exit, but the process would actually continue running and growing in size rapidly until it ran out of memory and crashed.  This wasn't obvious but caused a number of symptoms, such as not being able to reenter after just exiting.  The solution was that my "temp" directory (found by typing "%temp%" in the Run box on Vista) was packed and after cleaning it this stopped.  Quicken support suggested this on the second try.I also have the "tries to launch Outlook" problem. It doesn't seem to matter if you don't have Outlook as your default mail client.  The only solution to this seems to be to uninstall Outlook or have it fully configured to work.  Apparently if you have Outlook installed it must be configured to run, otherwise things don't quite work.  This is a remarkably bad software design decision.Finally, Billminder always crashes.  I've tried everything that Quicken support suggests and it still doesn't work.Some of the new UI changes are nice, but I find the overall design a bit more confusing than earlier versions.  And all of the bugs make this a major disappointment.</review>

<review id="6570">Zojirushi EC-BD15 Fresh Brew Thermal Carafe Coffee MakerI am a fairly serious coffee drinker who roasts my own coffee.  I currently have a Braun Flavorselect drip coffee maker with a glass carafe and wanted a drip maker with a thermal carafe.  After reading the reviews on the Fresh Brew, I purchased it mainly because it was supposed to brew at the ideal 200F temperature. I brewed two pure water runs to clean out the unit and had no problems with leakage.  I checked the water running through the basket with a digital thermometer and it read 180F which was discouraging.  I then brewed 6 cups of Brazil Coromandel-Fazena Sao Joao.  The taste lacked the complexity I got with the Braun and lacked body.  The brew water was about 170F.  I will be looking for a new home for this coffee maker.</review>

<review id="6571">Having never seen one of these up close, I found the picture of the unit confusing. The black you see is a pliable rubber shroud that completely encloses the drive except for the gray area you see. This makes the unit very water resistant. You have to bend and peel off the rubber in order to remove the drive from its case. The drive itself is minuscule, less than two inches long, and has no hole that would allow you to attach a lanyard.To me, the drive is way too tiny and susceptible to loss. It does have a blue LED and copied 300 MB of files in about two minutes.I would have returned it in a heartbeat except for the reason I sought it out. Unlike most drives, it has a tiny read-only write protect dip switch on the side that shields the contents of the drive from malware infection. This feature is not mentioned in the amazon description but does appear on the manufacturer's web site. Access to the switch is recessed and very small. You cannot flip the switch with your fingernail, you must use something like the metal tip of a mechanical pencil to move it. Most users will probably not even notice the switch is there. The Kanguru FlashBlu 2 is another example of a flash drive with a write-protect switch, but it is a bit more expensive.</review>

<review id="6572">This review is from: Gone with the Wind (Two-Disc Edition) (DVD)      While most will argue with me, I must begin by saying that I was not impressed with the overall final results of this "epic".  The hype surrounding it, the overuse of Rhett's infamous line in pop culture, and the fact that most people rave about this being one of the most romantic films ever produced set my standards extremely high.  I wanted to be blown away by the scenes, I wanted characters that would invite me into their worlds and never make me leave, I wanted tragedy on a grand scale, but alas, that wasn't what I witnessed with Gone with the Wind.  Somehow I ending this film with a sense of astonishment, a sense of being robbed, and not at all the romantic film I thought I would be enjoying.  Instead I saw hatred, sexism, racism, alcoholism, anti-love, pro-Confederacy, and ignorance all rolled up together into a two-disc packaging, which would be later called Gone with the Wind.  It was embarrassing to watch and call as one of our "greatest love stories ever".  While it may show us what society was like during a pre-Civil War era, that doesn't mean we have to condone it and embrace it.I realize that the point of this film was to show us a different side of the war.  That all Southerners were not fueled by hatred and surrounded by a violent slavery system.  Instead, there was quite a bit of beauty to the old South.  A sense of pride, a sense of gentlemanly nature, and a sense of honor, which was difficult to witness being trampled on as the North continued its destructive war path.  In that sense, I think it gave us a glimpse of what we lost with the Civil War.  That image of the South was beautifully captured in this film.  This film gives us some of the most beautiful sights of lavish plantations, beautiful greens, and civilized parties.  The technical aspects of this film are astonishing.  While I will agree with most that a widescreen version of this film may have swayed me to giving it one more star, the full screen still demonstrated the amazing sights of the South.  The wide shots of the mansions, the bustling Atlanta area, and terror/tragedy of war was beautifully captured in this film.  For that, I cannot fault this film, but what I can fault it for are the stereotypes, the shallow characters, and the faded ending that just didn't seem to match the overall tone of the film.To begin, the stereotypes.  While most will say that the stereotypes in this film accurately depict the voice of the South, I just didn't feel comfortable watching it in today's society.  I realize that this was made back in 1938, but I still didn't feel comfortable with slavery, sexism, and ignorance surrounding these characters.  Does that make this film dated?  Perhaps if I witnessed our characters going through some form of change I would have softened a bit, but I did not see that at all.  With the continual struggles that minorities have in cinema today, is it wise to continue to think of this film as a masterpiece of cinema?  Is it worth of all the accolades that it received?   No.  In fact, I am surprised that this film hasn't been shunned by a majority of communities during each release.  This is a pinnacle example of what obstacles African Americans are trying to overcome in today's Hollywood.  There are those that speak so highly of Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh's chemistry, but for me, it was non-existent.  I did not see why there are those that fall over this film and praise the story.  I thought that Leigh was horrid as the early Southerner turned feminist.  Gable was so inconsistent with his character that I didn't know whether to love him or hate him.  There was no chemistry or connection between Leigh and Gable.  They were together because the director (which this film eventually went through three of them) knew that audiences would want to see them either together or going to get together by the end.  The rest of it was just trivial.  With the fuzzy direction of Leigh's character, you never quite felt that Scarlett had an ounce of passion in her heart.  She wanted what she couldn't have, like a spoiled child, and that was reflected again with the inconsistent ending.  Gable's character of Rhett was underdeveloped.  We knew nothing about this man except that he randomly continued to jump in and out of Scarlett's life.  Where did his wealth come from?  What was his past?  Who knows ... and none of it was fully explained.  This can be said the same with Ashley.  Who was this guy?  Why did Scarlett choose him over the other possible suitors?  Was it simply because she couldn't have him, or because of some darker reason?  Did anyone else notice that she was Irish, not quite the Southern belle that we had originally hoped for?  Overall, these characters hurt and built upon the ultimate downfall of this film.  They were forgettable from the first time that we met them until the very end of the film.  Underdeveloped, unintelligent, and downright dull.  All elements that gave us too long of a film centered on nothing.Overall, I just didn't see what all the hype was surrounding this film.   Our society has moved forward from this period, but do we need to be reminded of it continually by giving this film more and more accolades?  I don't think so.  I do not wish to see this film again and hope that it does not continue to be a staple of our cinematic society.  From the unexciting, unloving characters (of which we all hate, yet are supposed to love by the end) to smile on Scarlett's face after the marital rape scene, this movie was a disaster.  Grade: ** out of *****</review>

<review id="6575">This is a nice looking compact device, but that's where the benefits end.  I had this thing for about two months and it worked flawlessly until it died.

Not only was the wireless portion dead but the wired connections were dead as well.

<review id="6578">I, like so many others, could hardly wait for Breaking Dawn to come out. I pre-ordered one on Amazon, but I ended up buying one from the store on August 2nd, because I simply couldn't wait any longer. About six or seven chapters in, I was already beginning to feel the sting of disappointment. It just wasn't at ALL what I had expected. The writing felt rushed, and some of the characters' personalities even changed. I did NOT like the "unexpected surprise" that comes about in chapter seven at ALL!! Bella and the other Cullens disappear for a third of the book; it is written in Jacob's perspective instead. There is barley anything about the Cullens, which I found very disappointing; the books are supposed to be about Bella and Edward, NOT Jacob.The third portion of the book is just altogether appalling. Stephenie goes back on a lot of her previous statements, and creates a mini monster and a weird, sick, love square with it. I would definitely not recommend buying this book. Borrow it from a friend or the library if you really want to read it, but it's not worth your money.</review>

<review id="6579">It claims to be compatible with a Macintosh.  HOWEVER the enclosed software states that it does NOT work with a Mac.  When I called Panasonic support, I was told it IS compatible with a mac, but, by the way, they said, only for still photos.  In fact, when I tried to transfer movies from the hard drive on the camera to my mac, my Nikon picture project software opened automatically and brought the movies across as still photos.  The very same support person at Panasonic who told me it WAS compatible with the mac at the beginning of the phonecall, then said that I should have read not just the Amazon website, but also the Panasonic website, where it says that while it is compatible with a Mac, that is only for still photos.  In other words, you take videos with the camera, but when you transfer them to the Mac they come over as still pictures [the first instant of the video] [my Nikon picture project software opened up when I plugged in the camera and brought them in as Jpg files--- I could not change the suffix to mov] Panasonic "support" then said that there was software I could buy that would make this work with the Mac but that she could not recommend other software.  When I said I wanted not a recommendation but some kind of hint, she could not tell me what that software was.  Upon being pressed to give me the name of the software that she said I could purchase that would make this work with a Mac, she checked around and no one else there could tell me the name either.  ALSO, she said that since some people view videos taken by this camera on various models of TV, Panasonic can't support all the other equipment that everyone wants to use to view their movies--- in other words, she dismissed Macs [and also incompatible versions of PC] as yet another vendor that Panasonic can't be bothered to support.I did call Mac.  They tried to get the camera to work with ilife but in fact when I opened ilife and plugged in the camera and turned the camera on, the ilife software said that no camera was attached.I dragged the files from the HD of the camera onto the mac and tried quicktime, but quicktime said it was not a movie file.  I also tried to open files from the panasonic HD from the ilife menu but they all were grayed out.IN SHORT: DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA IF YOU HAVE A MAC.  If you have a PC, check the fine print at the Panasonic website to find out whether your version of PC software works.My feeling, after dealing with panasonic support [they would neither take it back nor help me nor even accept my helpful suggestion that their product information, rather than claiming compatibility with Macs, very prominently feature lack of compatibility]: do not buy this camera or anything else from Panasonic.</review>

<review id="6580">This thing takes about 10 mins+ to copy a 100meg folder of 200kb files! When you first open up the drive it takes a long time to load the directory structure. The manufacturer claims that this drive can write at 3.5mb/sec (very slow for USB 2.0) -- it might peak at that speed for moving large files (like a movie) but the performance drops a lot for smaller files (like photos).If you are planning on getting one of these, it is a tiny little archive that you can stuff into your change pouch or wallet. I use it to store little Excel and Powerpoint files or some PDFs. I would not use this to share photo albums or home videos, it's much too slow for that.</review>

<review id="6585">Bought the 750GB version (basically identical), and it lasted almost exactly 24 hours before dying, taking 300GB of my data with it.  Warranty choices were:1.  Open enclosure to get data out (including credit card and passwords), but loose all warranty.  Often the enclosure dies while hard drive is ok... but it is a risk.  If the hard drive is a problem, doing this creates a beautiful looking, expensive paperweight.2.  Lose data, but get replacement drive.  Bye bye to data, and who knows if they wipe drive properly before recycling it.3.  Pay professional company to retrieve data.  Called one, who wanted $500 minimum.Best choice?  By something that works, and has good support.  WD makes poor enclosures (have now lost 2 this week), and offers poor support policies. Buyer beware.</review>

<review id="6586">We bought this and a couple other patterns... The first time my daughter had a leaky diaper, the color on the sheets ran and ruined her outfit.

<review id="6588">The BabiesRUs store I went to did not have one out of the box to look at, so I went off of what I could tell on the box.  Once I got it home, a few things became obvious.  First, it would not work with my stairs due to the lack of a stud in the proper place on the wall side.  I realize that is not a design flaw in the product and just an incompatibility.  However, I also found it to be a poor design.  When the gate was open, the two pieces would freely slide in and out from each other.  Due to the space between the two pieces, it presented an obvious pinching hazard to little fingers and adult fingers alike.</review>

<review id="6590">I really wanted this to work for our chow/ aikita mix;  we were not interested in any of the other collars that involved electric shocks.  After visiting a Pet Smart and seeing this exact product for over $100, we instead purchased it for $40 on Amazon with the hopes of preventing our dog from waking up the neighborhood early each morning.  But because her coat is so thick and furry, the spray would just shoot into her fur and not beyond to reach her snout.  We tried positioning it many ways and decided that it would probably be necessary to cut some of her hair back for it to even possibily work.  She continued to bark with the collar on, and did not seem effected by the spray.  When she finished her barking session, she licked her lips and the air for awhile and then barked again when she heard a noise at the door.  We took the collar off the same day it arrived.  I really, really wanted it to work.  Unfortunately, it seems as if a spray bottle with water works better for us.  Maybe the collar will some day be refined for thicker coated dogs and different models will be available.  Good luck.</review>

<review id="6591">This product was great for about the first week.  I got it to make sure he was not going to be gorging himself on food while we went on vacation for 5 days and used it thereafter for the convenience--not having to hand feed him measured portions twice a day.  After a little bit, my cat figured out how to reach up into the chute and grab food out, though! I thought he was just getting a few stray pieces out, but when he started gaining MORE weight, I realized that the amount of food he could get out of the chute was only limited by the amount of food you place in the container!  There is no mechanism to keep the food completely out of kitty's reach between meals. This is probably one of the most expensive gadgets I've ever wasted my money on.  If they'd just address this with a part that completely closes off access to the food, they'd have a decent product.  I did have a little trouble with the programming (I'm usually pretty good at figuring out complicated electronics), but got it figured out.</review>

<review id="6592">Within the first month I noticed that the router was intermittently dropping both wired and wireless connections.  During these connection drops the router could not be accessed at all.  "Ping" commands to the router's IP address were timing out.  This indicates a failure either with the firmware or hardware.I submitted an online support request to Netgear, waited a week, and received no response.  I submitted another support request, and again was ignored.  The third time, I sent a message saying their support was useless, and they deleted my online registration.I can forgive problems with a product, but with such a lack of respect for customers, I think Netgear is a company to avoid.</review>

<review id="6593">I tried using this product for a few weeks and could never quite get used to it.  If you're looking for a good quality first-time iron, it does the job.  But if you're used to using irons all the time and like me, want to have control over the temperature, I recommend the Remington T-Studio collection.  It's a fraction of the cost (approx. $38) at your local Target, and temperature settings go up to 200 degrees, at your control.  I prefer that and to save money vs. this product.</review>

<review id="6597">Although I didn't expect much for 59.99 (purchased at London Drugs in Canada), I was surprised at this shaver's fragility.  After taking it out of the box and reading the instructions, I attached a trimming comb to see how it worked.  A moment later, I was struggling to carefully remove the comb from the shaver.  It wouldn't come off.  I was quite worried about breaking the comb since there's no place to apply enough pressure to release it from the shaver (it seemed to me).  Again, I was being as careful as I could and had just about given up when...Suddenly, the head of the shaver came off with the comb still attached.  Aargh...but no big deal, right?  Wrong!  The shaver head attaches to the shaver body via small plastic pieces that were now broken.  I was amazed this could happen so easily.  I've owned many Braun facial hair shavers and nothing like that has occurred with those.  I'm sure this is a fine product for most people, but I'm moving on to something that's better built and that I will be able to rely upon for at least two to three years.  The search continues...</review>

<review id="6598">Got this player for my birthday last year but never used it till Nov. 2007.  Six months later, serious problems.  One day, nothing would sync to it.  I had to go through all sorts of confusing computer stuff to get an automatic update thing.  Now I can sync music, but my previous files are frozen there.  I can play them, but I can't delete them, and they do not come up on my computer.  I can't put playlists on like I used to (by dragging my WMP playlists into the sync window).  WMP says the files were synced, but there is no playlist there. The first time I had problems, I researched a lot on-line, and this is a very common problem (not being able to clear out your music and the playlist confusion).  The only recommendation I found was to buy a new one.  I'm going to spend a little more this time and get something with quality.  If you don't need to erase songs or don't use playlists, it should be fine for you!</review>

<review id="6599">We were upgrading from the Slingbox Classic, so that we could remote to our main HD TV with TiVo. During set-up we could not get a video signal with the new Solo unit and called Slingbox tech support. Let me just cut to the chase: we were told the Solo is not able to receive the signal if your TV and DVR are connected via an HDMI cable (isn't almost everyone's?) unless you disconnect the HDMI connection. Sorry, but I find that to be just a bit too much to ask; are we to disconnect the HDMI before we leave the house every time? It seems to me this little incredible fact should be prominently available; we did the research and had even called Sligbox with compatibility questions before our purchase and no one said a thing.So, we waited for our delivery, installed the unit, spent wasted time with Tech Support only to be told - if you want to use your new upgrade, unplug your HDMI from your brand new, state of the art 52" LCD every time you leave your home. I don't thinks so.... back it goes.We are so disappointed!</review>

<review id="6600">I like Pixar. I think they consistently make good movies -- good in terms of narration, character building, and animation. The Incredibles is one of my favorite movies, and I thoroughly enjoyed Finding Nemo and Toy Story 2. I wanted to like Wall-E and I waited to be blown away.Now even I think that the Pixar hype has gone to a silly level. With Wall-E, I can see that the hype appears to be going to Pixar's head -- which any creative mind can tell you is a death warrant. It's not a death knell for Pixar's profits, not yet; but in trying to keep up with the hype, Pixar must be finding it more and more difficult to keep pumping out the same quality material -- overthinking its creative endeavors, as it were. I feel that this happened with Wall-E: it simply became overwrought.What are the critics gabbing about? This movie is NOT the best movie of 2008. It's not the best of anything, with the exception of its animation -- which does not, can not, make a movie succeed all on its own. In fact, what this movie ultimately reminded me of was a Pixar television special that was about 68 minutes too long.The basic plot is that humankind has "made too much trash" (killed the Earth with their blasted industry and consumerism, those cads) and has blasted off into space to hang out on a spaceship, teeing off and drinking slushies. Meanwhile, down on Earth, little Wall-E units work hard every day to clean up the trash. Let's zoom through 700 years to the present day. That's when we meet our intrepid hero, an adorable Wall-E robot -- arguably, the last of his kind. Apparently, he's been working for centuries (one of several "um, what?" moments), fixing himself with spare parts. Over the centuries, he has developed individuality and a personality; he is friends with an adorable cockroach and collects interesting junk in a trailer. He happens to meet a probe called "Eve" who has been sent to Earth by the star-bound humans for a secret purpose. He falls in love with her. They have an adventure. Will Eve return his affection by the end?!So is there more than that? Well, uh, technically... no. It's a love story between two robots and yet another preachy narrative about how humans suck at taking care of the environment. Oh, Wall-E is cute and instantly lovable, absolutely. The intermittent slapstick is laugh out loud, and the animation glitters. The problem is that it's an incredibly basic story with incredibly basic characters and yet another obnoxious "save the environment!" theme. I was bored out of my mind most of the time.What Wall-E really reminds me of is Studio Ghibli films, which I suppose shouldn't be a surprise, thanks to Mr. Lasater's closeness with Hayao Miyazaki. There's a quiet, understated, delicious kind of joy, optimism, and simplicity about Ghibli films -- most characters are inherently good and cheerful, and everyday life is infused with magic. Wall-E attempts to capture this same pleasant spirit and fails miserably, veering into hateful saccharine territory instead.The problem is that the characters in Wall-E have been dumbed down. Whereas Ghibli's characters generally tend to be complex and flawed -- heck, just as the characters of The Incredibles and Finding Nemo were complex and flawed -- Wall-E's characters seem just... stupid. Obnoxiously stupid, obnoxiously one-sided, optimistic only because they are incapable of feeling anything else. When human beings of the future see Wall-E -- this filthy, antiquated little machine -- they show no surprise at him and ask no questions about his appearance or why he's there. Wall-E simply bumbles from one mishap to another, unwittingly teaching little "life lessons" (ugh) to random people and robots, none of whom seem capable of thinking on their own. It's like a series of bubbly Pixar shorts, plot be darned. Heck, there is only one "villain" to surmount -- and it's not a particularly impressive one!Add to this some heinous dialogue ("Get ready to have some kids!") and some very blah character designs for the humans (all of the fatties look alike, even those of different races... whatever happened to the fantastic character designs in previous Pixar films?), and you have a very shiny, very bland movie.Am I really supposed to believe that human beings don't ask questions in the future and that they lose all of their intelligence? That consumerism blinds them all and that they all turn into miniature Jabba the Hutts? Yes, I know it's supposed to be a light-hearted judgment at Americans and consumerism in general. How very cutting-edge of them! This has only been the judgment thrown at Americans for at least twenty years.My favorite silly moment in this very short-sighted movie is the future portraying the humans' return to Earth, which is shown during the credits. A utopia featuring a green and flourishing Earth is seen. Humans are seen fishing with the help of robots, farming, etc... but no factories building said robots are shown, no energy sources for the robots, no houses for the people. Is Pixar serious? With technology comes waste. Heck, with human life comes waste. So it has been ever since the first human set foot on this Earth, so it will ever be. Anyone showing otherwise is painfully short-sighted and ignorant.Enough of this mindless eco-babble already! We all want and need nature and we need to take care of it, but we all want luxuries and need technology, too. There should be a happy medium; there probably never will be. Hey, I have an idea to chew on -- where would Pixar be without the trucks and planes shipping its movies to movie theaters all over the world? Or the cars and SUVs that its animators drive to work every day? Or the movie-goers who drove to theaters to watch Wall-E, the trucks that delivered that popcorn they so blithely bought? This is arm-chair preaching. It will affect nothing. It only feeds into the same well-oiled machine it hypocritically decries.Here's another thought. Who did they make this movie for? If it's for kids, it's too long and boring for them. If it's for adults, it's too simple. Commercials seemed made to appeal to the younger crowd, which was misleading. I'm honestly shocked people DO like it to such an incredible degree.All this movie is is a heavy-handed morality tale related in a series of frustrating Pixar shorts, headed by a cute little robot who simply can't carry the weight of it. Some movies, like Ghibli films mentioned beforehand, manage to teach these themes without effort. After watching My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away, you want to see pristine forests; you want to make sure the rivers are clean. My Neighbor Totoro inspired the Japanese to set aside a special reserve of pristine forests and it didn't have to beat anyone over the head with Captain Planet theology to do it.I don't need or want lots of action or explosions or shiny things. All the Ghibli films I've seen and enjoyed do not rely on heavy-handed plots, for example; they rely on delicate, delicious character development. That's why most of them succeed where Wall-E fails; Wall-E is just not that complex. It offers nothing that hasn't been seen before. It goes from point A to point B to point C, character unchanging, simply adorable -- as though cuteness and slapstick could carry a 98-minute long movie!I hope Pixar moves forward and makes something a little more substantial next time, hopefully with the deep characterization I loved in Finding Nemo and The Incredibles.</review>

<review id="6601">The router works OK as a router, but their port forwarding system did not meet my expectations.  What they call "port forwarding" in their documentation means that you can't forward a message on a router port to a different port on an internal IP address.  I wanted to forward port 991 to port 80 on one IP address and port 992 to port 80 on a different computer.  Their documentation seemed to say the unit would do that, but it won't.  It insists on having the same inbound port number and forwarded port number.They have a device which will do what I want, but it costs 3 times as much.Read the documentation carefully before buying their unit.That's not Amazon's fault, they didn't write the documentation.</review>

<review id="6605">I bought this for my quadruped baby and within 25 minutes, she had climbed out of it. I suppose it works better for babies than puppies. Frankly, I was really disappointed.

<review id="6607">We have purchased other Drinkwell products and have been very satisfied with them.  I think we got a lemon this time.  We set up the fountain and it worked properly the first day but, at some point overnight, the vacuum holding the water in the reservoir released and we found the counter and floor covered in water.  We checked all the parts and the assembly of same and tried again several times but were not successful in getting the water to remain in the reservoir for even a few minutes.  The seller attempted to correct the problem but to no avail.  Please don't let this review sour your opinion of the entire Drinkwell line or even this product!

<review id="6612">After reading David McCollough's truly inspiring John Adams, I was eagerly awaiting the HBO Mini-series. I was hugely disappointed.  It seems HBO was hell bent on an agenda to almost totally distort the image of this passionate patriot. Several episodes in the book were particularly inspiring, as they offered a measure of John Adam's  dedication to our fledgling country. One was his determination to travel with his company a thousand miles by mule to Paris after the Sensible could not make it to its intended port and needed to let the John Adam's party off the coast of Spain. In the miniseries, John Adams and John Quincy just appear in Paris. Another episode involved negotiations with the British over the details of Independence. These negotiations included defining the boundaries of United States territory, navigation rights on the Mississippi, debts, fishing rights off Newfoundland and compensation to the loyalists. Adams insisted on America's position on all these issues and won. Most impressive was John Adam's absolute insistence that the British recognize the United States before any negotiations could take place. He stood strong on this point, in spite of the Continental Congress's direction to avoid this issue. These were truly inspiring episodes which  would be the stuff of imaginative genius, but they are especially glorious because they are the actual accomplishments of this truly great man. For reasons that make no sense, HBO completely disregarded them both.HBO's depiction of John Adams as a person was of one not recognized in the book. John Adams was clearly the fire and passion behind Independence, a truly great patriot, a loving husband and father and a faithful friend. HBO's John Adams comes off as a humorless, peevish, arrogant toad, guided to any positive accomplishment only buy the hand of his wife. In fact HBO's Abigail is so prominent in the miniseries, she at times seems to hold the central role. I grew increasingly weary of Abigail being continually lionized in contrast to the HBO's deeply flawed version of our second president.  Shame on HBO!A great man - a great book - a disastrous miniseries.</review>

<review id="6613">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      What a disappointment New Moon was!  After being totally enchanted with Twilight, I couldn't wait to see where this sequel would lead.  I am stunned a young author like Meyer would portray a young woman in the 21st century so weak, meek, and unlikable!  Bella is a whiny, ungrateful, mentally unstable, incapable brat, utterly dependent on a boyfriend!  YUCK!!  Sorry all you Edward lovers out there, but he's not much better than Bella!  He leaves her then tries to kill himself when he thinks she is dead, what an idiot!  I will definately not let my young daughters read this book when they grow up, these characters are morons.  The only character I liked in this book was Jacob.  He is interesting and sweet, and a good friend to Bella.  Why he is attracted to her I don't understand based on her personality.  I won't be buying the third or fourth book in this series, I've had enough.</review>

<review id="6617">I actually make a living writing reviews. Not of pet products, but audio-recording equipment. I saw the Furminator ads on TV, and then started researching on the net, where I wound up here at Amazon.I have a Border Collie who sheds like BC's like to shed. We'd moved away from our usual groomer, and I wanted a solution to cut down on the shedding. I bought the whole thing; hook, line, and sinker from PetSmart. Got the large Furminator Tool, Furminator Shampoo, and Furminator Conditioner. $100 I plunked down - 'cause we love our dog, and nothing is too good for her. : )It was the biggest waste of $100 I've ever spent.I used everything according to the instructions. I even spoke with someone at PetSmart about it. It took some hair off my dog - but I could have done that with my hand.We just moved back to our old area, and our dog is now back at her regular groomer - and looking more beautiful than ever. I even asked the groomer about the Furminator - thinking I would offer her mine to try out. She opened a draw and pulled one out that she'd gotten at a trade show. She said - point blank - that the Furminator was no good. She'd used it a couple of times, and it had been sitting in her drawer ever since.Unfortunately, my wife threw out the bag with the receipt, so there's no possibility for sending all this junk back to Furminator for a refund.I don't know who the people here are who are writing these glowing reviews. I recommend products all the time. But I would not recommend the Furminator  or the shampoo or conditioner at all.</review>

<review id="6618">I purchased this shaver about one year ago.  I wanted something that could help shave and trim all of those hard to reach areas on the male body.  Here's what I found with this Philips personal male shaver. (Please note that I do not use it every day, maybe one time per week).The instrument is small and easy to manage.  It seems to hold a charge well.  It also works in the shower, but trying to snip and shave wet hair is not easy (usually it won't work).  It is best to do this while hair is dry.  Additionally, if you are using this machine to trim hair on your back, forget it, it is very hard to manage such a maneuver due to the shape and size of the device. The bad new is in the construction of the instrument.  If you apply to much pressure, the head or screen collapses on to itself.  At several points I had to pull the head apart, and rebuild the blade section using tweezers.  It was annoying and difficult.  I still don't know how long this repair will last.  This shave head of the machine is poorly built.If you plan on using this shaver often, don't buy it.  I use a regular Conair (pulg-in) shaver most of the time, its big but it always works.</review>

<review id="6619">I bought this camcorder for my backpacking trip on Mt. Whitney. I figured since the manufacturer claimed their product was waterproof/dustproof/shockproof (surprised there was no lens cover), that this would be a good fit for the environment I would be placing the camcorder in. It is very easy to use and the menu was easily figured out. I did record while it snowed and it performed fine afterward. However, what I wasn't prepared for was the poor and low quality of the pictures and video that I took on this trip. I was severely disappointed and had to spend time on Photoshop to make the photos look decent. The videos also had a lot of contrast and the sound quality on the videos were fuzzy and muffled. I liked the look, weight, easily handling and use but that's about it. I'm returning the product.</review>

<review id="6620">Works okay but needs a refill to complete the job. Needs a speed control.  It is bulky to handle and difficult to turn off while manipulating.  Would not buy another one.</review>

<review id="6621">I agree with every thing that "Eventide" said in her review.  What a terrible disappointment this book has been compared to the other three.  "Cop-out" doesn't even begin to describe how Meyer decided to wrap up her book.   And it doesn't even wait until the end to cop out - it starts in the first chapter.  I had to make myself read the rest.One additional critique:  the story from Jake's point of view, which takes up at least a third of the book, is entirely pointless.  The story is about Bella and it should be told from Bella's point of view - as it has always been.  To change mid-stream means that the author couldn't quite get her story across through Bella's eyes, and so she FORCED it out through Jake.  That should have been her clue right there to drop the story she was pushing and let the story tell itself - even if all the ends aren't tied up neatly.  If you stay with the characters long enough, the story will emerge from them and not from anxious publishers who are looking to make a quick buck.</review>

<review id="6622">I wish I had never brought this software!  I love my iMac, but since I installed this product, the computer has had nothing but problems. I am actually thinking about trashing the software and going back to the old 2004 version. What a wasted use of money, especially since it was a birthday present to myself!  I wish I had listened to the other reviews.</review>

<review id="6623">The only problem with these is that when I went to cut my son's hair along his neck line it actually cut his skin and caused him to bleed.  I have to use the small trimmer for finishing touches.  Also it appears that the blade is crooked.  I will probably remove the two large screws and see if there is any way to straighten them out rather than deal with the huge headache of trying to return the thing.</review>

<review id="6624">I did taxes manually last year (as a first year resident) and decided to go with TurboTax this year, as I thought it would save time and provide some guidance. This has not been the case! The interview format is for the most part easy to understand. However, for some of the questions you can't really tell where the information will end up in the form and there is limited guidance. At least the IRS forms have instructions for each line (not the case with some of the interview questions in TurboTax) so you can easily go wrong with TT. I discovered that the software calculated my depreciation incorrectly and that I can't change it. Furthermore there is a bug in the SW for my State return so that once I get through 75% of the interview questions, the software removes the extra payment I made with filing my extension (and it cant be undone once this has happened). Given the uncertainties, I will need to redo everything manually instead so the SW has been of limited use to me. I am surprised of all the positive reviews of TT. Surely many other must have encountered similar problems.</review>

<review id="6625">WARNING to anyone thinking about buying this product! Please understand that you will not be buying this product only RENTING it. If you do not renew every year the product stops working....COMPLETELY! I'm not just talking about updates, etc. It actually tells you that it has stopped working and it won't work unless you renew. I have just wasted more than 2 hours with Norton's online tech support. This is the case with ALL Norton products and I am quoting the tech.</review>

<review id="6626">Paid $39.00 w/shipping and it arrived yesterday.  So exciting!!  However, the DVD is very dull and I'm going to sell it on eBay.  I have a dance background and honestly, the routines aren't difficult (though some are kinda wacky) but there's no music while you're going through 40 minutes of walking through the routines.  For me, this reduces the value since it's the music that gets me going and makes it fun! Tracy herself doesn't seem to be having fun either. Maybe if she had Gwynneth or Madonna join her it would add some energy to the DVD.All of that said, I would buy Tracy's oufits if they were for sale.  Very original.</review>

<review id="6627">This is my husbands account but I am writing the review.I just finished reading the first two boos. I have to be honest I skipped the whole Jacob thing and went straight to the Edward part.Who cares about Jacob we all want Edward and Bella.I couldnt understand how after all she suffered with losing him and giving up her life to save him and getting him back that Meyers had the nerve to throw in Jacob who was just a friend. After she was so stubborn about having made her decision.  I did notice they never had fun together, I would have liked to see them do more human things together since Edward missed out dying at such a young age but instead they always argued, she always wanted more. It started getting old. She did mention wanting to marry and secretly hoped he would one day ask but when Edward finally asks she flips out.  The beauty of the first book, the forbidden love, the passion is why we all bought the second book. But by the end of New Moon I was actually embarrassed that I was reading the book, it started getting petty. The one thing Bella wanted was Edward she got him, why all the whining? Dont like where its going. Wont be buying The Eclipse.I really hope the last one goes back to the passion of the first one.</review>

<review id="6628">I have been using this razor for about 3 months now. First off, the single blade is absolutely useless, it cuts nothing, it's just a gimmick. This however isnt that bad of an issue because in 90% of the replacement blades, I have gone to change the blade to find all this goop (presumably glue) all over the blade, with the single blade missing! Factor this in with the previously mentioned problems, as well as the fact that the green lubricant or whatever it is simply rinses right off of the blade head under the faucet, and it becomes pretty clear Gillette is selling this product based on gimmickry rather than quality. I feel I have given this product ample time to make sure the problems werent a fluke, but after going through literally 20 or so replacement blades, I think it's time to call a spade a spade. I shave my head and my face both, and have more frequent problems with nicks and cuts than other razors, and even with a fresh blade, many times it feels as though I'm shaving my face/head with a sharp rock. needless to say this will be the last gillette product I purchase.</review>

<review id="6629">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      Yikes, this certainly was not a very good movie. There were a couple of good action scenes in the beginning and end, but most of the movie was garbage. Shia Whoever is a beyond terrible actor(reference the cringefully bad Disturbia if there is any question on that fact...)and the script was completely terrible as well. Just the thought of this kid likely ruining the new Indiana Jones movie is very depressing also. The characters were shallow and predictable, the rebel girlfriend, the poser computer programmers, the oblivious adults and authority figures. A script this bad, with this big of a budget, and it can only be a Michael Bay movie.  What a waste. I wouldn't buy this one if it was in the 5 dollar bin at Wal-Mart. I used to love the Transformers cartoons growing up and I was hoping for an entertaining blockbuster. I went in with low expectations and was hoping to be pleasantly surprised, but it was so bad it actually made me want to turn it off, but I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't.  Starscream, Bumblebee, and Optimus Prime will always rule so a I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1. But that is a stretch.</review>

<review id="6630">The Drinkwell fountain is an above-average product (I rated it four stars), but the filtering system is pretty much useless.The filter fits vertically inside the fountain and may be effective in cleaning the water for a day or so, after which the water becomes cloudy (or maybe the filter is, indeed, totally useless and the water appears to be clear and clean for that one day merely because it was clean to start with). However, grime and slime will build up throughout the fountain, including the filter, really, really fast, and once that happens, water will simply flow on top of the filter, instead of through it. At that point, I guess one can do one of two things:[1] Clean/scrub the filter. While common-sensical, that does not seem to work because there is just no way to clean a used filter throughly enough. When putting a cleaned filter back inside the fountain (after also cleaning the entire fountain and changing the water), the water gets cloudy again in seconds. Guess where the cloudiness comes from? The "cleaned" filter! Bottom line: Filters cannot be cleaned well enough, which brings me to the second option.[2] Change the filter. Again, common sense, except you would need to do that every 2-3 days. At about $10 for a 3-pack, wouldn't you rather use that money to buy premium food for your pets or toward their health insurance?These days, I use my Drinkwell fountain without a filter, but I only use my own filtered drinking water to fill it. I change the water and scrub/wash the fountain every four days (with dishwashing solution, but avoid using the solution on the pump, though). The water never gets cloudy during those four days. (Four days seem to be a good compromise between my laziness and ensuring that my pets have access to clean water all the time.)I wish I could find a pet drinking fountain with a truly effective filtering system at an affordable price, but I doubt there is one on market right now.</review>

<review id="6631">I have used DNS for about 7 years. I started with version 6 as I recall. I recently upgraded to DNS 10.0 which is a total POS. Besides running much slower and less accurately than 9.0, it appeared to crash the RAID system on my primary work machine and cost me about $1000 of IT expense to get the machine working again. I am back to 9.0 and wouldn't recommend 10.0 to anyone.</review>

<review id="6632">Very horrible product.  Recently purchased this yoke and was experiencing phantom key presses like many who have already stated.  Exchanged it for a new one and still experiencing the same problem.  Apparently Saitek has no intentions on fixing the problem.</review>

<review id="6633">My pets were used to having their nails trimmed by a dremel drill. So I thought this might be quieter, work better for the long haired dogs because of the cover protector and be faster.  This was not the case.  I have a Great Dane, 5 Pomeranians, and 2 cats.  It is not near powerful enough to trim even the 3 pound Pom fast enough.  If I wanted to see how long trimming could take, then maybe.  My pets have a small window of patience with trimming and I have to be fast, quick, with as little vibration as possible.  This tool stressed out my pets, because it took way too long.  I will stick to my dremel.</review>

<review id="6634">I have spent this weekend trying to establish the boundaries of this system. The first attempt took a little while however we placed the flags as instructed. Fitted the collar to the dog & went outside for the 1st training session. I found it very hard to hear the beeping once the collar was on my dog however I soon realised that even before we were within 2 feet of the flags she was being shocked. I felt terrible. we took the collar off and realised that the boundaries had changed. The instructions say that it can fluctuate however we were never able to get it to beep in the same place twice. Sometimes we would get one beep & it would just stop. We tried to place the transmitter in three different locations today and each gave poor results. There were areas between flags placed 6 feet apart that we never heard a beep and could just keep on walking. I am more than willing to spend the time training my dog but I could not even set the boundaries. We changed the height of the transmitter, moved our car out of the way, moved anything we felt that may be affecting it without success. I am sorry but it did not work well for me. I will be returning the system.</review>

<review id="6635">This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)      If Tropic Thunder were half as funny as it obviously thinks it is, then it might have been something special.  Despite the talent involved with this movie (Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr., Jack Black, Tom Cruise, etc.) it seems as though everyone involved knows how brilliantly talented and funny they are and how funny the premise is and all they have to do is show up and the movie will be great.  Uh...wrong.  You actually have to work at comedy...it's hard!One of the main problems with the movie is that it is torn between what kind of comedy it wants to be.  Part of it wants to be a stinging criticism of the entire movie industry and the other half wants to be a shameless, raunchy comedy that will offend everyone.  It doesn't succeed on either front.  The satire of the movie feels dated and obvious.  Who doesn't know that Hollywood is full of self absorbed actors, ruthless studio heads and sleazy agents?  The part of the movie that wants to go for pure raunchiness and politically incorrect humor doesn't quite work because the movie's idea of this type of humor seems to be to use as much profanity as possible.  There's no inspired insanity behind all of the R rated shenanigans.  If the movie is trying to cash in on the post-Apatow comedy landscape, it seems to be missing the point.Not that the movie is terrible.  There are some funny moments, some chuckles and grins, but no belly laughs.  The two key performances that have received rave reviews, Tom Cruise's heartless studio exec and Downey Jr's method actor aren't quite as brilliant as they've been made out to be.  Cruise, and a lot of critics, apparently thought that simply yelling and using profanity was comic gold.  I disagree.  As for Robert Downey Jr, his transformation into an African-American soldier is quite amazing, but only from a visual standpoint.  The character that Downey creates is mostly forgettable, just like most of this overblown and overhyped comedy.</review>

<review id="6637">I was very disappointed with this book.The 3 books prior to it in the twilight series were the books that captivated and enticed readers.This final book really destroyed the series. I wish i hadn't read the book.In the original books the main characters were very relatable and the plot and ideas were almost believable.This book had so many plot holes and very poorly thought out ideas. Also it was rediculously unbelievable. In many parts, repetative as well. This book was very graphic and its not for the faint hearted. I recommend not reading this book so you do not ruin the other 3 twilight books.</review>

<review id="6638">I am an avid coffee drinker and bought this machine with hopes of a dependable coffee maker in the morning.  What an absolute dissapointment!  The first time brewing the brew basket clogged creating quite a mess of coffee grounds.  Next effort produced quite a leaking problem.  The next morning the machine completely shorted out.  What an absolute waste of time and money.  My impressions of Black & Decker have been dropping over the years, but I thought "how can they mess up such a simple design?"  Surprise!  In my estimation, Black & Decker has reached a new low with inferior products.  Avoid this coffee maker and save yourself the headaches.</review>

<review id="6639">I gave this 2 stars since I thought this would be the perfect external drive for traveling with my notebook book but failed to work with my notebook. When I tried to install this on the USB port of my notebook, it caused my notebook to slow its performance to a crawl. I later figured out that this drive needs a &quot;high power&quot; USB port. For those that don't know, there are &quot;high power&quot; and &quot;low power&quot; USB ports. There is nothing on the box of this drive that says it only works on high power USB ports. Not only that, Windows doesn't report the problem back to the user. What a waste of time and money. I later found out that Iomega makes a PC Card that is a high power USB port so that you can use this drive. Gad! What good is USB if it is not &quot;universal&quot;.</review>

<review id="6640">I bought this keyboard because I already owned a Saitek Eclipse I and was totally satisfied with that, having used it for more than two years daily at work with absolutely no complaints. Anyone who sits down to use my keyboard comments on how good the keys feel, and how solid the keyboard itself is.Anyway, I bought the v2 so that I could synchronize my keyboard layouts between home and work --- big mistake. Just under a year into using the Saitek Eclipse II, several of the keys (o, u) have started working only intermittently. If you check out the reviews on Newegg, and maybe on Amazon as well, you will see others reporting bad keys with the Eclipse II. Meanwhile, the Eclipse I is still going strong; although I must report that I accidentally got a drop of hand sanitizer on one of my keys, and apparently the back-lighting is accomplished via a silver coating (black on the v2) on transparent plastic keys. As a result, my 'c' is now a smudged blue blob, the silver having slightly worn off from the alcohol in the hand sanitizer. I wouldn't recommend buying the Eclipse II, though the tri-color lights are nice (though a bit dim), and audio controls are handy, but I would suggest buying the Eclipse I instead.</review>

<review id="6641">Well, after reading all the hype and me having multiple Australian Shepherds I decided to buy one. After using it for 10 min on each dog, I have come to the conclusion this thing is "JUNK" my rake and slicker brush removes far more shedding fur then this could do. I really wish I could have borrowed one first before wasting my hard earned money.  The only thing I can see is it will remove the top coat, and a cheap shedding tool works better for that too!I decided to try this again, and if you really press hard it works better. It really requires more then 10 minutes if you plan to do a double coated animal.</review>

<review id="6642">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      I was a big fan of Twilight.  When I read that there was a sequel out, I ran out and bought it.  But this book was a bit of a letdown.Not half as much action-y stuff happening in the first book.  It's just the tale of a desperate girl who keeps hurting her self for a boy.  Don't get me wrong it was well written and everything.  But I kind of felt let down at the end.  I think it deserved less following as it did. But I will keep my out for the 3rd book and pray that it is a bit more interesting.</review>

<review id="6643">I was given the first book by a workmate who has been raving about the series. After reading Twilight I had to ask her. "It's an interesting plot - but is this supposed to be a romance novel?" She laughed and said she didn't think so - but I should wait until I read the rest of the books!.Unfortunately, after reading New Moon I still felt the same way. Pages upon pages of the same over used descriptions of Edward. I found that the only thing that kept me flipping the pages was my hope that Bella would become a vampire. I skipped entire paragraphs of needless romance novel garbage to get to something of actual substance. Even more unfortunate is that Eclipse has been ... more of the same. Endless ranting of how gorgeous Edward is. Edwards eternal love for Bella, which is a mystery to me at least due to her very weak character development. I almost think SM purposely makes Bella a bore to hear about to further accentuate how rediculous Edwards attraction to her is...except for the fact that she 'smells good.' Anyway - this book is alright if you plan on reading the rest in the series - just don't expect to be blown away by anything you haven't heard already. My only request to SM would be to GET ON WITH IT! This series has great potential without using the same old rehashed love song. More creativity - less repetitivness.</review>

<review id="6644">I've used Turbo Tax for several years and decided to save $10 this year and try TaxCut.  What a major disappointment!

I'll NEVER purchase or  use TaxCut again!</review>

<review id="6645">This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) [HD DVD] (HD DVD)      I can't believe anyone likes this movie.  So lame.  5 autobots vs 5 decepticons.  Wow.  Epic.  The robots were horribly designed.  I could barely tell they were robots after they transformed (a process that appears like it should take several hours).  And autobots are f'ing buicks and oldsmobiles.  C'mon, Jazz is a freaking pontiac instead of a porsche?  Starscream was okay, and it was nice to use the original Optimus' voice, but those are about the only redeeming features of this typical Michael Bay crapfest.  Bring on the 1080p release of the animated masterpiece, "Transformers: The Movie!"</review>

<review id="6646">This camcorder is all that is promised.  It is a very cheap way to have motion capture capabilities.  The picture and sound quality are good but it is almost impossible to keep the camera steady during filming.  I would recommend either buying a digital camera with video capabilities or spend a little bit more and get a camcorder that has image stabilization.  Another downside is that the videos are not compatible with iMovie '08.</review>

<review id="6647">Bought this a few months ago expecting better performance than a Belkin or D-Link 802.11b routers.  Upgraded the house phones to the 5.8Ghz frequency to eliminate interference that may have plagued the other routers.  Despite that, the performance has been horrible!!!  It loses connection at least 8 or 9 times a day, and the only way to recover is to physically disconnect the power supply and reconnecting it a few seconds later to reboot the router.  Possibly may be due to use of cheap transmitters by linksys.</review>

<review id="6649">I almost never write a review for a product online.  In this case, I felt obligated.In absolute terms, Office 2007 is an incredibly useful piece of software.  But who cares?  The relevant point here is that the 2007 suite is a HUGE downgrade from previous versions.  The interfaces are much more complicated and less useful, and the .docx extension in Word is problematic.

<review id="6652">I bought this from a local retailer since it was the only one in stock, and was so disappointed I returned it. It made sherbet (milk-based) with no problem at all, but I've really been craving sorbet, and the freezer bucket simply wasn't cold enough to do the job--it chilled my mix, but didn't even turn it to slush before it had warmed... at which point I had no choice but to put the bucket back in the freezer for another 9 hours, only to repeat the cycle several times before giving up.</review>

<review id="6653">I bought this at Best Buy a few weeks ago after reading great reviews online.  The quality of the high-def video and the pocket size of it were the main selling points for me.  Unfortunately, I could not get the FlipShare software to install on my laptop.  I spent three weeks going back and forth by email with their customer support (no phone tech support), where they basically kept giving me the same step-by-step instructions over and over to no avail.  Finally gave up and was able to install the software on my wife's computer.  Upon playback, you can visibly see a stutter in the video every couple of seconds.  It became so annoying so quickly, coupled with the tech support issues, that I finally returned it today.  Unfortunately outside of the 14 day window for camcorder returns at Best Buy so now I have a credit, but no camcorder.</review>

<review id="6654">My review does not deal with TurboTax, just the ability to download TurboTax through Amazon.In my case, I could not download TurboTax. First of all you have to download the Amazon downloader program. That I downloaded fine, and it installed successfully - or so it said.But the Amazon downloader then was not able to connect to download the software. On calling Amazon tech support, they had no suggestions on how to fix the issue (My windows firewall + software firewall were switched off, as was my virus software, and my router firewall), and so the tech support team promptly refunded me my money.It's too bad - simple enough to download their downloader software, just not the actual software in my case. But I admit from other reviews this is not a widespread problem for other users.I'd advise giving it a shot, but have a backup plan just in case.</review>

<review id="6657">Were it not for the very good return policies of Amazon, this would have been my worst online puchase, ever.My first external drive arrived and would not mount via the e-SATA connection. I sent an e-mail to Accomdata, which says on its Web site it will respond in 3-5 days. I sent my note weeks ago; I have yet to hear back.So I requested a second external drive. Same deal: wouldn't mount via e-SATA. So on my own dime I took my PC to my local shop to make sure I didn't have bad hardware. Nope. My PC was fine, but when they ran diagnostics on the my brand-new replacement, they discovered the drive itself was bad. And I got to pay for gaining this knowledge.I can forgive one bad item. What I can't forgive is shoddy customer service and a second unit that was as bad as the first. Caveat emptor.</review>

<review id="6658">This device did not operate with my laptop, presumably because of power requirements.  A WD service representative promised to send a proper power cord to address the issue.  They did not do so.  Lack of an appropriate cord and carrying case seriously reduce the attractiveness of this otherwise useful portable hard drive.</review>

<review id="6659">I would not recommend this router to anyone. At first it worked okay even with sporadic connections. I could never hold connection steady for a few hours. It was constantly disconnecting and looking for connection. If you are like me who listens to online radio and that would cause a constant problem of disconnecting and connecting again and again. The worst happened after 7 months, when it completely stopped working. I am not sure what to recommend as I had two wired Linksys routers which only lasted 12 months each. I don't know what the problem with them but they simply stopped working. So look else where for your router needs. Help Support is non-existent with both linksys and netgear. If this things goes down, you pretty much on your own.</review>

<review id="6660">I bought this MP3 player within the last 3 weeks. It was great the first week, I enjoyed the fact it wasn't too big or bulky, and was easy to use. However, after that first week I noticed it often would not power up when I tried to turn it on. And now it has begun to shut itself off at random. I never used it excessively, less than an hour at a time, not every day certainly. No idea why it has suddenly gone bad.</review>

<review id="6661">The first three times I used the chopper to chop garlic, it went well.  The fourth time, it wouldn't chop.  A rip-off, at least as regards the chopper, and while the blender still works, I have doubts it will work much longer.I expect never to buy a Cuisinart product again.  Kitchenaid for me.</review>

<review id="6662">I'm sending this back. I've used MacinTax, then TurboTax for 15 years, with increasing dissatisfaction, as more useless junk gets added into the program. Now to discover, after getting the product and performing an apparently normal installation, that it will not open... and I cannot use it...is the last straw. In very small type on its cover, and on the start up sheet INSIDE the package, is the information that it will work only on OS 10.4 or higher. OS 10.3.9 is a still-popular OS X operating system. This Intuit decision is TOO much. Goodbye Intuit.</review>

<review id="6663">I bought the Frontline Plus for my dog from The Pet Plaza one month ago. My dog (Tse-Tsu breed) is only 11 pounds. After I tried 2 dosage in one month, my dog still has lots of fleas. The Frontline does not works for my dog.</review>

<review id="6664">The 2 piece design is great but as I experienced with this hand blender.... I have only used it 5 times and the plastic ribbed socket that drives the metal shaft for the blade has been rounded off b/c its so soft. So What this means is that the design is partially great, stong motor, strong blade but the weakest point is the plastic that drives everything. If you are making soup or something soft then it will never be a issue, if you intend to hit bits and pieces of frozen fruit then you will run into probelms. Again I love the handblender but I am very very disappointed that they would use plastic to drive a metal shaft.</review>

<review id="6665">I like the idea of a gaming keyboard, but this one just doesn't fit the bill. Regardless of intended function, a keyboard needs to "feel" properly - tactile feedback from key strokes is the primary criterion for rating a keyboard, in my opinion at least. I know this is subjective, but for me the keyboard just feels too mushy, and key presses are too long.As for features, the display is a novelty, as the games I've played showed only basic data that I could configure on my monitor, and I'd rather keep my eyes on the monitor than look down at my keyboard for that info. The extra row of keys on the left side were useful for several games, and the blue backlighting looks cool.I replaced the G15 with the Razer Tarantula, which feels much more crisp and precise to me.</review>

<review id="6666">i think i need a replacement, as my wireless/LAN disconnects every 25-30 minutes and than i have to restart it to get it working</review>

<review id="6667">This product is terrible and is only reliable if it works out of the box and fits into   the simple brain-dead configurations provided by the vendor. I own other Linksys products which are excellent and have owned other wireless devices that have worked flawlessly and this is NOT one of them. The negative reviews regarding support and the awful and extremely slow installation program are spot on. If this device works for you great leave it alone and just run it, and don't ever be tempted to depress the so-called reset button (for factory defaults) or you will be hauling this hunk of junk back to where you bought it if there is a return policy.</review>

<review id="6668">People are having tons of problems with the WRT54G Version 5, just try googling "WRT54G Version 5".  For some reason this version does not play well with DSL.  I installed it and it cut my connection speed by 2/3.  Tech support was absolutely no help and it took a full hour of wrangling to get them to issue an RMA.  Not sure what they will replace this one with -- probably just another of the same that also won't work.</review>

<review id="6670">This is a wellcrafted, sturdy little device.  Problem is, it is about useless for ear hair.  It trims nothing, nothing at all.  Even worse than battery-powered rotary trimmers.

I got one for $10 in a mall and then found a knockoff in the Dollar Store!</review>

<review id="6671">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      The spent way too much time trying to make you care about the story, which no one does.  Stick to the action - that's what comic books are about.</review>

<review id="6672">I was so excited about this product.  I'd tasted the coffee and it was pretty good and easy and quick to make.  HOWEVER, this machine makes the most awful, LOUD sound while heating water...it's disturbing to hear in the morning, while others are sleeping especially!  Keurig's customer service is terrible, too!!  Very unprofessional and not helpful at all!!  It took 4 different customer service representatives - and that was after making appointments with reps, who would fail to answer their phone at our scheduled appointment time, even though I had rearranged my day to talk to them when they were open and I was home with my coffee maker, another frustrating aspect of this purchase - before one listened to the sound my coffee maker was making, only to tell me that was normal and maybe I could put a mouse pad under it to help with the sound.  Ummmm....no THANKS!  And even with doing that, it was still ridiculously LOUD!  I do NOT recommend this product!  A $100 coffee maker should be awesome....not disturbingly LOUD!</review>

<review id="6673">The design is poor, very difficult to fold and unfold.

<review id="6674">Like many others, I'd been a Norton fan for years.  I installed Norton 360 (with subscription, more on that later) last year on my Dell desktop w/3GHz processor and XP. It was okay at first, but making it do what I want, when I want, was always a challenge.  As time wore on, things got buggier, with frequent hangups and reboots (particularly with lots of windows open).  It wanted to scan everything daily no matter what my settings were.  I was ready to pitch the Norton when the recent offer for a free upgrade to version 2.0 appeared.  OK, let's give it a try.  Well, it did solve the scheduling problems, and would actually recognize my external drive and backup what I wanted.  But what a system hog!  Seemed like everything was running in the background all the time, with constant pop-ups to tell me every time it found something. (oh, good for you, Norton, now how do I turn this feature off?  Oh, I can't, eh?).  Overall, it slowed everything down to the point that I thought I had an old 486 system.  Yuk.  Out with Norton, in with Kaspersky 7.0, and life is good again.Be weary of the Norton automatic renewal feature.  As I was tranitioning, I got the daily pop-up warning that my subscription would expire in however many days.  OK, I've got time to cancel.  No, I didn't.  With 15 days left on the counter, Norton automatically renewed my subscription.  Fooey.Bottom line: Norton tries to do too much, all the time, bogging my system down.  I have moderate computer skills, but am not a techie like many of the posters.  Norton pushes this as a no-brainer solution, but I disagree - you have to dig into the process to make it do what you want - maybe.  But the big deal was the slowing of the system.</review>

<review id="6675">I had a series of electronic body composition measurements taken at a gym over a period of months. The practitioner used electrodes all over my body, with skin preparation as would be used for an EKG, and still the variation in readings was far greater than could be possible, thus invalid. As others have said, get calipers and learn how to use them.Also, people, forget about BMI. This was a measurement developed to study POPULATIONS, and never intended for the evaluation of individuals. Use common sense. How can a value that considers only weight and height be a valid reflection of an individual's health and fitness? Muscle is denser than fat, so an individual with minimal muscle will show a lower BMI than a heavily-muscled one of the same stature. Are we to believe that the lower BMI in this example indicates the healthier of the two? Nonsense!</review>

<review id="6677">This review is from: Changeling [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)      This is a very boring and pointless movie. Don't waste your time. To see Eastwood's best movie, rent "Flags of Our Fathers." (I almost walked out of Changeling.)</review>

<review id="6678">I was so disappointed with this installment of the series.  If you read the first two you will certainly want to read Eclipse but don't have high expectations.  Bella was annoying (in that she wasn't very ethical) and the other characters weren't as dynamic. This edition had no depth, I found myself just glancing at the pages instead of reading them.The author didn't capture me like she did in the first two books...it leaves me with the feeling that she churned this one out for the money and/or to meet contract obligations.The 5 star ratings were surely submitted by the authors friends- a tactic that many authors use on Amazon.  That leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth.......</review>

<review id="6680">If you have reached this page looking for a reference to the Zojirushi, here is my delima:   I purchased this machine and wish I hadn't.It looks and seems like it would be a good purchase, but when I got it home and tried baking several loaves, they were hard as a rock and wouldn't release from the pan.  I called the company and they sent me new blades.  That helped with turning the loaves out, but they were not eatable.  The crust was very hard and the bread was so terrible, I gave it to the birds.  I kept calling the company and they finally said to contact the sender and get my money back....thank goodness, I returned it and by recommendation of one of the South Beach forums, was advised to purchase the Breadman Ultimate.   I hope this saves whoever reads this some time and aggrivation!   Happy Shopping!</review>

<review id="6681">I was initially impressed by this line of razors and its blades, but no more.  Having owned and used one of these razors for 1 and 3/4 years I won't be buying another one.  The blades work great the first month.  Ok the second and third month.  But then quickly go down hill.  Won't shave my beard worth beans anymore.  I found myself returning more and more to my Gillette Fusion razor with increasing frequency each day; first to "touch up" what the Norelco missed, then inevitably for full shaving creme and razor shaves.  If you want to keep using the Norelco it means you have to buy replacement blades far more often then you should; making the total cost of ownership excessively unreasonable.</review>

<review id="6682">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      First, I want to say, that I love the 80's Transformers show and used to watch it before and after school, so I was really looking forward to this movie, and also taking my kids to see it who didn't get to watch it growing up like me. However, I was extremely disappointed in the makers of this movie, especially with the scriptwriter and everyone above him who approved the script. There is so much foul mouth, sexual content garbage that is constantly being spoken by these characters throughout the movie that I really regretted having bought the dvd for my kids. In fact, it is now in the trash. Transformers is marketed for children of all ages, with all of its merchandise, toys, clothes, etc., however, as a warning to all responsible parents out there, the dialogue of this movie is nothing but trash, and is nothing like the 80's wholesome cartoon. It's like the perverted writer of this script is desperate himself for that kind of intimate attention that he had to sprinkle it throughout the entire movie to corrupt young, impressionable minds. It's a real shame, because transformers should have been made more wholesome, and family friendly like the spider-man movies are, not where you have to cover your children's ears constantly. This movie should have been made more responsibly, because although its listed as PG-13, it is marketed toward small children as well. My 5 year old wants to see Bumblebee after wanting the little toys from the store. Too bad many of Bumblebee's friends have a disturbing potty mouth in this movie which should have been family friendly. Stay away from this trash, it is not for kids.</review>

<review id="6683">Buyer beware! I bought one of these from a big box store when I saw the low price and wanted to upgrade my old G-class router. The setup was needlessly complex and the signal coming from the DIR-615 continually fluctuated between weak and just under maximum. I suppose I could reluctantly recommend this router for those who just do light web surfing and email, but if you need a strong, fast wireless network for gaming, large downloads, work purposes, etcetera... spend more money on a better quality router.</review>

<review id="6684">I started watching this and lost interest as season one went on. That's too bad because the production values are there for this to have been much better. It should have been much more captivating. Instead I just felt like I was being strung along as the writers made it all up as it went down hill.</review>

<review id="6686">I purchased this mixer because it was highly rated by Cooks Illustrated. It is so noisy I could only use it when my family was not nearby.

<review id="6687">After looking for the next greatest cat litter pan invention, I came across this.  I read the reviews which were by and large really positive about the product.  So I thought maybe it really was that simple to come up with a $50 product that does what you want vs. a $150 motorized litter pan which have their own issues.  Unfortunately it simply is not what many of the reviews here indicate it is.  I'm not an engineer but I can assure you my pan is properly assembled.  Sure it's easy enough to roll on the side to sift out the litter but guess what...IT LEAKS!  So every time I roll it, I then have to dig out the broom to sweep up the litter it spills all over my floor.  And don't fool yourself in thinking that this pan will forever remove your requirement to scoop litter again because it won't.  For clumps that are stubbornly stuck to the sides/bottom of the pan or too firm to sift, guess who's going to be removing the lid and scooping them out?  Unless you've taught your cat some amazing tricks, it's going to be you!  So after trying this pan and the $150 motorized pan which lasted a whopping 3 months before the motor burned out, I'm going back to the $15 deep sided plain old Rubbermaid pan.  And I'll keep dreaming for the day that someone invents the ideal cat litter/auto scooping pan...or that my cats stop laughing at me long enough for me to teach them how to scoop and clean up after themselves.</review>

<review id="6690">I knew that I had excess contributions to my IRA, and bought Turbo Tax to help me with filling out the forms properly.  When it properly calculated that I had $1000 in excess contributions, it did not ask me if I wanted to withdraw that excess before the deadline.  Instead, it just gave me a 10% penalty.  Since I planned to withdraw the excess, the penalty doesn't apply.  The only way I found around this was to say I only contributed $3000 versus $4000, which may be what Turbo Tax intended.  Also, it's providing no help in how to handle the earnings that I have to withdraw.  It's assuming that I have a 1099-R, but I won't have that for a while, because I can't withdraw the excess contributions until after 15 April.  But I need to estimate my earnings when I request an extension and estimate my taxes.In short, I had to do too much of the thinking and analysis and reading of IRS publications.</review>

<review id="6693">I installed Office 2007 as an "upgrade" from Office 2003. Word and Excel are OK - the user interface changes in Excel are a little annoying, but the XML capabilities (for pro version) are necessary, and I wrote it down to natural human resistance to change. Outlook 2007, however, was so slow as to be unusable.

<review id="6694">Apparently not.The book starts and ends with useless bickering. Edward returns here, and is 100x stupider than ever!!!! I thought that Meyer would redeem herself with this book, but no, the writing just got sloppier and more useless with each book. A note to Meyer- YOU NEED AN EDITOR WHO IS NOT YOUR HUSBAND. It took Meyer 700 pages to tell a story that could have been told in 300 pages.So yeah, pretty much, Edward is back. Jake has turned himself into a complete arse, and Bella's been accepted into University. Then a random new vampire in Seattle has been causing a lot of people to drop like flies, and the story evolves into a 700 page crapfest that you'll be going "is it over yet?" within the first 200 pages. I've grown to hate Edward more with each book because he just gets dumber and more ingenue as each chapterOh, and another thing- What's with all the positive reviews? They're all like 4 words and say the same thing. They don't say much about the book at all other than that was amazing. And I bet most of them have NOT read the book. LOTS of them make errors about the plot. And much of their titles are "I heart Edward!".Just awful. Do NOT waste your money. And to make it worse, there's a fourth book, which is even worse, called Breaking Dawn.</review>

<review id="6697">Ive used symantec products for over 10yrs.  Norton Systemworks was an awful resource hog yet I stuck with Symantec/Norton products into the 360 line because I grew so fond of their excellent Ad blocking software.With Norton 360 2.0, that feature was discontinued.  No (adequate) disclosure was given by Symantec that upgrading to 2.0 would uninstall my previous add-on pack and that the Ad Blocking would not be supported in the new 2.0 version.  After downloading t\he original add-on pack it failed to install w/ 2.o.  In fine print on a tech support forum on the symantec site, I learned that ad-blocking would no longer be offered or supported by symantec.  Im not much of a techie, other reviewers here are making valid points.  From a practical standpoint, removal of this feature is the straw that broke the camel's back for me.  No one from India even responded to my email to Symantec lamenting about the removal of this feature.  This company has seriously lost focus on it's customers.</review>

<review id="6698">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      Like others, I've been looking forward to seeing this supposed masterpiece. But after two and a half hours, you are left empty and confused.  Joker, the main antagonist who is seen working alone (though we're told there is an army of gangsters behind him), appears almost super-human.  He manages to rig a hospital full of explosives all while locked-up in prison, and the moment he escapes there is a seemingly endless set of events which he had already planned for, catching everyone off guard.  Then there is the character of district attorney, who after 20 years of fighting crime turns into a villain overnight (because his girlfriend got killed and half his face was burned).  Are we to believe that a man of such strong moral standing would be corrupt by a 4-minute motivational speech by the Joker (who, let us not forget, killed his beloved girlfriend).In the end, Batman disappears into the night, being hunted by a pack of K9s, and another moral line is spewed out "We must hunt him not because he should be hunted, but because.."  I forget the details.  The movie packs superheroes, action and constant barrage of philosophical and moral lines.  There are moments when three separate action scenes are going on at once, in three separate settings.  How can anyone keep track of it all? I'm usually spot-on with critics, but this movie just annoyed me.</review>

<review id="6699">I bought the netgear wireless router over cheaper alternatives because of its supposed higher quality.  The router, however, only gave me intermittent access to the internet.  I called netgear customer support numerous times, and after long waits, I received "solutions" that did not fix my problem.  After five (maybe more--I lost count) calls to customer support, I asked that netgear replace my defective router.   Netgear then put me on hold and after fifteen minutes no one had ever come back to my call so I hung up in disgust.  I definitely recommend against buying a netgear product if you think you will ever need true customer support.</review>

<review id="6700">This is about the worst case of consumer abuse I have seen.

<review id="6701">I bought this as an inexpensive and simple camcorder for the ski slopes.  I felt nervous about using an expensive device.  The following are my ramblings that I can think of real quick.  If it worked in cold weather, I would have given it 3.5-4 stars because on how inexpensive it is.The cold weather affects it, and would not power on for most of my efforts.  I stuck it closer in one of the inner pockets of my ski jacket, but the best I ever got was a 10 second clip on sunny days.I thought I had several 20 second clips, but it turned out that it locked up and never saved properly.  What a disappointing day it was on the ski slopes.I use it periodically during the summer without any major problems.  It has locked up from time to time, but taking the battery out and restarting seems to work.I hate the charger, though.  I don't think it is a standard usb device.  I tried repeatedly to recharge with my motorola usb charger that I use with my phone, and this device won't take the charge--although, it lights up appearing that it will / does.I would have preferred something more direct to mpeg4 such that I can put it directly to DVD, hddvd, or blueray.  However, I guess that is what software and a computer are good for.This unit also does not have an optical zoom--however, for the cost, it is understandable.  Aiptek appears to have a unit that costs a little more that has an optical zoom.My suggestion is if you are going to a cold environment, avoid this.  If you need something inexpensive, this is very impressive.  However, understand that this may lock up from time to time, and you may miss some shots.  So, definately it is not something that I would set it and forget it--rather, check up on it every 10 min to make sure it is running, and there is a stoping point, stop the recording, and start a new one such that you will know that you have captured that segment.</review>

<review id="6702">Caution:  Linksys hasn't updated its configuration software and websites to work with v. 5!!  After wasting two hours running the install CD and then Linksys's web-based configuration utilities and not getting the wireless router to work, I broke down and called their customer support line.  I spent a good hour on the phone with a Linksys technician (based in Manila) to manually configure the router to work with my ISP (Verizon DSL).  The on-line support programs that their customer service number refers you to (you're supposed to try these before you resort to a technician) didn't work with version 5; I found this out from the Linksys support folks.  That said, now that it's configured, it's working OK though I've not yet gotten the security features to work.  Also the Linksys technicians were quite knowledgeable and patient, so I have to give them kudos for their customer and technical support.  But it's clear that Linksys isn't ready for the rollout of this product.  In fact, the customer support person was surprised that v. 5 is out on the market already.  Leave it to Amazon to always have the latest release of these techology products!!</review>

They loved Transformers too!  But market placement does not a good movie make!!  The plot was weaker than 2% milk and the character development coulda been a Slurpee (translation: it SUCKED!!) There was plenty of action, but nothing to tie it all together and make us care.My adolescent daughter summed up the main character's existence as a constant attempt to get lucky with the cute mechanic chick who apparently had no reason to be there at all! Why couldn't they have developed the character of the hyper-cool cyberchick who figured out the transformers were there in the first place... now THAT woulda been a more entertaining movie!!  It hurts to see that such an average film got so many to rave about it.  I guess the marketing should get 5 stars!!!I'd take Iron Giant any day over this claptrap  :)All the best,Jay</review>

<review id="6708">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)      What garbage!  I got this version of the DVD for the Special Features, you know the stuff where they talk about how they made things, the cars, the suit, the sound and music, the stunts, costume, all that stuff.  Well, this version just didn't have that.  They had like 12 min of the making of!  That's it.  Music, Bat suit, and Bat pod.  Then the rest was an IMAX aspect ratio of some of the scenes in the movie, THE MOVIE THAT IS ON THE DISK ONE.  Why do I need to see those scenes again?  Then the rest of disk two is fake news stories called Gotham Tonight or something.  I figured that they just didn't make these features that I wanted to see, which I find hard to believe because they pretty much knew that it was going to be a big movie judging from the success of the first one, so where is the making of stuff?  (Not on this version so save yourself the trouble of looking here.)  So I start talking to my friend, and he has all the special features that I would like to see, but they are on Blue Ray.  WHAT A RIP OFF!  I did not pay the extra money for that.  I realize that the term "Special Features" is a pretty loose in definition, but they knew the stuff that I wanted to see, so they put that on the blue ray and gave me a bunch of trash.</review>

<review id="6709">DONT BUY IT!! I bought this bread maker as a christmas 2003 gift for my wife-and we still haven't been able to make good bread. We follow the directions EXACTLY from Panasonic's own book and even 2 other bread books I bought, we bought all the special premium &quot;bread machine&quot; flours and yeasts.......but total failures every time. It's always a different deformity each time we try. We have all kinds of other appliances that we regularly use just fine and this is the first time I've ever written a bad review. When I tried to call Panasonic I went through 6 &quot;options&quot; on my phone, then got a message saying the avg wait time was 90 minutes. They have yet to reply to my emails.</review>

<review id="6710">Completely unreliable product and HORRIBLE customer service is what you get when you buy one of these overpriced paperweights!  After only a year my PC no longer recognized the drive and since it was no longer under warranty, My Book customer support would not help me one single bit unless I called the tech support line that charges you a fee!  Now all the data I have on it is lost forever and it just sits on a shelf collecting dust...you know...kind of like an actual book.</review>

<review id="6711">This looks  nifty and has lots of blinking lights, but is technically poor and poorer.It basically HIJACKS your 1394 connection and shuts down DNS. Its possible that so many multiple connections, ie wireless devices, other computers, and game systems confused it. Also i started getting strange IPs on my DHCP table, leading me to believe someone was hacking my network wirelessly. A sad trend indeed></review>

<review id="6712">Highly overrated coffee maker. Not sure why the enthusiasm in other on-line reviews. Basic low level frustrations: awkward design, excessive bulk, cold coffee, too many pieces. Then I went on vacation and used a twenty dollar coffee maker. Far superior. Don't pay up for this example of marketing over design.</review>

<review id="6713">I was so excited by the reviews that I read on this product that I ordered two and eagerly awaited their arrival. Once I received my shipment, I immediately followed the instructions and set up everything according to the instructions. The next morning I put the pedometer in my pocket and started my day. I checked it periodically and it was registering more steps than I knew I had taken. The ultimate straw was when I logged several hundred steps while driving a short distance in my car. I promptly requested a return label and sent them both back. Fortunately, I only opened one, so I will get full credit for one, but who knows what I'll get back on the second one since the package was opened.  Of course I am also out the shipping costs.  I expected more.</review>

<review id="6714">It started leaking out the top almost immediately.   No way to solve water getting all over the floor.  They need to recall this item and give everyone their money back.  The water hits the filter and splashes out the back.  It needs a water tight rubber gasket and some way to clamp down the top for it to ever work.</review>

<review id="6715">Received this unit yesterday. Tonight I grabbed my scissors and cut the box into pieces to fit into my trash can. Flimsy is an understatement. Fecal deposits on the side and bottom stuck like epoxy. I immediately worried fecal diseases might arise. If I had seen this in a store, I would never have bought it. I'm not filing for a refund, just chalk it up to lessons re-learned; including 'if it sounds too good to be true' and 'you get what you pay for.' Ugh.</review>

<review id="6716">With the decision to marry finally settled, Bella and Edward can plan their lives together.  Things do not go as planned, however, as Bella gets pregnant during her honeymoon and bizarreness (even for vampires!) ensues.***Spoilers abound***Review: For about the first half of this book, I was completely confused about why all the Breaking Dawn haters were giving this latest book from Meyer such a hard time.  Okay, I was a bit bummed that Edward and Bella got married so fast - I was totally on board with the vision of them going to college together and all that good stuff.  And I was even a little bitter that Bella got pregnant right away.  It through me to have a portion of the book written from Jacob's point of view, but I eventually grew okay with that as well.  I was still on board.  However, all of my general good feelings plummeted around page 375 when Bella is changed into a vampire and everything went down hill on a burning sleigh of doom.  It seemed to me that it was similar to in some sit-coms - there's all this romantic tension between two actors, when they get together, the tension is gone, and you realize it was much better when there was all that tension.  Pfft.  When there was all the tension between Edward and Bella because of her humanness I liked the two of them much better than I did once that tension was lifted.  And don't even get me started on the bizarrely named half vampire baby.  Sorry Mrs. Meyer, I just couldn't stay on board with this one.</review>

<review id="6717">THE SHACK is a fictional account of a grieving father who meets the Godhead in an old cabin where his abducted daughter's bloody dress was once found. These god-figures give the father a long series of lectures about the nature of themselves, reality, and how to be free of his grief.Although LIFEWAY Bookstores are selling this book, the purchaser should understand that it isn't a Christian novel when judged by classical Christian doctrines. It presents itself as a Christian book. God the Father is depicted as a female deity; it teaches that people are not sinners, but simply misguided due to wrong intellectual paradigms through which they look at life; the woman-god in the story says she is "extremely fond" of everyone, including the unknown person who murdered the poor little girl; the gods hold no moral expectations of humanity, so they are never disappointed in anyone; the gods criticize the father for being angry at the man who murdered his little girl; there is no holiness or hell; the Ten Commandments are bad; followers of the Lord are free from any obligation to follow moral commandments; and Jesus isn't a Savior, but is a participant in the process of becoming godlike. These points of mystical philosophy -- in prior decades, we would have called it "New Age" -- is clearly presented throughout the book, in the series of dialogues Mack has with the gods. There is no question that this is a profoundly anti-Christian book. But it draws you in by building a strong sense of empathy between you, the reader, and the grieving father, which is a well-known propaganda technique.If you are interested in reading Universalist Unitarianism philosophy in a fiction novel form, this will do it for you. What I have discovered is that many religious people are projecting what they want to be believe about this book onto it, rather than soberly noting its actual message. This is common with religious fiction. The book denies everything in Christian teaching that is distinctive, disturbing, or upsetting, but uses Christian words and concepts to promote antinomian universalism. Because I accept traditional Nicene and Reformed Christianity, I despise this book. It is very, very deceptive.</review>

<review id="6718">I am not happy with this Flip Video.  I seems to work properly when videotaping but will not install the program for it when I connect it to my computer.  Therefore, I am unable to downloadload the videos to my computer.Also, my computer would not accomodate it without an extension cable.</review>

<review id="6720">Until today, my WRT54G has performed well, although I do recall initial configuration woes. Anyway, 6 months after the warranty .... pau. I go to use it after it had the night off and nothing. I couldn't understand a lick of the so-called English the guy in India tried so hard to speak and his bottom line was that it was a very old model (3.5 years) and he couldn't help me without my paying $29.95 to extend the warranty. Right. Linksys has lost me. I find it highly suspicious that it would just decide to die in its sleep.</review>

<review id="6721">I purchased this to replace a 3.5 year old Norelco T990 when its batteries died. I *loved* the T990 and would buy it again, but it's no longer available. (The current T765 is a similar design to the T990.) T980 issues: The electronic power and turbo switches are touch sensitive and too easy to press while trimming. The settings window is tiny and it's hard to read the number. The mini trimmer is an inconvenient attachment. When using the trimmer without the comb/guide, like for neck cleanup, the vacuum tube blocks your view of the cutter. These were enough to make me return the trimmer to Norelco with their 60-day return policy. There was also an issue that may be a defect in the trimmer I received. It would not hold the selected setting. While using it, it would change to a shorter setting! Yikes! I ended-up replacing the batteries in my beloved T990 for about the same price as the T765. Unless you must have the vacuum and one-hour charge time, buy the less expensive T765. Philips Norelco T765 AccuTrim Beard and Moustache Trimmer</review>

<review id="6722">I was intrigued by the prospects of Alli.  Isn't it wonderful?  Just take a pill and you will lose weight and look great!  It sounds too good to be true and unfortunately upon further research, I discovered that it is.  First of all, people lose very little weight.  I found out that Alli is not a new product at all.  It has been around for long time and sold by prescription.  Then Roche sold the pattern to GlaxoSmithKline.  Glaxo repackaged it, gave it a new name and started selling it as the new wonder drug Alli.  This raised my first red flag.  If the drug really worked, why would Roche sell the golden hen to Glaxo?  I quickly found the answers right in the company brochure.  It only blocks 25% of the fats! You can achieve this only by skipping snacks or avoiding sodas!  To mask the impotency of the drug Glaxo instructs to have a healthy diet and exercise.  If the drug doesn't work, you do not follow the instructions!  If it works, most of the benefit may be coming from your new diet and exercise any way.   Very clever!   Second of all, I am really concerned about the health risks associated with the drug.  In addition to the inconvenient and embarrassing well-documented side effects, I am worried that there are other long-term, more damaging risks which will start to emerge.  I know that the drug was FDA approved but so was Vioxx, Ephedra and other drugs dangerous drugs.  After all, this is unnatural, chemical way to lose weight.  I will not be surprised if the concerns that it may cause cancer or other serious illnesses may turn to be true.  I refuse to be the testing mice!  I would rather go with a safer, common sense diet plan like Weight Watchers or Nutrisystem. In summary, I found that Alli is a marketing product which plays perfectly to fast gain, no pain customers.  However, after I took a careful second look I saw a lot of pain and no gain.</review>

<review id="6723">We bought this machine because of it's size -- it would fit in our appliance garage.  However, in order for it to be narrow, the loaf pan is elongated, and hence there are two paddles instead of one.  This results in poor kneading, because the dough gets repeatedly torn, tearing up the gluten strands as they're forming (at least this is my conjecture).  It works OK if you make a large amount of dough, but you can't make a small loaf or a smallish amount of pizza dough.  I have not tried baking in the machine, but I doubt this would work well either, because when I lift the lid to get the dough after the first rise, it's usually lopsided.    It's very expensive too!  The one I had before that was only about $50 and did a fine job.  That one, however, started "schooching" on the counter while kneading and finally smashed to the floor.  I have not had good luck with bread machines.  A caveat: I bake all the bread for the family, so it gets used 3-4 times a week.</review>

<review id="6724">This product arrived in a very timely manner, and Amazon handled my refund promptly and without an issue.  And that is all I can say that is positive.  After reading many reviews, I decided to give this flat iron a shot.  I have been using a much cheaper Conair that was just worn out after a 1 1/2 years of use.  I honestly cannot say anything about the product itself because I never got the chance to try it.  When the flat iron arrived, the shipping box was fine.  However, I discovered the actual box to the flat iron was not sealed and looked to have been previously opened/returned.  There was no owner's manual, just a flyer warning against electric shock.  The plug had a rattling noise and after trying in EVERY outlet in my house, the flat iron would not turn on or heat up.  I returned the product for a refund instead of an exchange and have since asked for a Babyliss Nano Titanium (what my hairdresser uses on my hair) as a Christmas gift.</review>

<review id="6726">What a disppointment.  I received this 4th Generation iPod as a Christmas gift.  I was really looking forward to getting it as my previous iPod nano was full and I needed one with more room.  It works great and looks great(the new bigger screen is very nice), but Apple changed the charging plugin so that these new ones are not charged on my iHome or any of the other accesories that we have.  This becomes a big pain, especially when traveling.  I used to be able to charge my ipod while I was driving and listening, now the iPods must be plugged into the computer or into an outlet using an adapter to be charged.  It is very inconveniant.</review>

<review id="6727">I am a bonafied fan of the original Battlestar Galactica.  I cheered ABC television and Universal Studios when they decided to place BsG on at Sunday evening, a mere nine months later I also booed and hissed at them when they cancelled the show.  I was only twelve years old but I knew they had a certified hit worthy of a few seasons not a mere 12 episodes.  All of my friends agreed with me as we were drawing copies of a true Colonial Vyper.   This "ReImagined" version is a far far wisper or is it a wimper as in wimpering canine, unlike a daggit which was a cute addition. This Remagined version doesn't even have lasers, it has ordinary guns.  THe gender changes don't play well with my sensibilities.  No I'm not a Male Chauvinist by any measure, but be serious Dirk Benedict was made for the role as a cigar chompping, womanizer. I doubt the woman playing his (Errrr) part could hardly stand when he was in that role.  The next problem Cylons weren't invented by mankind, they were a completely distinct race of creatures who were massacred by the cyborgs that replaced them.  Finally the role of Colonel Tigh is a joke for too many reasons to mention. Trust me Go ahead and pay the $80.00 for the original and see the diference for yourselves.</review>

<review id="6728">My flash drive stopped working after I plugged it on a Windows Vista machine. After that, I couldn't even format it.

<review id="6729">This product was only acurate the first 4 times I wore it.  On the fifth try it was consistantly wrong during my entire hour of exercising.  I tried it several more times to see if it would start working again but it never did.  I'm going back to taking my own heart rate by hand.</review>

<review id="6730">I like the feel of this keyboard even though the tilt needs to be higher.  Trouble is, the backlighting shines up through the keys in such a way that it's very hard to see, especially at the lower angle.  I'm sure this would be fine if you were a touch typist but since I'm not it's a waste of money for me.  If you just want it to look cool, this might be for you.  If you really need to see the keys in low light, look elsewhere.</review>

<review id="6731">This router had been working for me for 6 months with no problems, but now the router will crash and require me to pull the power and plug it back in to reset. This happens at least 5 times a day. As you can see my experience is not unique. There are major flaws with this product and contrary to the advice of Netgear a firmware upgrade will not help.</review>

<review id="6732">This item seemed like a bargain but it was a big mistake! Using it totally turned our new iPod Shuffle to waste. Sorry we ever considered it! How they could make something so simple to be so bad that is destroys your electronics is hard to understand... but unfortunately true.</review>

<review id="6733">The show is outstanding, but it's a tremendous shame that the box set only contains the first 10 episodes Season 2 and still costs $35.For the price and lack of content, the 2.0 box set deserves a 1 star rating. But the high quality of the DVD transfer means it has at least one redeeming value. Hopefully they won't do this again.</review>

<review id="6734">This camera was just too small for me to handle properly especially the zoom. Also was very difficult to transfer movies to computer.</review>

<review id="6735">After the purchase of two of these I feel confident to say that the quality of Kitchen Aid products is EXTREMELY low.  In both cases, the part that holds the attachments and attaches to the gears does NOT stay connected to the unit and falls off while mixing.  The design is very poor and after seeing it, I understand why it fails so badly.  I have repeatedly tried to fix the machine, called Kitchen Aid, but no solution seems evident. Heed my advice, DON'T BUY A KITCHEN AID PROFESSIONAL 600 SERIES!</review>

<review id="6736">This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      If you believe this is a kid's movie, then it clearly was made by people who don't have kids, and marketed by people who don't have kids. If you believe it's an adult sci fi movie (as I do) well, it's truly hard to imagine something harder to sit through. I couldn't help but howl, "Make it stop," and I wept tears of joy when it mercifully ended. Less fun than a sack full of kittens and a brick.</review>

<review id="6737">We loved the unit up until recently.  Just in the last month or so (after owning it for one year) the coffee has been extremely weak, almost to the point of not bothering to use the unit.  We've called Keurig and they told us to clean it.  We did, but still weak coffee.  They've yet to get back to us.  We loved it up until recently, but are about to switch to something else.  When the unit worked well, the coffee was a bit on the weak side, but good.  Lately, however, it's been way too weak for us.</review>

<review id="6738">Ok I took note of the reviews and some issues folks had with this model and I still purchased it.  What is worse is even though I found that I disliked the same things as others I kept it, and only after the 60 day return did I decide I didn't really like it enough to use it.  So I am at fault, but I don't want others to make the same mistake.  The length setting is easily shifted while in use.  There is a plastic part near the blades which moves up and down when pressed against your face, why not just have it stationary?  I removed the plastic piece and then when I went without it I got the 5 o'clock look when I set it on a 3 which is odd.  The vacuum does work well (when in turbo mode) but I really didn't need it.  I donated it to the veterans, and I hope they get some use out of it.  I then went to target and for 25 dollars (10 less) I purchased the remington mb-300, which is much like the old norelco I had but better in several ways.  If anyone is thinking of purchasing the t-980 please reconsider and get the remington mb-300.</review>

<review id="6739">The Netgear wireless router product is apparently in working order because I mailed it to my son in Tennessee who got it to work just fine on his equipment which is the same as mine. Surely, I'm not so technically savvy as my son, but I can read and write and follow directions. The setting up of the equipment is quite complicated, in my view, far moreso than it should be. I've set up other peripherals with success, but this product is more than I can handle. I've followed the directions, over and over, and still the router doesn't connect. I've given up. Can't handle the frustration. By the way, I'm way over the age of 13. I have grandchildren over the age of 13.</review>

<review id="6740">Yesterday, December 27, I spent at least 3 hours trying to sort out the mess called the Flip Video "Ultra" 60 minute camera.  It involved at least 3 calls to tech support lasting a total of about 2 hours.  Knowledge level was fair to poor.My problem started with downloading the software update that constantly pestered me on the screen.  it took a long time to do this and it wiped out the entire contents of my camcorder and placed them in a back-up folder!  later I was told by tech support that it wasn't really necessary to download the software update.  I ended up taking the battereis out of my camcorder twice, renaming each of the 14 videos once, switching the unit on and off 8 times-three times, reloading everything at leasttwice, etc.Still the problem persists:  39 minutes of recording left, with no recordings on the camcorder.  I was told by 2 different representatives that I would get an E-mail within 4 hours and also a telephone call. None of that happened.I figured that I screwed away a lot of time with your riece of junk!</review>

<review id="6742">Why I bought this jucier because I saw so many good reviews about it. Then I placed an order on January 5th 2008, it arrived on about 14th Jan.I was so happy when I first try it, it work very good. but after 1 month, one side of the handle broke.

<review id="6743">I will start with I AM a BIG fan of the original 1970s series.There was almost no continuity with the original.  Turning Starbuck and Boomer in to Women!!!! What the Hell.  If you wanted to use Female lead roles fine...but at least give them different names.The stories are nothing but lame drama very little action and almost no space action.  The stores more resemble a soap opera than a sci fi show.  It was like watching "As Galactica Turns".  And once they had one of the actors fall in love with a cylon I quit watching.The sets are lame, very low budget.  The cyclons do not even look like some alien race no kind of armor, fine they did not have to make them look shiny...but making them look like humans ... Huh!  Bad guys should look like bad guys not some mentaly twisted version of humans.I can't believe Glen Larson could do something like this.  If they were going to change this so much from the original they should of called it something else.</review>

<review id="6744">I purchased this as a gift for a business associate and I had planned to buy a pile more to create some low budget video fun. Sadly, the Vado was better in theory than in reality. The video was super fuzzy and seemed out of focus. My associate and I played with it for a couple days trying to get the video to be in focus but we never got it to look right. I bought a Flip and it worked great. Sadly the Flip used AA batteries and was more expensive but at least the video was in focus.....</review>

<review id="6745">Customer support was completely and utterly incompetant.   I had this router in California and moved to Washington where it didn't work.  I spent 3 hours with customer support.  4 disconnected calls later and 1 unreturned call later I gave up and had to purchase a new wireless router.  I will never again choose Linksys.</review>

<review id="6746">I am a big George Foreman grill fan; I've used them for years.  I currently have two Foreman grills, one of the small 1-burger models and one of the larger family-sized models.  I love them both, aside from how big of a pain they are to clean.  I've had them for years and use them multiple times a week to grill sandwiches, burgers, chicken, and all kinds of yummy things.  Anyway, I ordered the G5 "Next Grilleration" because I was excited by both the multiple cooking plates and the ability to remove the plates for easy cleaning in the dishwasher.  And the red color was really, really cool.The G5 Grill fell short of my expectations.  Let's start out with the grill plates.  There are 5 plates, but 2 of them are grill plates, 2 of them are waffle plates, and 1 of them is a baking plate.  I was under the impression that I would get 2 grill plates plus the fancy grill plate, then a griddle plus a baking plate.  Not so.  Anyway, now the burgers don't have the traditional straight-line grilled look because the top plate has a different shape.  Not a big deal, but it also seems to "steam" the burger more than grill it.  Burgers come out much different than on my other two George Foreman grills.  They aren't as much fun to eat because they don't have that "grilled" texture to them as much as the older Foreman grills do.  Next, the griddle-baking pan.  Nice concept, but the adjustable heat knob doesn't really match up to a traditional stovetop.  "High" is more like "Medium".  Which brings up another point, the pictures make the grill look a lot bigger than it is.  This is a 1 or 2-person grill.  You can do 2 nicely-sized burgers at a time on it.  Anyway, I tried the waffle iron multiple times.  It does NOT heat evenly.  I even gave it a few extra minutes to heat up after the preheat light had gone off.  It cooks the middle nicely, but leaves about an inch and a half around all of the edges mushy.  It's a pity, since the waffle plates are nice and big.  I was really disappointed by this; I was hoping to be able to consolidate my kitchen gadgets into one little unit, but the waffle iron just doesn't perform very well.There is an extra plate set available for this grill which I also purchased, which is the omelet maker.  It's not a true omelet maker since you just kind of throw the toppings on top of the egg mixture and cook, but it is the ONLY plate that I felt did a good job cooking.  The wannabe-omelets actually came out very nicely.  So, to recap: the omelet plate is great, the burger plate steams rather than grills and the top isn't shaped like a normal grill, the waffle iron doesn't heat evenly at all, and the baking pan is kind of small and doesn't heat up as well as you think it would.  I also considered trying out the larger model (which only had grill plates), but after looking at it in a local store and seeing that it had the same heating system, I decided not to.However they did a lot of things right, despite not being able to cook very well.  The color option was really nice.  There is a big, long handle on the front which is AWESOME for lifting the top tray up.  The heat setting dial, despite the temperature problem, is a nice touch.  And the removable plates are to die for.  I miss the light going off on the front when you're burger is done, but it would be a small price to pay if the adjustable heat setting actually worked as well as an electric range.  I really, really wanted to love this appliance; it did everything right but cooking.  Oh, and the non-stick surface seemed to scratch easily, and I only used rubber and plastic tools on it.  Not as durable as my old ones, which I've had for years.Conclusion?  It's okay, not great.  I would recommend waiting for the "G6 Grill" or whatever will be next; hopefully their technology will have improved.  I'm sticking with my old fixed-plate grills for now.  Sorry George!</review>

<review id="6747">I purchased the Panasonic bread machine based on the good reviews that I read here.  I have owned 2 Breadman machines in the past and was happy with them until they wore out.  I expected this machine to produce the same quality bread and was very disappointed.  The loaves from my favorite recipes came out small and hard and did not taste the same.  The crust was very tough. The recipes in the book were MUCH too salty and we tried several loaves before giving up and sending it back.  I've noticed from the other reviews that the people who had owned bread machines from the past (when they actually made machines that were good quality and made good bread) are all disappointed with the new machines.  I agree.  Why did so many companies make changes to good products and turn them into bad ones?</review>

<review id="6748">I can't believe all the good reviews on this machine.  I bought one at the Target sight, and was so glad I could take it back.  It was so slow pouring from the thermal pot, and the last cups could not be poured unless you took off the lid and completely tipped it over.  Also I tried different kinds of coffee, all with the same results--bad.  To get a decent cup it took double the grounds of my old coffee maker.  Way over priced.</review>

<review id="6749">This year's version has major bugs.When entering capital gains (Schedule D) and charitable deductions (Schedule A) using Easy Step, entries would not appear in the proper forms and the forms would not calculate.  By accident, I discovered that I could "solve" the problem temporarily by quitting and restarting the program.  When it did calculate new entries, it was very slow.For some unexplained reason having to do with Schedule H, I couldn't file electronically.  So I clicked the "Print Returns to Mail" button.

<review id="6752">I found this program more difficult to load and more cumbersome to use than previous editions. It was so restrictive and  time consuming I sent it back and decided to reinstall the older edition I had purchased years ago. As seems to be more common, the upgraded editions are more difficult to use and in reality do nothing more than the older editions.</review>

<review id="6753">My number one pet peeve with coffee makers is overflow from malfunctioning drip baskets when the coffee pot does not get seated well into the burner area.  I was ready for this when I purchased this moderately priced coffee maker and was pleasantly surprised when this didn't seem to be a problem after several days.  Then it happened...and it turned out not to be the coffee pot problem at all...it is the filter basket on this little gem that gets out of whack.  If it gets bumped *just a smidge* it will fail to seat itself down into the well and release the drip valve and the next thing you know you have coffee all over your counter.  First time it happened I thought it must have been a fluke, but no...it's happened three times now and this pot is going into the trash.  The last thing I need to be doing is spending my morning mopping up coffee and grounds "before" I've had that first dose of caffiene.</review>

<review id="6754">I think the fact that Intuit is charging per return is unconscionable!  I only file a single return so no skin off my nose.  But I have been warning everyone I know, all TurboTax users, all late buyers, and all mutlple return filers, to seek alternatives.  I am an early adopter.  I make it a game to see how quickly I can get my return in.  These people all buy the software later and therefore now have been warned and will be seeking, and I suspect taking advantage of other ways to file their taxes.  Another thing.  I believe in past years I have gotten one State FREE.  I will have to pay for my one state this year.  Next year I am trying something else.  I may even look carefully to see if I can return this software and give TaxCut a try.  I'm pretty outraged.  How to bilk the customer for all they are worth.  I'll use something else next year merely because I do not trust a company that uses bait and switch tactics.  So long Intuit.  It's not bad enough you own the personal finance market and fix the bugs with Quicken.  Now this.</review>

<review id="6755">Recd this AAO 10.1 a few weeks. Also, like another post, I cannot hear/feel the fan running. Some other people said their fan is too loud, etc. So, I don't know what is going on with the fan. I sent many emails to Acer and they were no help and told me to telephone Acer, which I did. Very unfriendly people there, who didn't seem to want to help at all. Several calls, long time on hold, several cut-offs, and finally spoke to someone who said "yes," the fan was working "all the time" even though I couldn't hear it. So, at this moment I don't know what the heck is going on with the fan.Some programs were supposed to be installed on the computer, which were not installed. Aver kept telling to get the programs from the Recovery disks. There were no Recovery disks enclosed? Plus, there is no DVD/CD drive. No way to play DVDs if you do have external drive, because the MS Media Player installed does not play DVD movies. Acer said to load some other programs to play the DVDs.All in all, I would not purchase an Acer product again, especially because of their 'out-sourced' service/tech support. Not worth it!</review>

<review id="6758">Pros: Beautiful looking keyboard with a great feel of the keys. Requires very little pressure. Lighting works fine for me but the WASD mode is useless since no games that I own use only those keys.Cons: Too pricey for what you get. The driver needs major work. The USB port is terrible and the keyboard does not play well with other USB devices plugged into the computer. The shift key works when it wants to and the typematic is intermittent as well. The mic and speaker jacks are incredibly noisy.Save your money until Razer updates the driver. I wish I would have bought a Logitech G10 instead.</review>

<review id="6760">Caution - Spoiler alert! If you have not yet read this book, and do not wish to know the ending, please do not read this post!As many of you know, the final book of Stephenie Meyer's popular vampire series came out this weekend, breaking sales records with 1.3 million copies flying off the shelves in the first day. Thousands of reviews and articles about the book are floating about, and not one of them touches on what I believe to be the most dangerous and overlooked element of the novels: Racism. The new book, "Breaking Dawn," concludes the story of teen protagonist Bella, who in previous books had been shown to be falling in love with a vampire, Edward, who, like his "family" of vampires, has chosen not to prey upon humans out of conscience, going against his nature for the good of his soul. Edward is attracted to Bella because she smells terrific to him, her blood type is tailor-made for him, and yet he is able, by resisting the call to sin through sheer will power, to translate his violent lust into a compassionate and protective love.I have read all the books in the series, and enjoyed them on many levels. I have even stopped to gasp at Meyer's excellent plotting and storytelling, her wonderful use of cliffhangers, and her perfection in word choice. I was inspired by her use of profound moral and ethical dilemmas. While the media claim her books succeed because they are about vampires, I believe a large part of her success is due, rather, to the profound philosophical issues raised in the tale of a moral vampire in love with a human girl.The fundamental message of Meyer's books, I believe, is that of selflessness and moral courage, at least in the first two books. I believe Meyer's strong Mormon faith (she is a practicing Mormon and a graduate of Brigham Young University) influenced her writing in a good way here, in helping her to craft thoughtful storylines that dealt with complex moral/religious issues.That said, there is an underlying racism to the books that deeply disturbs me. I believe this is also the influence of Meyer's faith - a faith I saw in action when I had breakfast with her at the White House as part of the National Book Festival two years ago. (Meyer would not drink coffee, because her religion forbids the use of caffeine, for instance.)Of primary concern for me is the treatment of Meyer's main Native American character, Jacob Black. He is presented initially as a sweet, normal teen boy from the Paiute Reservation, but we soon learn that he is a werewolf, and that werewolves are the enemies of vampires. The vampires, at this point in the story, are shown to be European in origin, and as pale as pale can be - and friends to Bella, our human protagonist.Jacob loves the irresistible Bella, just as Edward does, though he and his kind seem unable to resist their sinister nature the way the white vampires do. In the first two books, Bella is mildly drawn to Jacob (and even kisses him), particularly when Edward seems to lose interest in her. In the final book, Bella must choose between these two boys.Naturally, she chooses the (white) vampire over the (brown) werewolf.On the surface, this might seem insignificant. It might even seem to be enlightened for Meyer to include a Native American boy in her novels in the first place. But you must consider that in the Book of Mormon 2, 5:23, God is said to have placed "the curse of black skin" upon the Lamanites, in orer to make them unattractive to the Nephites. The precise word used is "black," the name Meyer chose to give her dark-skinned Native American character. The Laminites, meanwhile, are described in the Book of Mormon as being a wild, ferocious, plundering, robbing, and murdering people, and God punishes all Nephites who marry them by cursing their children with dark skin, too. Among the leading Laminites mentioned by name in the Book of Mormon is...Jacob.No author with the skill that Stephenie Meyer possesses does anything in her books by accident. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the deeply Mormon Meyer did not accidentally name her sinful, dark-skinned boy Jacob Black. Nor did she accidentally have him turn out to be the less desirable of the two monstrous boys vying for Bella's attentions.I have read much about these books in the media - about how they are the new Harry Potter, about how Meyer is a millionaire many times over because girls and their moms love vampires. Time and again, I have seen mothers quoted in articles about the series, speaking of their love for the books because they are "squeaky clean" - meaning there is no sex in them (or gay people, or minorities other than the Native American werewolves). Just in case you doubt there is a conservative religious message to these books, consider that the hapless human boy who also adores Bella (but doesn't stand a chance, being a total loser) is named Mike...Newton. As in science. One wonders if Mike Darwin would have been too obvious...?Also of significance: In the movie, as with the book, the most evil of the vampires (the ones who are enemies to the white Edward) is dark African Laurent, whose name is an anagram of the worst of the Laminites described in the Book of Mormon, Lautner. Unlike Edward and the white vampires, he is unable to resist hunting and draining humans.Interestingly, in this final book, Bella not only ends up spurning the dark-skinned boy. She also ends up married and pregnant - at 18. Squeaky-clean, eh? God forbid Bella have, say, decided to hold off on boys, monstrous and otherwise, until she got, way, her chemical engineering degree. How fascinating that in the "good, clean" books of Stephenie Meyer, racism, teen pregnancy and teen marriage are celebrated, and not a single mainstream reviewer I have read seems to have taken notice.I held out hope, until this last book, that the gifted Mrs. Meyer might actually do the truly moral thing, and make Native Jacob good, in order to take polite issue with a pathetically misguided Mormon teaching. Sadly, she did not. This is disappointing. And, to my mind, dangerous, given the extreme popularity of the books.As Meyer is compared in every magazine and on every news program to JK Rowling (a writer I believe actually has excellent moral messages, though her books - surprise, surprise - are reviled by the very same parents who adore Meyer), and as we prepare for the first of her vampire novels to &lt;a href="http://www.twilightthemovie.com/">hit the big screen as a movie&lt;/a>, we must ask ourselves whether we as a nation, and as parents, will continue to embrace an author who uses her formidable talent to present thinly-veiled racist teachings taken from her church. Should we be so quick to reward Meyer for her denigration of a significant portion of her audience by continuing to hail these books as mere "squeaky-clean" vampire stories? I believe we should not. They are more than that. They are, like the most effective propaganda, wolves in sheep's clothing. Werewolves, in fact.</review>

<review id="6761">The reviews aren't exaggerating.  I consider myself rather tech savvy and thought that perhaps the bad reviews were from people who didn't really know how to be careful with complicated hardware.  But I was wrong.  This is a beautiful player with a lot going for it, except for the fact that it's extremely buggy.  The first one I received had the "white screen" bug -- it started at white screen right out of the box, nothing I did could make the display change, and Creative was completely unable to fix the error.  I sent it back (to Amazon -- see my postcript below), and received another one.  The second works much better than the first, but goes to white screen when I "lock" and then "unlock" it again.  I have to turn off the player, then restart it to reset the display.Bottom line: I really want to like this player -- enough that I will try it a bit longer and wait for one more firmware update (if it arrives).  But it sounds like many of the problems are hardware rather than firmware.  I fear that it's a lemon, which is disappointing.  Purchase with caution.P.S. Five Stars for Amazon's customer service!!  It's so nice to know that I have protection from getting burned by Creative's manufacturing problems -- something that will keep me coming back to Amazon as a regular electronics customer.***UPDATE*** And it's not good news: 24 hours later, I try it out again, and it won't play music.  It just freezes.  Not good, Creative Labs.  Not good at all.  I will give it 48 hours -- if there is not a firmware upgrade in that time, I'm back to Ipods.  Man, I really want to like this player, too.</review>

<review id="6763">Beware - apparently you can only use your Quicken software for two years, then they discontinue the online download capability of the software...I just found this out today:  I'm using Quicken 2006 and anytime I click on Account Update to download transactions from my banks, I get a window that pops up saying I have until April 30th 2009 to upgrade to Quicken 2009 or else I'll no longer be able to download my transactions using the current 2006 software version.  Now, I started using Quicken 2002 back in the day, and I used to upgrade every year because you could get a "free" version after rebates by purchasing it with Turbotax.  I stopped upgrading because every time there were no new features that made the investment worth it, and new bugs were annoying, so I prefered to keep the version I had rather than debugging yet another version.  Seems to me that this is really just a hidden "subscription" to Quicken that allows you to download your financial transactions.  I mean, without downloading transactions, what's the use of Quicken?I have to start looking at other financial software to replace Quicken, since I don't appreciate getting ripped off - why doesn't Quicken warn users that their programs are only good for two years?  Seems like fraud to me...</review>

<review id="6764">Hooked it up, not a problem.  However, after a couple of weeks, the signal strength gradually went from 70% down to 20% and then it simply died. No link activities at all, some indicator lights did not flash when they should. I thought it was because of power/phone-line surge that damaged it, so I  purchased all kinds of surge protections, and purchased another LinkSys, same model (because it was on sell and had a good rebate), and again, same exact problem after 2 weeks.  I returned it and got a brand new replacement, and again, it happened after 1 week this time.  By chance, I spoke to a friend of mine about it, and guess what, he had the same exact problem and ended up buying a NETGEAR.  I gave up too, and purchased a NETGEAR, and so far after 3 months, no problems and the link quality is still at a constant 97-100%.DON'T PURCAHSE THIS PRODUCT not matter how cheap or how much rebate it comes with.  It is not worth your time.</review>

<review id="6765">I was drawn in by the price, and figured I'd take a chance since the reviews were about 50/50.The product does not work as many other reviewers stated.  My heart rate would read wacky and varied at rest and zero during exercise. And I'm fairly certain that I do have a heartbeat.I thought it was worth the risk given the low cost. Amazon rocks as usual with returns of unworthy products, however just know going in that you'll likely end up sending it back.  In the end, it was just a big waste of my time and effort.Despite the huge cost difference, I'll be moving to the Polar brand (which my boot camp instructor recommends).  Because no matter how cheap you can get something, it's worth nothing if it doesn't work.</review>

<review id="6767">I have purchased several Pedometers in the past even one that was recommended by Consumer Report that counted steps even when I wasn't moving. In addition the clip broke when I tried to put it on my belt.

I wear it at work and when I work out at the gym. Several friends plan to purchase this item because I told them how well it works compared to those they purchased. I highly recommend this pedometer to people who want to count their steps with the 10,000/day goal of good health.</review>

I contacted TurboTax Support  (they were very helpful) and they told me the only way to get it to install was by uninstalling some other software.

<review id="6769">I haven't seen the DVDs but I'm sure they are good.  They always have good bonus footage and commentaries.  I did see every episode on Sci-Fi network and I have to say it was definitely not the best season to say the least.  I did like all the other seasons however.I won't ruin it of course but the ending was a huge let down to say the least.  Up until then it was okay, maybe 3.5 stars but after that dumb ending I can give it no more than two.  In fact after I saw that ending I wondered why I had wasted time watching this series in the first place.  It was both dumb and predictible.  If you are buying this as a gift for a BG fan then I think they will like it because the DVDs are great and include a lot more than just the episodes.  I haven't seen these DVDs but if they are like the others then I think it's a great gift.  Plus if they don't like the ending too then they don't have to feel bad about wasting their money to see it, they would have wasted yours instead lol.</review>

<review id="6772">The Good; Nice performances abound.The Bad; Did the entire Revolution take place in John Adams' front yard? He hustles the kids in the house during the battles of Lexington and Concord, which took place about 25 miles away? Henry Knox just swings by with the canons from Fort Ticonderoga?And speaking of Henry Knox, he was 26 at the time of the Revolution, the actor playing him is 45. Could be worse though, Thomas Jefferson is played by a 52 year old actor. Jefferson was 33 in 1776. Oops.The God Awful; There is no excuse for the camera work in this film. Early in the second episode there is a shot of a house that is so insanely tilted that I actually laughed out loud. Then they cut to a dinner scene inside and jumped from one angle to another until I thought I was watching people dinning on a ship at sea. When the executives previewed this farce did it not occur to them to question shots that made it look like John and Abigail were about to slide off the bed?  Poor John Adams, will he never catch a break?Update; This just goes from bad to worse. The happiest times in the Adams' lives were the days that John, Abigail, John Quincy and Nabby spent in Europe during Adams' SECOND diplomatic mission. After a joyous reunion in London they all went to Paris. There they learned to enjoy what the city had to offer while Thomas Jefferson helped Adams tutor young John Quincy. Instead of the joyous reunion in London we have an awkward meeting in Paris in which John and Abigail are so intimidating by the servents that they dare not even smile at one another. That is SOOO not John and Abigail!  I could understand it if a film maker decided to omit this chapter of their lives in favor of making time for events of more historic import. But why, why on earth, would you replace these true events with scenes that depict the family as deeply unhappy and make John Adams out to be an uncaring father?! Why put John and Abigail in Paris without the two children that accompanied them?   This doesn't even make sense as an effort to increase the drama. If, instead of having Adams snap at Jefferson, "You won't be meeting John Quincy!", the film makers had shown Jefferson and Adams working late into the night as they taught John Quincy geometery (which is what actually happened) then when Jefferson betrayed Adams it would have had the tragic impact that it deserved.  Adams had a temper at times but was, for the most part, an outgoing man with a great self-depricating sense of humor who was also a devoted father. This film not only fails to make that point but seems to go out of its way to portray him as a selfish and angry tyrant. What a pity.</review>

<review id="6774">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)      This was the best movie I saw this year. In fact, I saw it seven times in the theater. As a result of its great success and the huge buzz over Heath Ledger's legendary performance and tragic demise, I figured The special edition DVD would blow my mind-hole. This certainly was not the case. The only decent special features are an interview with Hans Zimmer and others from the production crew about casting the score, and a featurette on the technology Batman utilizes. The other features (the full-framed IMAX scenes, a few mocked-up episodes of "Gotham Tonight", and a picture gallery) could have been left off as far as I'm concerned. No commentaries, no gag reels, no deleted or extended scenes, and not even a word about Ledger. Those are the things that make a SE DVD worth shelling out extra money for. If I had looked up the DVD to check out the special features before pre-ordering it, I'd have gotten the single disc edition.  I suggest you do the same.</review>

<review id="6775">I bought this breadmaker about a year ago. It worked great for a while on both pizza dough and regular breads, and then I couldn't get the pizza dough to work at all. When I told cust. service the heating element wasn't working, they told me the pizza dough setting doesn't use heat. Not believing them, I took it to a authorized repair shop. After waiting almost three months for it to be fixed, they said a control panel had to be replaced.Again, it worked fine at first, and now it doesn't work again. I've swapped out my flour, yeast, everything, and to no avail. I borrowed a bread maker, used the same ingredients in each, and made pizza dough at the same time. The borrowed one worked, the Panasonic did not. I'm now out of luck and will have to buy a new one, but not a Panasonic.

<review id="6779">Great unit until you get to the carafe.  The carafe top is difficult to turn, and you have to turn it if you want coffee.  The carafe doesn't cleanly engage with the filter basket, if you don't precisely place it.  The carafe, when closed will leak if someone tries to pour coffee.  The carafe top requires a separate top to seal the hole so the coffee doesn't cool off. But the seal isn't tight, so coffee can leak out if someone tries to pour it and the carafe top is in the "closed" position.  Overall the carafe system is unnecessarily difficult and awkward to use.  So much so we had to return ours.The rest of the unit is beautifully designed.  Timer.  Controls on the side (where spillage won't seep in).  Water level indicator.  Thermal carafe (so coffee doesn't get ruined by overheating, yet stays warm.  It's as though the designers just didn't complete the job, and the unit was produced prematurely.This should be a 5 star unit.</review>

<review id="6781">Several years ago I purchased the Breville juicer.  I used it 2 or 3 times when it suddenly stopped working.  I returned it and the company sent me a new one.  Although I have only used it a handful of times since then, I have enjoyed the product.  Unfortunately I just used it and again it stopped working.  Needless to say I am very disappointed.  The fact that the same problem occurred with 2 different juicers does not bode well for how the motor is manufactured.

<review id="6784">This product DOES NOT WORK IN WINDOWS VISTA! There are several solutions to all the possible "errors" that occur in Vista but none of these solutions have worked for me, and many others in the discussion of this project below have gone to far greater lengths than I have to fix the errors they keep getting, with no successful results and a lot of stress added to the situation. Do not buy this product, or if you're determined to, really read the reviews to see if you qualify as a "victim of 2008" before purchasing this product. Here's the problem: TurboTax isn't updated so it wants to update automatically at installation. It's impossible to retrieve updates because Vista does not allow them through, therefore it's impossible to file and get the "up to date" forms that we supposedly need in order to file. Don't bother thinking you can get around the "efile" and simply print the forms. They just print out with the words "DO NOT FILE" written in bold letters all over the paper.  This product is a real piece of work, it's just too bad it has people hooked every tax season thinking this is the be-all-end-all way to do taxes. It would be awesome if it didn't suck so much!

In order to boost his male ego and to  make him feel like a man. Even though I can do these things for myself. I said to myself if this is What I have to do in order to have a man in my life. Then I choose not to be apart of his plan. You see, the way I see it, is if you as man are comfotable in your own skin. I wouldn't have to say such things.Now, I appreciate the chapter on setting standards for yourself. Because I myself are tried of seeing and hearing women accept less then, What they are worth in order to say they have a man or because they don't want to be alone. As an independent woman I resent the fact that I have to change my independent ways in order for me to be apart of your plan. Now I realize that me being a strong independent woman may be a problem for some of you gentlemen and that's ok with me. Because that says to me that I'am not the type of  woman you need to be with.</review>

<review id="6788">I had heard of rave reviews of this movie from family members and from reading reviews in the media.  I recently purchased and watched the movie based on what I had heard and read.  I am amazed that anyone would suggest that this movie is a "good" movie or helpful in any sense of developing a healthy relationship.  Aside from the therapeutic aspect of this film, the acting quality and cinematography was incredibly poor. The story line was banal.  The characters were flat.  The lines were all over-scripted to the point that anyone with moderate intelligence would have known what the characters were going to say before they said it.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  Perhaps it would be useful at a pre-teen youth night at night or after-school special or something of that caliber.  This should not have made main-stream big screen.  Anyone seriously looking for help with their marriage need not watch movies anyway as a way to seek help.  Go see a professional counselor/therapist and actually get intelligent information.</review>

<review id="6790">From all the positive reviews here, I had high hopes that this razor would be my salvation from the hell that is shaving.Sadly, after two uses, it's as disappointing as all electric shavers have always been on my beard.It missed everything; I had to go over each area multiple times to get any palpable reduction in beard growth; it took 3 times longer than a blade would have, and when all was said and done, my face still is not entirely smooth.Now, I realize that it takes a few weeks for ones face to get used to a new electric razor, but if the reviews here are to be trusted, I was meant to be blown away on the first use.  To say I was underwhelmed is putting it mildly.I will give it 3 weeks to see if my experience changes, and if it does, I will certainly update this review, but as of right now, I am soooooo saddened by the failure of this product to live up to its promise.Granted I have the most awful beard from hell, but others here who gave this product a glowing review also claimed to have a permanent shadow before the Pulsonic came into their lives, so I was optimistic in my case as well.I hate, hate HATE shaving, and using a blade is torture (I can't even handle the chore every day -- I have to skip a day inbetween); however, blades work.  Electrics, sadly, don't.I feel duped!The design and engineering on this system are amazing, hence the "two stars", but given that it is giving me such a poor shave, that's actually too generous.  Sigh...</review>

<review id="6792">While I enjoy the series very much, I doubt I'll purchase another product from SciFi Channel... I'm tired of paying twice for the same material, and this has happened more than once with BSG.  In one case, the same episode is repeated (with minor additions via editing) on two back-to-back DVDs, and now I find RAZOR is part of Season 4.0...  This is about as dishonest as it gets!  Too bad you can't return a purchase once you discover SciFi channel includes it in the series after they have previously sold it separately!!And don't even get me started on Season 4.0 versus 4.5...  Imagine paying something like $100 for ONE complete season (4.0 and 4.5 being ONE complete season) when other series are approximately half that price.  AND part of the ~$100 season is content that has been previously released!  They pulled the same "fast one" with Season 2.0 and 2.5, but not with Season 3.  Seems they intentionally want keep customers guessing...Best thing to do is delay your purchase and wait to see how SciFi Channel packages the same material over and over again, then make a purchase when you've figured out how to avoid (minimize) this.  You will undoubtedly save a fair bit of money if you wait and see...  Better yet - borrow the series from a friend...</review>

<review id="6793">This waffle maker works great initially and makes wonderful waffles, but like a different user has mentioned, its performance starts to decline after around 5 uses. The waffles started to stick to the lower grid and pull apart when I try to dislodge them from the grid. I've tried oiling as well and that helps some but the waffles still pull apart a bit or flake when I try to get them out.Addition: I'm changing this from a 2 star to a 1 star because the waffler broke this morning after approximately 3 weeks of use.  It won't even turn on!  Thank God Amazon is letting me return it!  I'm going to get a Villaware 3000 Perfect Waffler instead and hopefully I'll have much better luck with it!</review>

<review id="6796">Microsoft's arrogance is breathtaking. People have spent years building skills in Office, and they come along and completely re-make the product. Make no mistake: the 2007 Office is not an upgrade; it is essentially a brand new software package. You have to learn a new program from scratch! Before you rush to call me lazy, think about what you'd do if the car manufacturers made a new car that was so different that you had to learn driving anew. Should they call you lazy if you balk? But wait. Don't they know better than you do as to what you want in a good software? Arrogance. It has undone empires in the past; and it looks like it is going to do the same for Microsoft. Again, the arrogance of putting so much burden on people to re-learn a complex software that they have spent years mastering, of causing so much damage to corporate productivity in the short term (and perhaps even in the long-term), of imposing their view of what is a good sofware so domineeringly upon everyone ... Arrogance, arrogance, and arrogance. Hitherto a fan of Microsoft, I am going to count down the days until the world wakes up to the evils of their monopolization of the office productivity products. The Office 2007 is an unmistakeable evidence of their abuse of this monopoly.</review>

<review id="6797">I had done extensive research/comparisons between this HP 2133, the Asus EEE and higher end ultra mobile portables such as the Dell Laititude 430, or stripped down Thinkpad X61.  I was fully aware of the trade offs that would be associated in using a lower cost HP 2133 or Asus EEE.   I wanted something that could give me basic functions such as web browsing and the ability to work on office docs in places such as class or when I travel.  I took into consideration battery life, screen size and most important price.  I arrived at the HP 2133 thinking it would be a decent compromise of what I wanted.  It's an ultra portable but would still offer features such as a bigger screen/keyboard and 120 gig HD over the Asus EEE but wont cost $1200 or more like a Thinkpad X61 type notebook.Sadly within the first few minutes of using the HP 2133 I could tell I had made a mistake.  In the professional reviews when they say this computer is slow that might just be an understatement.  This computer also heats up very fast, battery life is not impressive and you will need to purchase a license for Office 2007 if you wish to use the program past 60 days.  When you add all these factors up plus the extra price of office your getting a poor performing laptop pushing $1000 or more.  Finding a cooling pad to fit the footprint of this laptop is also impossible.  I am going to return mine as the performance of this computer is like pulling teeth.  Pros-Solid and sturdy feelScreen is great Keyboard compared to Asus EEECons-SLOWCostlyRuns very warm3 pounds vs. @ pounds for the Asus EEEBottom Line- If your looking to make a purchase between the HP 2133 and the Asus EEE I would choose the Asus $300 surf model.  You can easily double the memory capacity with an SD card and there is pre-installed software that can easily import/export files into Office.  The extra keyboard size and screen size is not worth the extra money I thought it would be.  If your looking for a computer such as a Thinkpad X61 or Dell Latitude 430 and try to get away with using this like I did it's probably a mistake.  I knew it would be slower and I would be sacrificing keyboard/screen size but it's not a sound investment.  I am going to return this an look into replacing it with 12.1 inch notebook.</review>

<review id="6799">What a piece of junk.  My poor daughter was heartbroken on Christmas morning.  The Flip worked for about 2 minutes and then was worthless.  We tried everything to get it going but no good.  At least 1/2 a dozen people also tried to get it going, again with no results.  The gift was from Santa so trying to explain that it needed to be sent back to Amazon was a bit tricky.  I am really disappointed in this product and would recommend all to stay clear.</review>

<review id="6800">At first, this seemed like a great controller. It was easy to set up, and it's ability to run several sets of game profiles simultaneously was impressive. I didn't think I'd experience any of the problems that were always associated with the original Dual Action gamepad from logitech. But after only a few weeks of usage, the buttons became very sensitive, the controller didn't always respond right away, and the left analog stick began acting up, making alot of games unplayable. A nice design, but another failed attempt from Logitech.</review>

<review id="6803">If you just love Richard Gere and Diane Lane, then this is a movie for you. However, if you'd rather watch a movie where there's some real love, relationship development, and chemistry, well pass on this film. This was a drippy, predicatble, overdone story - started with Love Story in 1970. At least Love Story had a gorgeous Ali McGraw and Ryan O'Neil in their 20's. Here we get Gere and Lane in their 50's. Sadly, there are just no tears from this viewer, and he is a sucker for a good love story, at the end. The film crying here was almost humorous. My wife and I watched this film on Valentine's day expecting it to be, well a bit romantic. Both of us agreed, fast forward button after an hour and 20 minutes, with 30 minutes to go. Here is why this movie is a moderate stinker. At 43 minutes into the film, Adrienne leads Paul upstairs to an unlit room. She turns on the lights to reveal a studio full of paintings and shrines to her friend's mother. The second item we see (before anyone would have time to do this) is a close up of that shrine, picture of mother, some objects, and a lit candle!!! A lit candle. Nobody had time to light that candle, but there it was in all it's glory, a fairly freshly lit candle - not an eternal flame candle. I noticed that detail, I was so bored with the film.Now, why not 1 star instead of 2? The production values of this film were really high. There were only a few minor camera movement lapses (early in the film for absolutely no reason, the cameraman uses a handheld camera on a fixed angle view and moves around), focus is generally spot on, and the scenes are all very well lit. Sound was well recorded, dialog was clear. The storm scene, the crazy booming in the house was totally wrong. Out of the blue, the film felt like a slasher horror movie and then is silent with no resolution. The downside to this film, the script, and no chemistry between the two lead characters. Christopher Meloni (Law and Order SVU) is kind of sad in this film. I happen to really like his work. But in this film he plays a lame dad / ex-husband that just plain old says all the wrong things, and looks a bit like a bafoon. Not as bad a film as many others. But there is certainly much better around. Hey, just watch the original sappy film, Love Story, and cut out the middle man.PG-13, but just barely. If a younger viewer has a strong stomach for sappy love stories, then by all means. There's no nudity. There is about a 2 or 3 minute scene in bed, but nothing is really shown. I can't remember any language problems. The DVD has absolutely no bonus features, guess who would really want them?</review>

Nothing wrong with our computer, it seems that this happens with Seagate drives regularly.

<review id="6806">The first one I had was a gift and the carafe leaked from the point where the glass meets with the plastic. The spring in the the sneak-a-cup feature popped out, so I didn't have that after it's fifth use. I kept reading about all the rave reviews here on Amazon, so I contacted B&D for a replacement carafe since it was obviously a flaw in their "perfectly dripless carafe".  Well, to my surprise the carafe isn't covered under the warranty and I would have to send them $19.99 plus shipping and tax for a replacement.  Fine, I ordered one off eBay and guess what!!??  Same problem but this one leaks 4x as much.  This coffee maker and the B&D brand (in terms of their warranty and customer service) are reakky a disappointment.  I won't buy from them again.</review>

<review id="6809">Although the Flip Mino HD camcorder seemed to work fine, the software would not install on my computer, which has a 64-bit operating system.  Flip's online support stated as follows:  "Because the Flip Video Program has been designed to work on the 32-bit systems, we cannot guarantee full functionality if used on a 64-bit system.  At this time, we do not have information regarding the development of an application for the 64-bit systems."  Without functioning software, the Flip Mino HD is useless, and I have returned it.  A product that just came out a couple of months ago should be compatible with a computer that's only about six months old, but the Mino HD is not.  Hopefully I'll have better luck with the Creative Vado HD.</review>

<review id="6810">I was just about ready to pull the trigger to buy the ooma system based on the excellent reviews that I've read from other customers. I've been using Vonage for a few years and was considering replacing with with ooma to save even more money. But, I discovered that one KEY feature that Vonage has is not available with ooma. Vonage lets you establish a backup phone number in case the internet connection and/or power is out of commission to your house. In my case, I established my cell phone number as a backup. So, when my internet connection is down or my power is out, when someone dials my home phone number, the call is transferred transparently to the backup cell phone. With ooma, the user's manual simply states, no internet or no power means no ooma. What happens to any phone calls made to your number? The manual doesn't tell you.Unless you have 100% uptime on your internet connection and you never have phone outages, you may want to think twice about having an ooma system take over as your primary/exclusive home phone number.</review>

<review id="6811">I was about to purchase OneCare to renew my subscription when I found out accidentally that Microsoft would be terminating Live OneCare come June 2009. The news was shocking and it actually made me angry because I have invested a significant amount of time installing it on various computers and learning how to use its functionality. In place of OneCare, Microsoft will be introducing a free antivirus called Morro. When I spoke with the call center people in the Philippines who service the OneCare account, they assured me that I can proceed with the purchase as support will still be offered. Having tried and tested the `support' Microsoft offers for OneCare, I have to say that it really is not a selling point. The announcement to pull out of the antivirus market was made in November 2008 and the forum that Microsoft ran to take care of OneCare issues was taken down in December 2008.It infuriates me that Microsoft did not think it necessary to tell its customers that the software they are relying on will no longer be made available and users whose license runs out after June 2009 will simply be bludgeoned with the news that they can no longer renew. Since Morro is not slated to be released until early 2010, this leaves a lot of people who trusted Microsoft in a limbo.I do not have a problem with OneCare, and would actually have happily used it if Microsoft made it available, but I do have an issue with how Microsoft is treating its paying customers over its decision to withdraw from the antivirus market. We are the people who allowed Microsoft to recover their development costs and we deserve to be treated with more respect!</review>

<review id="6812">I gave this book one star because, for me, only about twenty percent of it was worth reading.  Chapters 7, 11, 13, and 24 were very entertaining.  The scenes depicting the love triangle between Bella, Edward, and Jacob play out like a bad soap opera, painfully ridiculous.  And as I see it Bella has no redeeming qualities- why are these guys wanting her so bad anyway?  She is hugely self-centered, needy, and whiney.  I feel bad for the guy that does end up with her, but this book has ruined the series for me so I won't be there to find out who that poor fellow is.  I think this book does young girls a huge disservice as to what their expectations of a boyfriend/ husband should be; not to mention what is acceptable or desirable behavior from a girl.</review>

<review id="6813">Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)      First, I must say that nothing elicits "Mac-envy" so much as yet another revision to the Windows interface. This go-'round, the fine folk at Redmond have broken out the box of crayons, and writ large with the primaries. It's garish. There are some options for the Office suite by which it may all be toned down a notch, which helps. But one wishes Microsoft could get a designer on staff who has some sense of elegance+function when designing user interfaces.What you need to know about Outlook 2007 is the following:1) It is slower that its predecessor.2) It is MUCH MUCH slower if you aren't running Vista3) While it introduces a handful of minor, but helpful new features such as color categories, it manages to make the Rube-Goldberg apparatus of an interface into an even more confusing mess. Understand - this is not due to the much-maligned new Office 2007 "ribbon" - it is due to a whole host of new peculiar UI elements. Good luck sorting it all out....And perhaps most importantly,4) Pieces of it will become disabled after Windows Update does its thing. For instance, after allowing Windows Update to proceed, my rules disappeared, as did the "Rules and Alerts" item in the Tools menu. This resulted in the complete inability to create rules. Perhaps you don't use rules. I use rules a great deal. This has rendered Outlook 2007 unusable for me. I've put a lot of hours into attempting to sort the problem out - while I've found a number of people who had the same thing happen to them, I've found no solutions. Microsoft's resources are no help at all.BOTTOM LINE: Do NOT install this piece of software. Its improvements are negligible at best, it is slower and more difficult to use, the interface is inelegant and kludgy, and worst of all, parts of it will, in effect, disappear.</review>

<review id="6816">I have had mine for about 4 years.  I do notice that my cats drink more with a fountain versus a bowl of water and that one of the cats likes to look at it.  However, this thing is a royal pain!  I take it apart every 3-4 weeks and clean the extremely tight spots with a children's toothbrush.   There always seems to be brownish crude in it.  Not sure what that is.  I also take the pump apart, per the directions given to me by a customer service rep at Petmate.  I soak the pump assembly in hot water and white vinegar.  Do not use commercial cleaning products because they are toxic to animals.  There is always hair in the pump that causes clogs and contributes to this horrible dry sucking noise.  I get really nervous when I walk in the house after a long day at work and hear the dry sucking noise.  This means that the water in no longer in the tank but rather all over my kitchen floor.  Not sure if it's one of my 2 cats that spills the water or something else.  But it does happen at night when I know that the cats are not smashing into it.  I do know that if for some reason the unit is not entirely making contacts at all of the points, it will leak.  Also, if the filter is not in just so, it will leak.  This means more dry sucking. Dry sucking will burn the motor out and possibly short causing a fire?  I am at the point now of looking for another brand because I am truly afraid of coming home to a fire.  Again, I am a neat freak and clean this thing regularly.  I thought about getting another one, but after reading other reviews, I may try the Drinkwell. Be careful.</review>

<review id="6818">This review is from: Australia (DVD)      Once we get past the lengthy travelogue and setup, the remainder of the movie is a snap to predict.  In fact, it is a wide screen, color version of a 1930s western.A hoity toity English lady (Nicole Kidman) goes to Australia in 1938 to dispose of a cattle station (ranch) that is not profitable.  She meets a scruffy cattle drover (Hugh Jackman) and discovers that her husband has just died at the rundown station. And, oh, there's a cute, ragged, intelligent Aborigine boy who loses his mother.  Soon they all set out with a herd of cattle to sell at the port to save the station from an unscrupulous rival rancher.  I suspect that most anyone can write the rest of what happens.Kidman looks aristocratic, then sweaty.  Jackman looks sweaty, then shaven and presentable.  They recite their lines without much interest, but that's OK, because the lines aren't very interesting.  The only thing worthwhile is the scenery of a barren outback that doesn't look as if it could support one cow, much less a herd.Avoid this one.  See it only if you must.</review>

<review id="6821">This device was pretty good, the kids loved sleeping with it running.  Then I purchased a Gauss meter and discovered a whopping 400.0mG of EMF radiating from it.Considering that most countries recommend nothing higher than 1.0mG, and anything over 10.0mG is considered an extreme cancer risk this is completely unacceptable.The EMF declined rapidly as the range from the device increases, effectively dropping to 0 at 6 feet.  However people that put this on their nightstand should immediately rectify that situation! The fact of the matter is, all electrical devices should always be a minimum of 5 feet away from the body in bedrooms.Even so, I question the engineering of this device if it emits such a drastic level of EMF.</review>

<review id="6823">I lost all my prior (from quicken 2005) data. I -think- it was because i had not closed out the end of each year. When I talked to the bank manager of the it department he said that a LOT of 2005 and earlier people lost data. The good news was that I can get the last few statements with just a few clicks. Just a few years of data gone.Talked with my bank when setting up. They also dislike intuit for what they charge for the privileged to use quickens priority transfer. It started free and when quicken picked up they charged for it. The bank did note that they are hoping that ms money can get their act together. I told them don't hold their breath as ms screws up just as much as quicken. After installing and updating my computer crashed a few times. Once on printing and another time acting like it was windows 95 and ran out of resources. These are the first crashes on my computer in years. Thank you intuit.The software sets up a tab called quicken picks. This wonderful tool puts intuit up in your wazoo so they can take part $$ of your purchases. Now, in addition to buggy software they can take a few percent of each purchase. I bet this helps me get the best deal. Nothing like giving intuit part of every dollar I spend. I spend money on this junk so they can hawk their services in my face. I noted that the program is on release R4 and still have bugs. When I bought it, it was R3. In the past I waited until at least R3 for any intuit software so it would not be as buggy. I miss PhaSar. I really dislike intuit. The company treats their customers like crap.</review>

WELL THEN SOME OF THE SONGS THAT HAD PHOTOS DURING THE DAY ARE NOW GONE OR JUST HALF SHOWS UP! I HAVE RULED OUT THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH MY PHOTOS AS I HAVE LOADED THEM ONTO OTHER SONGS OR ALBUMS AND THEY WILL BE THERE ONE DAY AND NOT THE NEXT - I HAVE EVEN TRIED TO LOAD THE SAME PHOTOS ON 7 OTHER TOUCHES WITH THE SAME RESULTS - MY FRIEND AT WORK HAVE TOUCHES AND HAVE ALL HAD THE SAME THINGS OCCUR WITH THEIR PHOTOS. LIKE I SAID I HAVE INVESTED 8-10 HOURS ON THE PHONE WITH APPLE TECK SUPPORT AND I ASK FOR A SUPERVISOR OR SOMEONE WITH MORE EXPERIENCE AND THEY JUST KEEP ASKING ME TO TRY THE SAME THINGS OR THEY SAY WE WILL CONTACT ENGINEERING AND GET BACK TO ME -- NOTHING HAS HAPPENED AS OF TODAY. THE IPOD TOUCH IS NOT RIGHT YET - STAY AWAY FROM THEM - THEY ARE WORKING ON THEM BUT THEY MAY GO BROKE FIRST AND THEN NO ONE WILL BE THERE AT ALL!</review>

<review id="6825">I'll agree like most people that this is a great product. Well worth the extra money because it's far superior to other flat irons. HOWEVER!!!!!! If it fails to work properly, good luck getting it replaced. Mine worked fine for about 6 months, when one day it wouldn't turn on. That's when I discovered the Reset button didn't work. The product has a one year warranty, but Amazon has only a 30 day warranty. The product manufacturer says return it to the place you bought it for replacement, but Amazon wouldn't accept those terms. I sent emails to the iron manufacturer as well as the manufacturer of the electrical plug (with the malfunctioning Reset button) but never heard anything from either. I'm stuck with a very expensive non-working appliance.</review>

<review id="6826">About a month ago, I bought the Samsung SC-DX103. Unfortunately, it was defective. It froze on me several times the first day I tried it (my daughter's senior prom) and then the battery heated up. Eventually, after several attempts, it just wouldn't work and a black screen would appear on the screen and the viewfinder. Walmart did not have anymore in stock so I contacted Samsung directly regarding an exchange but was told they'd need to repair it under warranty. However, if they were to exchange it, I would have to waive the warranty and would be shipped a refurbished one.I paid for a brand new product and was not about to compromise that by having the defective one repaired and returned to me. I could see the product needing repair if something happened after years of use but not if it was defective in the first place.Needless to say, I do not have memories of the two major events in my daughter's life (senior prom & high school graduation).Many apologies for the long-winded note, but I am furious and I do not recommend this product to anyone.</review>

<review id="6827">Unfortunately, Apple still prevents users of Apple Lossless (AL) files from gaining full use of any iPods but the Shuffle. When moving larger files to a Shuffle there is the option to downconvert them to 128kbps, but this option doesn't exist for Nano's or the Classic. So, this drastically reduces the number of files that can be stored on a Classic for those of us who have our collections in high quality AL. This new product is a major disappointment in that it actually reduces storage capacity and still doesn't allow for downconversion. Out my collection of thousands of CDs, which I keep on a Mac mini connected to my audio system, probably fewer than 300 can be moved to the iPod Classic. After owning 7 iPods, I've held off buying a new one until Apple shows that it hasn't marginalized users who rely on AL files, but now it is clear: the choice of Apple Lossless files is a poor one as Apple does nothing to support their optimal use with iPods. A simple software improvement would solve the problem, but Apple is more interested in adding features which conveniently lead people to the iTunes Store, than in improving the underlying infrastructure of the software.</review>

<review id="6828">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      Being a child of the 80's I watched the Transformers cartoon. I am no expert on the characters or the history of them, but I got the gist of it well enough. I refused to see this in the theatre, because it is a Michael Bay movie and we all know his stuff is never worth the price of a ticket. I like to watch his movies in an environment where I can yell at the screen "you've got to be kidding me" and pause and rewind and just plain roll around on the floor and laugh. Transformers didn't fail in that department, it stunk so wonderfully. I don't even know the plotline, because I really couldn't grasp what the heck was going on. The special effects were pretty "special" and by that I mean they have an Olympics just for them. I know that some of these people can really act, given the right script and director, but you wouldn't ever know watching this. I felt like a lot of it was improved.  I am not sure exactly who this was geared towards, old school 80's adults, 10 year old boys, Teenagers, drunk college kids, Michael Bays relatives, because it was all over the place. We had robots peeing on people, Robots cussing, armed forces on motorcycles, delinquent girls who could fix cars, hackers who live with their grandmothers, jerky government types. Its one of those movies where you are yelling "c'mon that would never happen" and "Are you serious?" about 1000 times. I had a headache from rolling my eyes.  In the end, after all the CGI robot fights, and ridiculous situations, I threw my hands up and just accepted it as it was...another M. Bay millions of dollars joke on you. Ha Ha.</review>

<review id="6830">Tha main problem I have with this device is that I cannot get any speeds faster than 11mb.  This was sold as an 80211G WAP but it can't seem to use anything faster than 80211B.  If I were to buy again I would not have spent the extra money for this device I would have stuck with the 80211b version.  Also if you want a serious firewall you should look at the PIX501 from Cisco.  It's orders of magnitude better than this one.</review>

<review id="6831">Our family is toast-intensive and we have been on a years-long search for the ideal toaster.  This is not it.  We purchased it based on the number of positive reviews here on Amazon and for the price we expected a really good toaster.  What we got was a toaster with the following issues and deficiencies:1.  Even on the darkest setting it doesn't toast bagels and english muffins to our desired degree of doneness - we have to re-drop the toast to complete the toasting.2.  It takes WAY to long to toast anything.3.  The left-hand pair of slots toasts lighter and more slowly than the right-hand pair.  This leads to uneven toasting when all slots are in use.4.  The bagel button on one side has never worked.  We didn't discover it until it was too late to return it for a refund, and a replacement is not worth the hassle due to the fact that we hate this toaster.So our quest for a durable, fast, reliable toaster continues.  I think we're at the point of moving to commercial toasters now, which are much more expensive.</review>

<review id="6832">I've owned a Canon Elura 2 standard digital miniDV tape (has 480P) for 6 years but I thought it might be nice to try out a super-portable Sony Webbie camcorder/camera not only because it's $200 but more importantly, its small size as opposed to the gigantic $600+ HD camcorders out there.PROS:- As a camcorder, it shoots great footage in 720P as opposed to 1080P in both indoors and outdoors and of course it's better than my 6-year-old Canon Elura 2.  Playback, however, is great ONLY when using the Sony Webbie camcorder but when I tranfer the video to my pc, there's soooo much motion jerkiness that you can forget about using the footage for anything like watching or editing (My pc's a 2.5GHZ Pentium 4 with 756 megs of RAM and 160gigs hard drive).- Love the small size.  It's smaller than my Canon Elura 2 camcorder (it's as small as my 7-year old digital camera).- Nice big 2.5 inch LCD screen.- Doesn't come with any memory stick but a 16gig memory stick at $100 will record 8hours of video.  However, the battery only lasts 40 minutes.- Nice built-in light.CONS:- As I've said earlier,  horrrrrible motion jerkiness when I tranfer the video to my pc (My pc's a 2.5GHZ Pentium 4 with 756 megs of RAM and 160gigs 7200RPM hard drive).- Can't replace the battery (my experience with my Canon Elura 2's lithium battery is that it lasts about 2 years) so the Sony Webbie cam will be trashed in 2 years but I can live with that.- Can't replace the battery means I can't take an extra battery along because I don't have the time to wait 90 minutes for it to charge before I take it with me to the field each time.- The autofocus is slow and keeps changing which is annoying but I can live with it.- I have to use 2 hands to operate it whereas I only needed 1 hand with the Canon Elura 2.- Slow computer switching between the menu and shooting.- As a camcorder, it takes several seconds before it starts to record whereas it was immediate with my 6-year-old Canon Elura 2 camcorder.- Only 5x optical zoom but I can live with that (My Canon Elura 2 camcorder has 10x optical but most digital cameras only have 3x zoom).- As a camera, it takes several seconds before a picture is taken so the subjects have moved by then.  Any slight motion also blurs whereas my 7-year-old Panasonic 3 megapixel camera handles it without any problems.SUMMARY: I would only recommend this camcorder if you only playback the videos via the camcorder and can afford a new $200 camcorder every 2 years and don't mind giving yourself a 90 minute lead time to charge the camera before going out to shoot.  Maybe Sony's next camcorder will correct these deficiencies and then I will upgrade to a HD camcorder!  In the meantime, I'll stick with my 6-year-old dependable and extra battery capable Canon Elura 2 miniDV camcorder.</review>

<review id="6833">I was talking to someone about the film RELIGULOUS. They told me it was an interesting film and that the main man behind it, Bill Maher, was objective in his search for the meaning of religion, its main theme. So I was surprised to find they were way off track.The film is about Maher's search for the meaning of religion. But his way of doing so coincides with his style of humor. That is to say anyone who says anything he disagrees with he ridicules, makes fun of or rolls his eyes at. I guess the one good thing is that he does so not only with Christians (which is the better part of the film) but with all religions. In his world everyone who believes in a higher being is an idiot or fanatic.Touted as a documentary I guess it qualifies given the world of documentary film makers these days. Rather than take an item and look at it objectively, it has become the norm to twists all truths and falsehoods to suit your own purpose. Intermingle it with scenes from movies that add a bit of humor to them and voila, you have a documentary. Sure its one sided but hey, in Hollywood who cares about that?Maher begins his quest looking for answers. One would think if you were doing so you would attempt to contact the most learned people around the topic. But instead of someone like Billy Graham he goes to...a truck stop parish that holds services in the back of a converted semi-trailer. What he finds is a bunch of good ole boys who believe in God, people that he knows he can run circles around in a battle of words. Not ideas, but words. The choices Maher makes to represent those that believe are always easy targets to make fun of. He chooses a minister who claims God doesn't believe in gays who were once gay himself. Interspersed with their discussions on whether being gay or not is genetic, he tosses in a scientist who says that it is. One instantaneous clip. Interestingly enough he posts a written crawl earlier stating that almost 95% of scientists are atheist or agnostic. So much for objectivity. Who next to contact to understand the meaning of religion? Why of course, lets head to Florida and a theme park based on the Bible. And who better to discuss the topic with than Jesus himself. Or at least an actor who believes and looks the part. Toss in a group of spectators that are die hard Christians and you have the circus you hoped for.Rather than be accused of taking on just one religion, Maher attempts to go after others as well, including a religion based on smoking marijuana based out of Amsterdam. I can see how that one compares. The two biggest are the Mormon Church and the Muslim faith.For the Mormons, Maher pulls up an old film that teaches the most extreme beliefs he can find. Items like indestructible underwear and such. He includes two converted Mormon's who are willing to sell out their old beliefs as well though no one from the church itself. The Muslims? They get the best treatment of all. Maher offers them more respect than he does any other religion. My guess is fear played a great part in this since to ridicule them often leads to a fatwa that calls for your beheading. Throughout the film Maher is asked the question what if we are right and you are wrong? Rather than answer the question, he rolls his eyes, laughs and talks about the fairy tale known as the Bible. His description not mine. How can you believe in anything when you obviously believe in nothing?An honest documentary would take a look at the beliefs, contact people who were supposed to be the best minds behind those religions and get involved in a true discussion of ideas. RELIGULOUS seems more of a hit piece for non-believers. This movie is more of a ego-stroking piece for Maher than it is a true documentary.Everyone should have the right to believe as they choose. What's sad is when someone who believes in nothing but "rational thought" attempts to preach to the rest that his way is the only way. Kind of funny since he seems to think everyone else is wrong and should stop doing the same exact thing.</review>

<review id="6834">I had heard great things about Mavala STOP from many people and was so excited to try it to get our son to stop sucking his finger.  As incentive, I painted some on one of my fingers and it was indeed VERY NASTY tasting.  He licked his finger once and it was gross but not gross enough.  He sucked it off repeatedly!  We ended up stopping its use since it's so high in chemical content and he was basically ingesting it.  Oh well.</review>

<review id="6835">I am not a happy camper.  I bought a WRT54G because of the Linksys/Cisco name, and because it was the cheapest at the time I needed it.  I was replacing my D-Link DI604 wired router (which has been rock solid).  I connected PCs (XP Pro) to two of the ports, and a third PC (W98SE) using a Linksys Wireless PCI card.  The wireless connection worked okay, but I could never get more than 35% signal (40 feet, 2 walls between).  Everything on the other 2 PCs worked fine, too, EXCEPT FOR OUTLOOK 2003 (which I only run on one of the wired PCs).  I could send and receive small messages, but whenever I tried to send a larger message (300K), Outlook would fail on the send with a timeout.  (Reconnecting my old router would immediately fix the problem)  I checked the knowlege base on their website, and found a very good looking article on how to fix my problem.  But the instructions did not match the software running on my router, referring to tabs that didn't exist, etc.  I emailed customer support back and forth for 2 weeks, and never got anywhere.  Finally, I called them and spent 2 hours on the phone with a guy who sounded like he knew how to read his script.  I did everything he said, including upgrading the firmware, and Outlook still wouldn't send large messages.  He finally said "You should take it back and exchange it for another unit."  I said "I sure will -- but not for another Linksys!"  I exchanged it for a D-Link DI624 Wireless G router and a DWL-G520 PCI card.  It's running great, with no Outlook problems, and better signal strength (45%), and I'm not looking back (except to write this review).  Also, by the time I made the exchange, the new 108MB/sec DI-624 was out, so I doubled my speed.</review>

<review id="6836">I ordered this camcorder based on such positive reviews this product has received in the past on Amazon. After spending $ 595 on this camcorder, I received the camera just on time for a special house event. Unforutnately, the quality was worse than my old JVC camcorder (go figure). The miniDV slot is too bulgy and is very cheap quality plastic. I am certain I can find better quality producing HD camcorders and cheaper than a 600 dollar Canon HD camcorder. Yes, I do have HD TV at home and playing back on the video was nowhere close to how HD video should appear. Greatly disappointed!</review>

<review id="6838">I bought Linksys BEFW11S4 Wireless-B Cable/DSL Router 2 years ago when it was new and expensive. It kept dropping my connection and I had to spend half an hour every time getting it to work. So we decided to use my roommate's Mac Airport instead which worked perfectly. After my roommate moved away  I pulled the Linksys router back out to use. Here is the story of my encounter with the tech support: First time I called, I got a guy with such a thick English accent that I had to ask him to repeat every thing 3 times and I was still not sure if I understood what he was saying. He got angry and hung up on me!!!! The second time I called, I got a woman who had absolutely no clue how to fix the router's problem. She would remain silent and I had to keep asking if she was still there or not. This time I hung up on her! Third time I called, I got a guy who thankfully had a smart head on his shoulders and an understandable accent. He figured out that my router that was marked BEFW11S4  was actually a WRT54G so with his help I installed the new driver on the router. Problem is that I still get marginal signal sitting only 2 feet away from the router and it still drops connection every half hour and I have to spend a lot of time getting it to work. I will never purchase another Linksys product. I am going back to Mac Airport!</review>

<review id="6839">My mother and I bought this coffee maker the same day and we both have the same problem...  The filter basked over flows!!!  The "sneak a cup" no-drip filter basket works TOO WELL!  In fact, it doesn't allow the coffee to flow into the pot and therefore overflows all over the counter!  If you like coffee and grounds all over your counter and in your coffee this is the one for you!  If you fiddle with the drip baskets & coffee pot for an hour or so and make sure it doesn't get bumped AT ALL, you might save yourself a mess (or you might not).  With my mother's machine it happened 100% of the time.  With mine, I fiddled with it long enough and babysat it while it brewed, so it only happened 90% of the time...  But, in the end, I'd recommend STAY AWAY from this coffee maker!!!  Unless you like spending your morning mopping up coffee and grounds before you've had your first cup of coffee.</review>

<review id="6840">I tried to like it. I really did. I tried to enjoy how small it was. I tried to appreciate how light it was. I adored the fact that it had an SD Card slot built right in.      All those things are great, but I had just come off a 6.4year love affair with a 600MHz G3 iBook. That machine was my baby and it died. I'm poor and can't really afford much, so I tried to tell myself that it doesn't matter what tools you use, it's more of what you're using those tools for. Not the case.  The standard OS that the Eee comes with can get annoying fast. The Advanced Desktop is slightly less annoying than the Easy Mode, and Ubunto was more attractive, but more buggy than Xandros.To put it in simple terms. This is not a computer I would recommend to my mother, or anyone else.I'm seriously, and not lying, going to buy a macbook after finishing this review. They're only $1024 right here on Amazon. If you're an artist, buy the correct tools. Follow your heart, not your wallet.What's that? You want some more specifics? The battery in Sleep mode stinks. After Sleeping or rebooting you have to always manually reconnect to the wifi (As in ever single time).

<review id="6841">I recently purchased a Seagate 1TB FreeAgent Desk USB2.0 drive.  It lasted less than 6 weeks.  I'd give this drive a zero if that were a choice! After numerous hours waiting for Seagate Tech support on the telephone, it was finally determined to most likely be the drive interface gone south as the drive powered on and spun normally.  Likely caused by a bad power supply or other power related issues.  (I use an APC Smart-UPS 700 for power protection, so I suspect the cheap little AC/DC converter.)  In any event, Windows XP Pro was unable to recognize it, and Seagate advised me my only recourse was to submit it for replacement under warranty.  If I wanted my data back, that was $200.  If I cracked the external case to access the hard drive to extract my data, the warranty was void.  If I wanted it expedited, that would be $20, thank you.  Otherwise they would wait until receiving my drive, then sending me a refurbished one.  The $20 method ultimately took 5 days and the new drive works fine....for now. It's a great little drive, but I won't trust it with my data any longer.  So what's the use of spinning backup if something as fragile as the interface can fail almost immediately? Seagate's response to my comment that my data was more valuable than their drive ($200 for them to get the data, $128 for a new drive)...you should never trust your data to an external drive without having secondary backup.  I could have bought a mirrored RAID 2TB system for less cost than the drive and their data recovery option (I paid a higher price in December than currently advertised).  Live and learn.  I strongly recommend that before buying one of these inexpensive large capacity external drives, a person consider a swappable RAID 1 system or at a minimum, buy your own case and get a drive you have access to if something as simple as the interface goes bad.</review>

<review id="6843">UPDATE- I emailed amazon to let them know about this router since their supplier may be giving them second run products and they have offered to allow a return of this and refund my money. So Amazon does stand behind their products!I bought this router and for unforseen reasons I was unable to install it until this past week, the dumb thing is defaulted to spanish and will not revert to english! I spent almost 2 hours on the phone to linksys and they could not do anything with it. After almost an hour I asked for the supervisor and even he could not get the router to english. They offered to send me a newer version but placed a hold on my credit card of $79! To make matters worse the new one would not even connect to the internet. I contacted tech support but I refused to spend another 2 hours on the phone so I sent it back and will be calling them to remove the hold on my card. I kept the spanish one only until I can find something to replace it other than linksys, it at least connects to the internet but I can't secure it since I can't read or speak spanish! At least I don't live where many could have any access to it.Why would amazon even sell one that is in only spanish!?</review>

<review id="6845">I absolutely agree with the reviewers who rated this book low. I read many of the reviews, then ordered the book to 'see for myself'. I was shocked this was given good reviews by people who claim to be Christians which to me does NOT have anything to do with 'going to church' or being 'religious'. I KNOW God and the word of God and have a living relationship with Him and this book grieves my heart and soul! I had to 'make' myself finish it because I can't stand even reading what I consider to be serious errors in this portrayel of the character of God, the Holy Spirit and Jesus whom I love with all my heart. This is not the God that I know and I almost feel it is a tool being used to further draw people from the truth! In almost every reference to God, the Holy Spirit and Jesus, there is serious contradiction to the word of God. It is not a time to toss out the truth and believe lies but to get back to the basics by knowing the true God, Jesus and Holy Spirit not a man-made facimile!</review>

<review id="6853">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)      There is nothing more to be said about this movie - probably the best superhero film ever made, with a mesmerizing performance by Heath Ledger as the embodiment of chaotic evil - this is a 5-star DVD if ever there was one.  But there is a LOT to be said about this awful, feature-free, completely inadequate 2-disc set.On Disc 1, the movie itself provides no alternative soundtracks, no director/cast/technician commentary, no "music only" version, no alternate versions, no deleted scenes, nothing.  You may as well watch it on Amazon Unbox given the utter absence of extra features.On Disc 2, things get much, much worse.  There are exactly two mini-documentaries - one on the design and implementation of the new Bat-suit and the quasi-motorcycle Bat-pod, one on the evolution of the Joker's "theme sound" for the movie soundtrack.  Both are interesting as far as they go, but in the immortal words of another Warner Brothers hero, "That's all, folks!"  Everything else on the disc is worthless.  I'll list here and you can decide for yourself:- A gallery of movie posters, production stills, and trailers.  The posters and stills are not even presented full-screen - pathetic.- IMAX scenes - The major action set pieces for The Dark Knight were filmed in IMAX, which I had the opportunity to see for myself at an IMAX theater.  The effect in the theater was interesting - when the action took off, the somewhat over-sized widescreen image suddenly exploded into full IMAX.  But what exactly is the point of this feature on DVD?  It's NOT IMAX, obviously, so all we're really seeing is how these scenes looked in their original IMAX-style framing (which is, um, pretty close to 3:4 "full TV screen", kids) before being trimmed down to the "widescreen" format of standard movie screens and newer televisions.  I guess this "feature" might be of interest to fanatics who worry about what they missed at the top and bottom of the screen during those scenes, but to the rest of us, this is a complete snooze-fest (unless you just like the idea of watching all the action scenes back-to-back).- "Gotham Tonight" - the most inexplicable feature of all is this collection of 6 episodes of the fictional "Gotham Tonight" show featured throughout the movie as background and/or commentary on the action from the perspective of local TV news.  Not sure where these came from, or why they were produced, but whatever value they might have had as "deep background" (if that is indeed why they were made), in this context they're just DVD shovelware.Folks, THAT IS *IT*.  The above is *everything* on Disc 2.  Not even a *mention* of the late Heath Ledger, much less the sort of documentary a lot of us would love to see, perhaps featuring recollections of cast and crew about how he created the character that made it onto the screen.  Given this, the fact that the picture used to label Disc 2 is a close-up of the Joker's face just adds insult to injury.I share the opinion of many other customer reviewers I've read here - this is clearly a holiday season rip-off, a quick-and-dirty scheme to rake in a few extra bucks from unsuspecting clods like me who expected WB to release a package worthy of this great movie.  Instead, what we have is an insult to the fans and the film makers.  Save your money and get the single disc if you must, but better still wait for the proper "deluxe edition" that's sure to come next year.  As it stands, the current "special edition" is really, really sad.</review>

The "clogged" error has come up 3 times since I started using the new box and the only thing I see is granules in the hose.</review>

<review id="6855">The dog loved this toy when I gave it to him to play with before Christmas.  The dog however is a strong chewer and it only took 15 minutes before he decided to chew a hole to get the treats out instead of rolling it around on the floor.  It was a pricy toy for one day use so I would suggest they put a rating on it for chewers.</review>

<review id="6856">I bought this as a backup for the microsuede pillowcase I bought at Linens & Things. I wish I had purchased a duplicate of the one I have.  This fabric is rough, and I find the white, unhidden zipper to be very distracting and unappealing.  Overall, I think it looks and feels very cheap.  Another $6 (plus gas or shipping) to get the same microsuede pillowcase I currently have would be well worth it.</review>

<review id="6857">As a sound engineer I am interested in sound quality first. I do not know much about video. When I picked up my HG10 from B&H video the first thing I did was testing what I can do with audio files. Apparently, HG10 creates about 2GB files in size which cannot be combined seamlessly in post production editor. So, if you are shooting 15min episodes or shorter that shouldn't bother you but when it comes to filming concerts and shows this camcorder is not your best choice because at the point where the file was cut you will hear sound dropouts. This limitation is casually mentioned in the manual. I guess, I will be getting some other camcorder because I need to film concerts, recitals and stuff like this.</review>

<review id="6863">First off, I would just like to say that I am a huge Twilight Series fan! I love all four books, and thought they were amazing. So when I found out that the first book was going to be made into a movie - I was so excited! I couldn't wait to go out and see it! Even the previews for the movie looked pretty good!I HATED THE MOVIE! The first time I saw it was in the theater, and the whole time I was just thinking, "If I hadn't of read the book there is no way I would have been able to keep up with this!" They skipped so many scenes (which is understandable since the book was so long) but then the scenes that they wrote in were dumb. They didn't explain a lot of things in the movie, so you are just left sitting there thinking, "What the heck is going on? Why are they acting like that, what did I miss?"I hate, hate, HATED Kristen Stewart's portrayal of Bella - I was so disappointed when I saw her performance. In the books Bella is a lovable, clumsy, observant girl but in the movie she is just so annoying. Robert did an ok job as Edward, but he still has a lot of work to do. The best characters in the movie were Alice, James, Billy, and Charlie - they did awesome. Everyone else needs to work on their characters more. (Emmett's character doesn't make either list since the poor guy only had like, 3 lines in the whole movie). In short, if you haven't read the books yet - don't see the movie or you might not be able to keep up or understand what is going on. If you have read the series, watch the movie more than once in order to appreciate the movie. It's better the second time around, because now you know what to expect.</review>

<review id="6864">This is one of the most cheaply made products I have ever seen.  As other reviews have mentioned, they are so thin you can see right through them.  They are also not well designed.  My little ones do not stay perfectly still when they sleep.  Unfortunately, pretty much any movement by the kids and the long sides come up over the pad. I found some fitted sheets that actually stay on at [...].  The mom hand makes them, and she actually went out of her way to find a fabric that I liked.  They are soft, stylish, and affordable.  A much better option, in my opinion, plus I know I'm helping out another mom instead of some giant corporation!</review>

<review id="6869">The controller itself is made of decent quality. The sticks are accurate and recenter themselves well, the analog shoulder buttons have a nice tactile feel, and the buttons are responsive and not mushy. HOWEVER, Logitard was smart enough to  put a sleep mode function into the controller. So, if you're playing a game  where you switch between keyboard and controller (BF2 for example) and it's  been 10 minutes or so since you've used the controller. When you goto use the controller you'll quickly realize that the controller is asleep! What makes it even better is that you have to COMPLETELY exit the game and restart to get the game to recognize the controller. And there's nothing better than have 10 guys yell at you over TS because you have to restart the game in the middle of a match.Go Logitard!</review>

<review id="6870">I purchased this movie for my better-half and I to watch on Valentines day, figuring it was a bit of a romantic movie to settle into and watch while we cuddled.  We are fans of both actors and thought it would be a good movie.  We were both disappointed.  Now, I do believe in Love-at-first-sight.  But they did not appear to be those type of people in this movie and they were not really convincing that that is what actually occurred.  The ending was a bit of a surprise; but the leading ladies reaction was also unbelievable.  She basically curled up and left her kids to fend for themselves after just like 4 days of know this guy...Give me a break!</review>

<review id="6871">I'm 46 years old, and I bought the first 3 books for my teenage son.  He liked them so much that I read them myself; I was pleasantly surprised!  Although Meyer's writing is amateurish in places, she absolutely knows how to tell a tale.  For the most part, I was mesmerized.  In fact, I read the trilogy twice.  And there was so much great story build-up, and so much opportunity for character growth and excitement in this 4th book; I bought it at midnight and read it all night so my son could have it the next day.  Wow, am I ever disappointed.To me, the first book was without question the strongest.  The second book was also strong and I really enjoyed the dynamic of the Jacob relationship.  It's true that Bella's incessant whining and ludicrously melodramatic pining for Edward (God, shut UP already about your 'wound'!) was aggravating enough to take me out of the story several times - but really, I couldn't put it down.  The third book was the weakest of the trilogy, in that there is very little action until the end, the school storyline was all but dropped, and there wasn't a lot of character development - especially from Perpetual Victim Bella, who continued to be incredibly needy and dependent (while inexplicably attractive to every male in Washington), as well as in peril at all times (I hope that doesn't make other young women WANT to be victims!).  But still, as I say, the series overall was gripping and enjoyable enough to have me impatiently awaiting Breaking Dawn.[SPOILERS]While I was waiting - I was hopeful.  I was hopeful that Bella would grow as a person and not be so needy(and tearful, and prone to fainting, and melodramatic, and selfish).  And I was REALLY hopeful that Bella would realize how incredibly dysfunctional her relationship with Edward was.  (I know the young girls LOVE Edward but please consider for a moment if his personality was NOT packaged in a perfect body with an angel face and velvet voice, as well as super strength and speed, a nice car, and piles of money. Imagine if Edward's personality was in a scruffy working-class joe.  I have to believe that most would then see his overbearing over-protectiveness and his controlling domineering nature as just what they are - sick and unpleasant.)  I felt that there was some good foreshadowing in the 2nd book (how unhealthy her mourning of Edward was & how she felt better with Jacob) and in the 3rd book (how she realized that she also loved Jacob & and how she was scared to become immortal)that gave me hope that in the end, Bella would see Edward for what he was - her first crush (and yes, those first loves are cripplingly strong) but not her forever love.  Neediness is not love!  Being told what to do and what to drive and who to be friends with is not being loved!  Being a victim is not sexy!  Desire to forsake your friends, family, and humanity is NOT healthy!  Stephanie Meyer had a great opportunity to show the growth of a young woman, to show the maturity that Bella could have gained that would have made her see the unhealthiness in her relationship(s)...  Bella could have acknowledged the Odious Edward as a first love and someone who would always have a place in her heart, but not someone with whom she'd spend eternity - forsaking her own identity in the process.  Bella could even have wound up as a College Freshman who cares about friends and education and life - without a boyfriend for a while!  There's huge opportunity for character growth there - as well perhaps as a lesson of sorts to Meyer's young readers.  But Meyer cops out incredibly.  Bella stays with Edward AND becomes immortal AND does not have to deal with any consequences for this (WTH?) AND has a baby (!) at 19.  What sort of a message is this?  During the entire tedious book I was cringing to imagine young impressionable girls fantasizing about finding a boyfriend who would tell them what to do, and be jealous of any other man they are friends with, and  over-protect them so they never have to learn to take care of themselves, and provide for them so they never have to learn to provide for themselves... a boyfriend they would give up everything for... but it would all be okay and have a happy ending and they would live happily ever after.  It sickened me.  All I can say is that I hope that the young women of today are mature and self-confident enough to take this series for what it is - an exciting fantasy tale - and not actually dream of an 'Edward' in their lives.ETA:I see that a lot of people are saying that the negative reviewers (such as myself) have a problem with happy endings.  I have no problems at all with happy endings!  What I have a problem with are happy endings that are too easy, and too neat, and require retcon and deus ex machinas galore to achieve.  They aren't 'real' - and of course I don't mean that vampires are real so everything in the book should be realistic - I mean that they aren't true to the story or, in this case, even to the canon of the story.  Things like that are a slap in the face to devoted fans - such as myself- who have invested time, money, thought, and emotion into these characters and this story, and (rightly) expect a good payoff - a conclusion that works within the framework that the author herself has created.The author herself spent 3 books outlining and detailing the many things that Bella would have to give up in order to join the Cullens.  She set up the dilemma, the choice that Bella had to make.  And then she turned around and allowed Bella to become immortal (& stay with Edward) without actually having to lose anything or make any sacrifices at all!  It's fake, unearned, 'cheat' endings like this that I have a problem with - not happiness per se.I do personally have a problem with Uber-Controlling Edward (I prefer hot to cold, life to death),  but I know that a lot of people like the Bella/Edward romance.  Stephanie Meyer could have kept Bella and Edward together and still given a conclusion that would be palatable to me, and others.  All she had to do was stick to the canon of her world, and have Bella go through the things we thought she'd go through (losing friends and family, newborn-vamp strife, giving up the ability to have a child, etc) to become a vampire... and the inherent conflict in that (plus perhaps an Epic Battle or 2) would have made for a meaty read that stayed 'true' and was therefore satisfying.  But, as I said, she copped out and made it all too easy.This ISN'T a fairy tale.  Fairy Tales are for young children.  This is a series for adults - both young & old - and I expect a mature level of writing that reflects that.  I didn't get it with BD, and I am pissed off about it.</review>

<review id="6873">I purchased this product having gone through a few over the years.  It has always been a reliable product and I have used it very well.  This time; however, it simply did not work. It dropped connections, the admin pages wouldn't come up...it just didn't work. Then I learned why.  Linksys, in order to save money, gutted the product, replaced the operating system, cut the memory in half and essentially reverse engineered a d-link.  So...naturally, it is now about as reliable as a d-link.  Luckily, I learned that they kept the original version in the market for people who do their homework.  It's under the model number WRT54GL (L for Linux).  I did; however, learn the hard way, so I now have a $50 paperweight to show for linksys/cisco's stupid decision.  Now, I have to second-guess all of my purchases of linksys equipment.  Why did they have to do that to us and to themselves?</review>

<review id="6875">I bought this as an upgrade from my d-link DI-524 router, because I needed something more dependable for wireless, and something with a better signal (and performance).  Overall, I have zero improvement from my last router, and its just as undependable, if not more.  There are some improvements in the interface, but not worth the $125+ you'll spend.CONS:First off, I have a new thinkpad that supports the 802.11n protocol, and I am able to connect at a very pleasant 300Mbps.  However, I get disconnected about every 5-10 minutes, and I have to reconnect.  This is annoying, and as soon as I turned off 802.11n support, the problem went away.  So don't count on getting any "xtreme" performance from this router.  I know that 802.11n is draft, but I'd still expect it to work a little more than 5-10 minutes at a time.Second, overall the router disconnects from the DSL line randomly every few days, and it takes it several minutes and sometimes a reboot to connect again.  My old router would even go for weeks without disconnection issues.  This is a bit discouraging when the whole idea is to spend top dollar to get the latest router for the most dependability and performance.PROS:  Decent interface with lots of options.  Still, there may be too many options with too many links and buttons, the interface can be jumbled and more complex than it needs to be.  Possibly the effect of over-development.  The range is good on the router, but its not outstanding.  Again, maybe a slight improvement over my last d-link (classic $30 DI-524).  I definitely expected to get 70-80% in my tiny condo, but I don't, and I've taken the precautions of mounting it away from any interference, and my phones are all on the 5.8GHz bandwidth.SUMMARY:If you need something very dependable, I would reconsider purchasing this router.  If you are looking for draft 802.11n speeds, don't buy this router.  I work from home so I need something up 99.9% of the time, and this hasn't been doing the job for what I paid.  The router has lots of options and a sleek appearance, but this is second to performance and dependability in my book.  Maybe wait a few firmware patches or models before buying...I gave it two stars due to the money spent in proportion to the dependability and performance I have experienced.  Overall I'm not sure why I keep buying d-link.  Their customer support is sub-par, and their products aren't the best.  Linksys is probably a better product.</review>

<review id="6876">This coffeepot is barely OK.  The cup has a really strong new plastic smell - I ran it through the dishwasher twice and keep soaping it in really hot water, but it still makes the coffee taste weird (I also keep running the coffee pot with plain water in case the cause is the maker as well). I have yet to enjoy a cup of coffee from it, I deal with it, but with every sip I think of how weird it taste.  Also it makes LOTS of noise brewing. I have it at work in my cube, it is NO secret when I am percolating.  If I were doing it over again I would spend a few more $$ and get a better pot.</review>

<review id="6877">I bought this 12G Asus EEE PC when I had business trip in Taiwan.  Every thing works fine, and I enjoy it a lot due to improved screen size comparing with 1st generated EEE PC.  However, the SSD size is a pain.  It comes with 4G one for OS and another 8G one for users to install other softwares or storage personal files.  It's not enough for sure.  We can use SD card for extra storage, but that's another $80 for 8G SD card.  You also need to plug in and out the SD cards when you want to copy pictures from another SD (Camrea uses one).  It makes way more troubles, so I returned it to the store next day and got another 20G Linux one.The linux 20G Asus EEE PC is way better, it's 4G + 16G SSD.  You will get another extra 8G, which will make you smile.  It's very easy to install Window XP into the system. The key is change "OS Installaion" from "Finished" to "Start" in the BIOS.You can easier to buy Window XP Home from the market around $90 or Window XP PRO from the market around $140.  The CD also includes the Windows drivers, even you buy the Linux 20G Asus EEE PC. Therefore, you don't need to worry about Window XP drivers.I guess the reason for Asus to use 12G instead of 20G for Asus EEE PC 900 with Window XP Home due to the Microsoft license cost.  If you don't mind to pay for the extra Window XP license fee, it will get you extra 8GB internal SSD space.  You will enjoy this EEE PC more.Suggestion:Go for the 20G Linux one!!! (I also ordered another Linux 20G one for my wife on Amazon.com. Hope they will ship it out soon.)</review>

<review id="6878">I bought one of these at our school bookstore last week (which had *boxes* of them) and have had nothing but problems with it.  I wanted to use this to transfer files between my desktop (WinXP) and laptop (Leopard) but when I move more then 100 megs at a time, it tells me I don't have permission and the transfer freezes.  It won't let me eject or shut down (because it thinks it's still copying) so I have to pull the drive out and relaunch Finder.  Basically, I'm using an 8gig drive to move less than 100 megs at a time.  I can do that much more effectively with my old 1 gig.Just taking its ability to work with WinXP into consideration, I'd give it a higher rating if the transfer speed wasn't so inconsistent and slow. Nothing against Kingston though.  They're still my favorite RAM manufacturer but they failed on this one.</review>

<review id="6880">I have been using TT Basic for many years, and it has served my needs quite well, until now! I am a real estate agent and therefore need to file a Sch. C - "Profit or Loss From Business". The program kept trying to use Sch. C-EZ even though it specifically stated that, if my expenses exceeded $5,000 (they did), I had to use Sch. C. I had to use the "Forms" mode of the program (not user friendly) to get my return prepared correctly. If I had filed the first return TT came up with, my refund would have been $964 vs $2625 that it was when I finally got it fixed. TT wanted an additional $70 for the "TT Home & Business" Version of their software, which I assume was the easier way to complete my return, yet they never stated that using this version of the software would be as user unfriendly as they could possibly make it, and it could have easily cost me $1661, if I had not persevered. I am also a Quicken user, and you can read of my experience with the new version of that software under "See all my reviews."

<review id="6881">Although I was able to get it to work for a couple days on my Windows XP SP2 system, I came in this morning and the adapter had no power. I unplugged it from my D-Link DUB-H7 7-port powered USB 2.0 Hub and plugged it back in the same port. Still no power. I realized that the power LED associated with that port on the hub was not lit where as all the other ports were lit showing they had power.So I tried plugging in the DPH-50U into another port on the hub. the power light on the DPH-50U went on for a split second and then went out. The power LED on my hub then went out too.So like an idiot, I plugged the DPH-50U into yet another port on my hub and the same thing happened. So now 3 ports on my HUB no longer have power because they were shorted out by the DPH-50U. I suspect it's because the DPH-50U draws too much power? But it was working 24-7 for a couple days.So I called D-Link and they said they can't issue an RMA for the DPH-50U unless I try plugging it directly into my computer. But I am afraid it will short out that port on my motherboard and ruin that too! But their tech support said that they can't issue an RMA until I've tried everything over the phone. I explained to them that I don't want to risk killing my motherboard too and he said, "I understand you don;t want to risk it, but if you don't do it, we can't issue an RMA." What?!?! They want me to risk killing my motherboard just to see if it's working?So to top it off, I called D-Link customer service and they said that since my D-Link hub is out of warranty, they won't fix it even though THEIR DPH-50U caused the malfunction. I can see their point that they are not responsible for any damage caused by their products, but they won't even repair an in-warranty item unless I risk damaging additional hardware which they are not responsible for. That sucks!I guess I am just SOL.Buyer beware...</review>

<review id="6884">This DVD is all style and no substance.  It consists of a bunch of empty slogans spoken in soothing voices by a bunch of sincere, smiling "experts" (philosophers, a metaphysician, a "visionary").  These are all spliced together with fictional scenes in a way that makes the whole thing seem kind of disjointed and manic.  These scenes are simplistic and laughable - a giant genie offering to fulfill your every wish, a man in Roman times copying some text (the "secret," we are to presume) and then being chased through a tunnel, a woman seeing a necklace she likes receives it as a gift after visualizing it.The "Secret" insults my intelligence.  I'm blessed with the ability to reason and think critically, and I know that when something promises to be the "secret" to EVERYTHING I'VE EVER WANTED, it's too good to be true.Think positively and work towards your goals,  but don't think that the universe is going to provide you with all of your petty little material wants simply because you really really want them.  Definitely don't waste your money on this drivel.  The only people getting rich off of the "Secret" are the participants.</review>

<review id="6885">What a poor excuse for a mini-series.Please, explain to me why these advanced humanoids, living in some remote part of the galaxy and obvious far more technically advanced based on their level of space travel, wear suits and ties and dress like us poor Earthlings do? Doesn't the series have a wardrobe budget? Even the original series had its own futuristic clothing.The original Battlestar Galactica series used the same combat footage over and over again to save money. But, at least we saw real looking robots. This series is so cheap, that they decided to make the Cylons "act and look exactly like humans" to save a little money. What a shame! The whole idea of the series was "people against robots". What ever happened to that original concept for the series? What is with the blond-haired Cylon bimbo? Can't they sell the series on the story itself? Do they really need sex to get me to watch? I find her character very irritating and unnecessary.My list of complaints goes on, but I'll save you the reading. Watch the series yourself. It would be worth a good laugh if it were not so boring and shallow.This new series is simply a soap opera with a few special effects and the Battlestar Galactica name thrown in for name recognition. It is poorly done and an insult to the original Battlestar Galactica series for which it is named. If this is an example of the sci-fi to come, its time to unplug the cable and throw away the TV. Playing in a cardboard box would be far more entertaining and interesting.</review>

<review id="6886">Excel is probably one of the best applications in existence in the business world. Power Point is quite pedestrian, which is good for some executives, and quick-presentation fixes. Outlook is great, but here's where it all ends.WORD is simply an exercise in futility, and more of a waste of time than ever. I learned how to create stunning page layouts in Adobe InDesign faster (my first attempts at using Adobe products outside Photoshop) than I could master an already familiar program-Word. This is because Word suffers from formatting and alignment idiosyncrasies which will burn the user who attempts to delve into any special features, or who attempt to customize even the simplest of things. I recommend using Word for the most basic and time-saving uses, but if you want to create a document that utilizes any advanced features, you will be much more satisfied learning what the Pro's use on a daily basis.</review>

<review id="6887">I wanted something light and compact to record my son's soccer games and birthdays, family events, etc. While this would probably be fine for the other events, it was very poor quality for the fast-moving soccer game. It was okay when holding still, but following the players was pretty much a blur and the still shots so far at any distance are VERY poor, I'm pretty disappointed after researching and being so excited to get this model. Great price at Costco, however ours is going back. I was unable to change the recording mode from the default, which won't publish to the web as far as I can tell, which is highly disappointing. The tutorial is very limited and the software not much more of a help. Pretty disappointed all around.</review>

<review id="6888">Like all other Cuisinart products I own, this is a waste of money. Every time I make coffee there is a puddle of water under the machine. The caraf is not designed to pour coffee-it spills on the counter every time. And unless there's a spotlight shining down the water tank or you're making 8 cups or more, it's very difficult to know how much water you are adding.</review>

<review id="6889">The rest of the reviewers have hit the features spot-on.  However, having failed after likely less than 100GB of total transfer, this device has failed.  It now no longer powers on in any computer and I have lost all data on the drive.For transporting data, it seems to be okay.  Just be sure that you're not using it as a backup device or as the primary storage device.</review>

<review id="6891">As soon as I installed the windows the system started crashing on me showing blue screen. Something I forgot it existed. Since this is my travel notebook and I travel a lot so I call local ASUS service center (in Sydney Australia) to find out that the EEEE PC has not have Global warranty and I have to pay for repair. I will try to call the service center in US and try to ship it back to US. Else laptop is good (when it works) one minus: the right shift key is in the wrong place.</review>

<review id="6892">This monitor provided poor results.  I compared it to readings at home with an Omron wrist monitor (ModelRX2).  It typically reads 20-25 units higher than the wrist monitor for both systolic and diastolic.  The wrist monitor has been reasonably consistent and agrees well with my readings at the doctor's office, and another wrist monitor (HEM-608). I took this monitor to the doctor's office as well, and it was 30 units higher than the nurse's and doctor's measurements.  My doctor recommended I not use it.  He was more pleased with my wrist monitor.  As such I have returned the HEM-90IT and am using the wrist monitor since I have much more confidence in it.  I bought this unit for its computer record keeping, but its not worth it if I have little confidence in the numbers.</review>

<review id="6894">The contempt and arrogance of the designers of previous users is downright scary.   Every review I read that claims the Office upgrade is anything but a catastrophe, I have to wonder who signs their paycheck.  If you know the office suite well, heaven forbid an expert, the Word, PowerPoint or Excel upgrades are at best a very painful experience,  Finding the high end features will frustrate the heck out of you.  There is no choice either; you have to learn everything again.  To be fair, the suite works fine, however, everything I've ever learned every functional or utilitarian approach is lost.  Lost is the analogy for the whole upgrade.  I can't believe I paid Microsoft to torture me like this.</review>

<review id="6895">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      I read Twilight over a dozen times, and could hardly wait until New Moon came out.  What a huge disappointment; it struck me as basically back story and cheap attempts at making some of the foreshadowing in Twilight come true.For example, in Twilight Bella swore she would do whatever was necessary to save Edward's "life" - he, of course, kept telling her that was ridiculous.  Well, guess what ...I'll probably read Eclipse - see if the storyline can get back on track.  But, I basically felt very ripped off by the end of New Moon.</review>

<review id="6896">The possible reasons one would want to get an icecream maker would be to either make great tasting icecream, make inexpensive icecream or better yet make great tasting  and inexpensive icecream.  Unfortunately after many trials I found that none of the above happened in this machine.  I tried many recipes from premium to icemilk, from full cream to vegan, and none of them were worth the effort.  In fact, I found that most of the icecream was only barely edible.  I believe that the icecream we made in this machine was the only icecream EVER that actually languished in our fridge (this is saying a lot for a family of icecream fiends).  Worse still, making your own icecream proved to be actually more expensive (not to mention time consuming) than buying it at the supermarket.  All in all I don't see a good enough reason why I would want to spend the time and money on this item, it just isn't worth it.</review>

<review id="6897">I bought the kitchenaid pro 600 series and the first time I turned it on it was obvious it wasn't working right. I ran it on the "stir" setting with the bowl empty and it went so fast I thought it was going to take flight. It ran at this speed for 2 seconds and then just quit, it does nothing if I turn the speed up higher. If I turn it back off and then back to the "stir" setting it does the same thing. I read through the whole manual and didn't see anything about this being a "feature". The lemon goes back tomorrow.</review>

<review id="6898">I purchased this item specifically to use with my Vista PC and enable the drive for Readyboost. The alleged "Hi-Speed" USB drive doesn't meet Microsoft's requirements and I now cannot use it for the sole purpose of purchasing it. Funny thing, 1 GB SD card does meet readyboost requirements. Of course that SD card isn't made by Corsair. I've got lot's of spare storage devices. Oh well, guess I've got another.</review>

<review id="6899">This birdhouse seemed to work initially. I have four small terrier-like dogs and they usually bark at the birds in the trees or dog in the next yard. It's been about a month.I read the whole manual and understood it. I put the birdhouse on the HIGHEST setting "setting #3" which equals 50 feet and the results I've gotten are mixed. Sometimes they bark and other times not. The manual says give it 2 weeks, but it has been over a month now and the barking is still pretty constant. Personally I feel like I was robbed. I'm not sure if it's even worth sending back and wasting more time. If you can buy it in the store and it doesn't work it would be easier to get your money back.</review>

<review id="6900">I got this pedometer in February.  It is easy to use and much more accurate than the pedometers that I ever owned.  However, just like these cheap ones, it died just in less two months.  It is still in warranty and I may replace it with Omron, if the shipping charge is not too much.  But I am very disappointed with the quality.</review>

<review id="6901">BUYER BEWARE! This product has no follow up service. I have a faulty and defective brush head which has caused mold to grown inside the unit. I contacted customer service and they told me to send in the Model Number and they would replace the unit and brush heads. When I replied to their email I received a non-delivery status, FOUR TIMES! When contacting customer service via telephone they stated they couldn't replace anything because I didn't have proof of purchase. I suppose owning the unit isn't enough. Don't expect anything from Sonicare if you have a problem. Buy your toothbrush from another manufacturer. When I finally contacted another representative she told me the email is sent out by a person who has no control and just returns emails and says whatever it is they want to say. Caveat Emptor!!!</review>

<review id="6902">I switched to TaxCut some years ago, and have been a satisfied customer until I purchased the Home & Business version last year.  While I was satisfied with the personal product last year, the business product was of such poor quality (I'm talking about software quality) that I swore I'd never make the mistake of buying it again.  How soon we forget!  I've purchased the 2008 edition, and just as last year, the business product is worse than shoddy work, it's atrocious!  The software would not install on my XP system, and customer support was clueless.  Because I am a consultant in software process improvement, I'm technically adept enough to figure out that I could install the business product by shutting down all Windows services prior to the install.  Are you kidding me?!  What technically unsophisticated consumer would ever be able to figure this out?  Once I succeeded in installing the product, it appeared to update to the latest release properly, and reported that the product is up-to-date.  While it appears to function normally, it vaguely reports an "incompatible software" error at startup and says it cannot run until the incompatability is resolved. I've wasted hours on this, and won't be wasting any more. Head whack! I could shoot myself for being sucker enough to buy this turkey a second time.  Since I paid good $$$ for it, I think I'll stick with the personal product one last time, but I'm headed off to buy TurboTax for my business return.  After years as a custumer, I won't buy H&R Block software again. They appear to have zero quality control where the business version of TaxCut is concerned.  Don't say you haven't been warned!</review>

<review id="6903">Eclipse (The Twilight Saga) is the third book in Stephanie Meyer's much over hyped "Twilight Saga" after Twilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1) and New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2).  Somehow, between book one and book three, Stephanie Meyer's writing ability and course for the novels has disintegrated into a teen angst fest peppered with an inadequate plot.Eclipse progresses the story of the excessively boring heroine Bella Swan, who falls in love with a vampire and often finds herself in the middle of heated conflicts between the Cullen family and their enemies.  Eclipse continues where both the first and second book left off, with Victoria still boundlessly hunting after Bella, and the love triangle between Edward, Bella and Jacob intensifying.  Add a group of serial killing newborn vampires on the loose in Seattle who appear to be out for Bella's blood, and you've got Eclipse: one hell of a big mess.Where Twilight was a very promising start for the series and New Moon left much to be desired, Eclipse was mediocre at best.  This novel, at an overwritten 629 pages, was not only mind numbingly dull, it was downright painful.  The plot simply was not strong enough to carry the book the entire way and the reader certainly could not depend upon the heroine to make that journey any better.  With a weak plot and an even more ineffectual protagonist, Meyer bombarded the reader with a love triangle so arduous, I found myself leaving the book alone for extended periods of time before steeling myself to continue reading.The storytelling itself just plods along, almost as though it's going through the motions, with little or no passion involved.  This book read as though it was a rough draft, basically what the author pens just to get the initial story down before going back and breathing life into the narrative.  Eclipse shared the back stories of some main characters to provide insight into how they became vampires, but the set ups were written awkwardly and the presentations themselves were ho-hum.  More than that, they went on for what seemed like forever--indeed, the page count would be significantly less if the reader were not overwhelmed with these rather needless back stories.  While I accept that Meyer wanted the reader to gain a better understanding of her characters, these stories simply didn't fit into the plot of the book itself and would have been better served and more appreciated as stand-alone short stories.  As it was, they interrupted the flow of the novel, whereas it might have gone more smoothly in their absence.The characters involved in the series have either not progressed at all since book one, or they have regressed and have become more bothersome than intriguing.  Jacob, who showed up briefly in book one and became more prominent in book two, went from being a sweet, good-natured boy to a hulking brute who threatened suicide over Bella's reluctance to suck face with him.  I understand that Meyer attempted to make his character more appealing as a love interest for the heroine, but his fervent ardor came on so strong, it was nearly obsessive.  More than that, his overenthusiastic infatuation was too much of a contrast to his amiable nature before his change.  Meyer might have attributed this shift in temperament to Jacob's becoming a werewolf, but there was little consistency.  Perhaps she was looking for some contrast to Edward and Bella's relationship, which is so lackluster, I feel sorry for both parties involved.  The two not only have little in the way of chemistry, but their frequent declarations of suicide if they can't be together are absolutely cringe-worthy.  Although I do have to hand it to Meyer, dealing with Edward's moping over Bella as well as his incurable vampirism is infinitely more appealing than Jacob's raging hormones and irritatingly cocky attitude.  But I still can't seem to figure out what either one of them see in Bella Swan, the plain-as-mud human who managed--er...somehow--to capture both their hearts.  Bella's perspective reads more like an outline, a shell where their should be soul.  There is so little emotion there, so little substance, there is nary a heroine in all of teen literature who could compete with her when it comes to monotonous first person.  Meyer gives little reason, other than her apparently wonderful tasting blood, for why this human is so appealing to just about everyone.  Enemies always want to kill her, and those who don't love her and want to be her friend.  Ah, yes, this author could not have written a more textbook example of a Mary Sue.  The author writes her as so overwhelmingly meritorious, it's like eating birthday cake--so sweet it makes one ill.  I hope Meyer has better luck writing Breaking Dawn (The Twilight Saga, Book 4) and understands that substance, consistency, and the relay of emotion are even more essential than a page count.</review>

<review id="6904">Acrobat 8 has never integrated with Office 2007, or worked right with my scanner, so I foolishly bought Acrobat 9 in the hope it would be an improvement. It's not.It seems Adobe simply focused on jamming more features into an already bloated and buggy application making things even worse. The office 2007 integration *still* does not work--even after spending hours trying the suggested solutions from Adobe. Beware, even for this $300 product, Adobe CHARGES for any phone support beyond basic installation help.In addition to not working with Office 2007, Acrobat 9 is slow, throws up frequent error messages, and leaves part of itself running even after you shut it down which keeps Windows from shutting down without clicking past an "Acrobat has stopped responding" message. I also had trouble with Adobe's finicky product activation.Memo to Adobe: More features are useless if the basics don't work reliably. People don't want products that take 20 minutes to install, forever to load, require hours of searching for and trying various support solutions to no avail, throw up frequent error messages, etc. Someone else needs to come along (Google are you listening?) and derail Adobe's PDF train with a simple, reliable product that's more like Acrobat used to be in the old days (say version 5). For the 3% of the PDF users who actually *need* all the extra obscure publishing features, they can still buy Adobe's buggy bloatware. The rest of us just want reliable basic PDF support that works with the current applications and standards.</review>

<review id="6905">Others had a problem with the retracting mechanism... I've used mine a lot, and lent it to ppl and haven't had a problem. Others find the gravity blade retraction mechanism unique (read downright kewl) and the metal flap over the business end is unique.I don't like the extraneous junk the drive came with. In fact I had to uninstall the U3 utility (in XP) before it would work on my 2 vista machines. -They claim newer U3 versions work with Vista, but what a waste of time. Reformatting with NTFS wasn't enough. Gave the stick a bad review because of bloatware.</review>

<review id="6906">I used turbo-tax last year and only switched back to taxcut because I thought I was getting a much better bang for my buck. That is until I went to efile state return and found out I had to shell out an extra 19.95 to do it. I'm peeved because I feel mislead by their title which leads one to believe that you get and efile for both fed and state. Yeah, I should have researched the literature a little closer, but I'm tired of all the games intuit and h& r block play with us hard working, tax paying weekend accountants. This program wasn't that hot anyway. It wouldn't import my brokerages's info (score another one for turbotax here),and there were several glitches when I tried to print and mail state info. For one, they gave me the wrong information on what to include with my state return and, if I hadn't caught the mistake, Michigan probably would have returned my forms and told me to make the necessary corrections. I'll give them 2 stars. One for effort and one for keeping their price lower than the competition. But next year I'm not using their program.</review>

<review id="6907">I was hoping this camera would be everything the reviews claimed it to be. Perhaps the one I received had something wrong with it but all the video came out very over exposed in all lighting conditions and blurry. It was especially bad in the one to four foot range, you could not tell a butterfly was a butterfly from that entire range it was so blurry. There are no adjustments just point and press a button so it was nothing I was doing wrong. The video advertisement shows someone holding this camera very close to a monarch butterfly and the image on the camera looks perfect. This was not the case with mine. I sent it back as defective, hopefully they are not all this bad. Too bad because it was so small and light and simple to use.</review>

<review id="6908">I bought a new Mac with Leopard and Office 2008 because I dislike Vista. I expected greater stability and reliability than I had with Windows. On the third day of my using Word, it crashed and completely vaporized my document and did not provide autorecover. I have used Word for many years and never had anything remotely like this happen, even when there was a power failure at my house.If the data is not secure, it's hard to be interested in anything else the software suite does.</review>

<review id="6909">I went through three of these before I got one that worked...bad LCD screens.  They could have been defective, but the also may have been damaged in shipping, because Amazon is not packing these very well and UPS seems to be really rough on the boxes.  Anyway, these are a slightly cheaper version of the MSI Wind.  I highly recommend you spend the extra $$ and get the Wind, because the quality of the Wind is so much better. (I have a Wind now).  You can tell as soon as you hold it in your hand...everything is sturdier and the keyboard is much less spongy. I really liked the look of the Magni Elite, and I really really wanted to keep it, but the quality just isn't there.  Spend the extra $$ and get the Wind.  You'll be much happier.  Sylvania is not fooling anyone!</review>

<review id="6910">I bought this item based on the Product Details which state:"Powers via USB or FireWire connection"This is simply false!  The drive comes with an AC adapter which it needs for power, and connecting the USB cable alone does not power it.Also, while it has a USB port, I see no FireWire port.Moreover, calling this drive "portable" is a bit of an exaggeration.  This drive is comparable in size and weight to the Iomega silver series drives which are not advertised as "portable".  Truly portable drives are drives such as the Smartdisk Firelite, which are lightweight and pocket-sized, and really do power through the USB with no AC adapter.I should have known it was too good to be true - nobody is selling an external hard drive with capacity beyond ~250 GB that is powered only by USB.  All 500 GB drives require an AC adapter and are well beyond pocket size.</review>

<review id="6911">QB for Mac is not completely useless but it has so many lacks, quirks, and errors that I often feel like firebombing intuit. Luckily I reach into my drawer, grab the "emergency medicinal liquid" and a shot glass and the feeling passes. I am in the process of looking at other software for our medical practice. Honestly QB is not good, and the only thing worse is there "tech" support, which in my experience ranges from vague referrals for "operator error" to their favorite advice, "reinstall and start from scratch."Frankly if I can't find something I will either buy a windoze computer for accounting only, or I will go back to paper and pen, which could not possibly take less time than QB in it's current form. If someone comes up with a better product, intuit is dead for mac.</review>

<review id="6913">This is not the book I expected to read. I can't explain what I was expecting but it just wasn't what was on the page. I found (spolier alert!) the pregnancy out of left field, the imprinting, while creepy, too obvious and the ending while fun to read seems, in the end, to be all build-up and no pay-off. Yes, Bella and Edward get their happy ending and I am quite satisfied with many of the reveals - Bella as a vampire etc, getting a part of the story from Jacob's p.o.v....but it just seems like their could have been more. i'm left thinking "thats it?". I wanted to be left breathless and I do not think that I am alone. Another complaint is the lack of love scenes. Okay, I wasn't expecting NC-17 or anything graphic but I was expecting more build-up, more feeling. It was all done after-the-fact which just seemed odd. Their was more sensuality in scenes in Eclipse then there was Breaking Dawn. I am a huge, huge adult fan of the books, my friends would describe me as "obsessed" but I am disappointed in this lackluster finale.</review>

<review id="6914">Yes indeed, this water pick does all that it is supposed to. It's very good at cleaning, and ha lots of nice accessories that can be conveniently stored in the cover. The reservoir stores plenty of water, and the pressure variation dial allows you to choose the strength of flow. If you have never used a waterpik before here's an interesting observation. Even after carefully brushing and flossing my teeth the waterpik dislodged additional food particles that the brush and floss operations missed. The Waterpik seems to be well made. I also own a water jet made by a competitor that I've found to be very flimsy (Conair).My big problem with the Waterpik is its intermittent leaking. I make sure that the tank and the pick attachment are properly seated yet the machine will periodically and inexplicably start to leak. I will go in the bathroom at various times during the day and find that everything is OK with it. Then I will make another trip and find the Waterpik sitting in a puddle of water. To be able to use it without having this problem I have to empty the storage container after every use. That's something you are not supposed to have to do. In reading other reviews of the Waterpik on the internet I've found that I am not alone in having this problem.</review>

<review id="6917">Do not buy this attachment.  We used it(following the instructions) for about 10 min. grinding about 3 lbs of lean meat and the main drive gear of the MIXER broke.

<review id="6919">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      While the "becoming Batman" parts of "Batman Begins" were a welcome addition to the Batman canon, this one pales in comparison to the Tim Burton Batmans. Burton's had much more character development, and a lesser body count. The Burton ones cinematography and set were much more "other worldly" and interesting. While this one had better technology, the effects got to be headache-inducing in it's overlong 2 1/2 hours. I also prefer Michael Keaton/Jack Nicholson to Bale/Ledger, and the Danny Elfman score for the Burton movies was preferable of course.While they are huge box office hits, I really wish Hollywood would stop regurgitating Batmans/Hulks/etc. with better effects but less nuance, and writing something original!</review>

<review id="6923">I must be getting old because I'm really impressed that some of you found this device anything other than dissapointing.  Guess I've been spoiled by my Tivo and ipod.  In concept I was really excited about this device.  I wanted to move a bunch of mpeg4 movies and stuff from my computer and Tivo to this drive but it doesn't see any of them when plugged into a TV.  Advertising says it plays mpeg4 but it doesn't.... guess the truth is somewhere in the troubleshoot section of the manual.... ahhhh workarounds.  Apparently I'm not smart enough to read between the lines anymore.... maybe it's time to start reading the manuals.... ohhhhh nooooooooooo.  So I moved King Kong directly to the drive from DVD but all I get disfunctionality.  Giant time-suck.  There are probably work arounds that involve pushing buttons in secret combinations but I want easy.  I bought this for the convenience but all I've found is one work-around after another.  Something I'd be willing to deal with ten years ago when all tech required an inner-geek.  If you're looking for file storage this device works fine... but I'd point out that you can get twice the storage for the same price if you don't need the disfunctional video features.  ScreenPlay.... you're not ready for primetime.</review>

<review id="6926">If you are looking for a review of the product itself, please skip to the bottom of this 'review'. The following describes my experience with Telebrands. I ordered this online through the pedipaws (telebrands) website figuring that since I could not get free shipping through Amazon, it would be cheaper to pay $19.99 than what is offered here. To make a long story short, even though I checked off the option to NOT get the "bonus" de-shedding tool, it was added to my bill (free with $8 S&H). I wanted to fix this issue ASAP. I ordered on Saturday but could not call until Monday. I called on Monday and while they had not processed my order and thus could not find it, the person on the phone said "everyone gets that whether they check the option or not". At this point, I decided to cancel but again, was told that since they didn't have the order, there was nothing to cancel. I was told to call back on Wednesday. In the meantime, I gave the credit card company a heads-up. I then found another number on the Telebrands website and called back (still on Monday). This person was only slightly better than the first but also repeated that they could not cancel since they didn't see the order. What I questioned her on was on their policy of only being able to cancel an order PRIOR to their processing the order. Once they started processing, it cannot be cancelled (it can be returned but not S&H which was the whole point!). She said she would "try" to cancel. I called back on Wednesday and was told it was cancelled on Monday. I reminded them that I never got the e-mail cancellation so she did send one. The problem? It was for $30.29, not the $36.30 that I was billed. My credit card company has been notified of possible fradulent charges and I do have the printouts of the receipts.My only warning is not about the product but to be careful of where you order this product from.Product review updated 11/30/08:Since posting my original review, I have since purchased this item from a local retailer. I would rate it a solid three stars.....very average. I have 2 dogs and 1 tolerates it well while the other does not. I have followed all instructions that come with it. I don't think this is a good way to "clip" your dogs nails, I think it is more something to keep them trim and clean until they can be cut professionally which is something I will continue to do. One thing of note is that this device seems to work better without the plastic shield to capture the clippings. I can't really explain why but it is noticeable. I also seem to be unable to change the stars from 1 to 3. Sorry.By the way, to those who commented on my original review, this was my only "non-product review". I hope in the future, people can be more kind when commenting on reviews. It is one thing to give a 'not helpful' comment, it is another thing to call me names.</review>

<review id="6927">I bought this yogurt maker 2 1/2 years ago and used it regularly. However, when the recent BPA scare came out, I contacted the company to ask if it contains BPA. At first they did not respond to me at all. When I tried again, they sent me a ridiculous boilerplate message about how the US gov't does not see BPA as being dangerous. I would strongly recommend using a non-plastic yogurt maker (or at least one that doesn't contain BPA, as the chemical especially leaches into food when heated, and the whole point of a yogurt maker is to incubate the yogurt at the proper temperature) rather than risking exposing your family to more of this chemical than they have already gotten. It's upsetting to think I was doing something healthy for my sons by making them homemade yogurt instead of the storebought find, only to learn that they were exposed to extra bpa because of this maker. I am using the glass jar method now.</review>

<review id="6928">I purchased the Airport to replace an older Buffalo wireless router with the plan to incorporate centralized wireless USB printing through the router. As a wireless router it was easy to setup and provides a stable and strong signal to both my PC and Apple based laptops. As for wireless printing, it has been a long and ultimately unsuccessful process. My HP printer has always worked flawlessly through my Macbook/Leopard laptop with no need for fuss or frustration. The Airport Express apparently does not have the capability to work with printers like mine (HP 3845) even though the printer works fine when plugged directly into my MacBook's USB port. This was most definately not a case of "it just works". Given my expectations for centralized printing this has been a disappointing purchase. I am hoping future software/firmware updates from Apple will correct this problem and meet the standard "of it just works" for all printers currently supported by Leopard. In the meantime I will continue using this router for it's other excellent wireless capabilities.</review>

<review id="6929">I was so excited to get this product, and jumped right in, and basically before I realized it, my poor cat Joey, a purebred Abyssinian, was bald on his back. I had inadvertently pulled out ALL of the undercoat on his upper back. His regular hair was still there, but he looked like Joe Biden before his plugs were put in........I had also done some damage to my two other kitties as they wandered in out and out of the blitz. The FURminator does not hold the hair like a traditional brush, so there's hair EVERYWHERE.......it should be used outside but my kitties are indoor only so that is not going to happen. I think that if you take a couple of swipes a week that the product will do what it's supposed to do, but it's a mess to clean up. You have to be careful that you don't leave giant chunks of loose fur ON the cat--obviously the cat is going to lick it off and then your hairball problems will be even worse. So.........maybe this is a great thing for dogs that are in the middle of a giant molt, but for my kitties, not so much! I will have it around for the springtime shed, but will use it only sparingly and will have the vacuum cleaner at hand to clean up the mess.</review>

<review id="6930">I own four iPods, well 'we' do. I have two 4G disk based iPods and our daughter has a 16Gb Nano. I bought this 32Gb Touch for my other half... but despite the super high ratings and our long history with Apple we are not happy with the Touch.So what's the problem? iTunes. Neither of us has any like for the way iTunes organizes music. It took me years to fix the damage iTunes did to my music library, helpfulling filing all the collections by artist and thus scattering them across my hard drive. In retrospect I should have tossed all 60Gb and just started ripping the disks again. So I use WinAmp which manages both my music and my iPods perfectly well. Our daughter has always used iTunes, she knows no better, so she's thoroughly happy with her Nano despite the awful user interface. She used to just keep everything in one huge directory anyway, but then she has a great deal less music than me, a mere 13Gb.So what is the problem with the Touch? It does not support file transfer mechanisms. So despite having a 1TB network drive with an iTunes server on it the Touch can't see any of the music there. It needs the brain dead iTunes to access the library for it. But the Touch has a perfectly good 802.11 WiFi interface, it can even control the NAS drive through the web interface, but it can't touch the music there.The Touch also does not support USB Mass Storage, so WinAmp and other 3rd party iPod wrangling software can't do anything with it. Apple tightly control access to their interface specification and are not helping others provide support for their toy.Now the Touch can be hacked, unlocked and hijacked. There are third party tools that will get round Apple's decision to tie people to their software. I may try those options before I return this piece of high tech jewelry.</review>

<review id="6931">I purchased this hub to link to my Belkin 7-port hub for more USB ports, but I found that this USB hub will not detect my external powered Seagate hard-drive. My hard-drive works fine on my laptop and on my other hub, but not on the D-link hub. I would steer clear of this hub.</review>

<review id="6932">I imagine this would be good for some, but I don't much like it. First, the 'MFD' is really just a clock. Which has it's benefits in Flight Sim, but pretty limited, considering how much they tout it. I find it useful for traffic patterns, but not much else. The stick itself has some main flaws. The first being the spring is nowhere near stiff enough for the flight simmers. If you fly a combat game, and want fast reflexes, it's fine (other than the MASSIVE deadzone, which really, really sucks). The other main, and worst part, is the way the stick works. It uses a plastic ring on the base. This poses a problem, when you are trying to hold a slight nose down attitude, say on landing, and you try to aileron left or right, the nose begins to porpoise severly. I've tried everything from settings to a new, heavier spring, but the fact is, it's a design flaw. The more you pull on the stick, the faster the control surface will move. This presents a problem. If you pull back on the stick in a slow, continuous speed movement, and watch your elevators, they will move slowly at first, until they hit about 2/3, at which they will hit full stop with even the slightest movement rearward. This makes it almost impossible to perform smooth visual approaches. It's a nice stick if you're not really hardcore, and the throttle quad is really well designed.</review>

<review id="6933">I am very disappointed and will need to return. I thought the application was on a CD and it turned out to be a DVD which I can't use on my laptop.</review>

<review id="6934">The keyboard is good quality but, the blue backlight is very poor, at times it's very hard to see unless you are directly over the keys. The on-the-fly recording of macros is it's best feature. If I had kept the box I would return it for refund.</review>

<review id="6935">Be prepared for an aggrevating setup. It does seem to work as advertised, even the shareport. The LAN connection is very fast, I donot have my "n" WLAN card yet, so I cannot comment. I had to manually set the security key in Windows to get connected. I guess this maybe a windows issue, but my old zxytel must have done this on its own. Whatever. My blood pressure has returned to normal and the 655 has avoided the hammer, atleast for now.</review>

<review id="6936">Don't bother buying this product.  The first two seasons and Razor were great, but this season became disjointed and boring.  First, there is too much Lee and Starbuck.  Starbuck was initially my favorite character, but she is overused, and she and Lee have to just move on.  Second, Moore and Eick came up with great story lines that they just dropped.  For example, discrimination against the Sagitarons and the uniqueness of their culture, or the labor disputes and the desperate lives of people on the mining and farming ships.  GREAT episodes that were just dropped.  Moore and Eick seem to have a social sensibility, but they need to couple that with some sort of story arc.  Third, I think the viewer can learn more about the writer/producers from show that the viewer may care to.  All the "dawgs" are women.  None of the men are.  And the women are all hot.  That's great, but ALL of them? Couple that with the fact that four seasons in and there are still no gay and lesbian people (other than hot chicks with each other) on the ship, and I feel I know these guys.  There is no excuse for it.  And Eick worked on the under rated Bionic Woman, which had Isiah washington in its cast.  This exclusion seems to be at odds with Moore's clearly intelligent and progressive self.  Fourth, I personally thought the trial of Baltar dragged on, and Lee's involvment in such a high profile trial was foolish. But, Michael Hogan gave Emmy worthy performances, and I loved it when Laura Roslyn let loose on Baltar.  This season is a huge let down.  The show that gave us torture and stolen elections has turned into a soap opera with hot chicks naked with a man.  So, don'y waste your money.</review>

<review id="6937">I bought this router to establish a wireless network at home, under windows xp. I had a lot of troubles when i first installed in in my cousin's computer. Allegedly, there are compatibility problems with Mcafee products and this router. I bought this one because my uncle bought one a couple years ago and everything worked flawlessly. The in ternet speed was amazing and I did the installation in just a few minutes. They never reported any problems and they dont know anything about OS or networking. I had read about linksys reputation and being a cisco company I went and picked this one without a doubt, paying more than the average price of the competition (dlink, netgear or belkin). For my unpleasant surprise, i realized linksys had changed the operating system of the router for a much worse one. This is the reason of most bad reviews. This one, after version 5,included, has become an awful product. with lots of imcompatibily problems and in general a bad performance. The DHCP server doesnt work very well. If you use P2P programs to download from the internet your D/L speeds will be very low. You might find yourself losing connection without any reason or logical pattern, and it will result in long hours of frustrating efforts TRYING to solve the issues. If you want to stick to linksys for whatever reason, pick the one with linux compatibility and get some 3party firmware. Do not waste your money and time with this. Another good option (probably the best) is the Zyxel x-550.</review>

<review id="6938">The Monitor is easy to use but does not read correctly. I have checked the readings several times with different doctors because the readings are high enough to alarm me. The readings by the doctors say that my blood pressure is in the normal range.I am going to return this cuff as it of no use.</review>

<review id="6939">So I bought this thing and my cockapoo wouldn't touch it, I played with her with it and tried to show her how it worked and even rubbed cheese on it, but she never figured it out.  So I got the idea that I could take a empty 20 oz coke bottle and fill it half way with kibble and maybe she would graduate to the tug a jug eventually.  Well, she loves the plastic soda bottles, but still ignores this toy.  I think maybe it is because they replaced the rope with a rubber faux rope.  She loves her rope toys, but doesn't like this rubber rope.  I recommend starting with a soda bottle and only moving to this if they regularly destroy the soda bottle.</review>

<review id="6940">Final Draft 5 was great, and Final Draft 6 was spectacular.  Those two versions are what made Final Draft the industry standard in scriptwriting programs.Final Draft 7, on the other hand, is horrific.  Despite new updates coming out every month, the program constantly crashes.  The autosave function just seems to make it crash even more.  I can't count the hours of work I've lost to this highway-robbery of a scriptwriting program.  I find myself saving after every line of dialogue, which really breaks up the creative flow.Tech support is even worse.  After FD7 crashed for the umpteenth time, I emailed tech support asking them why the program kept crashing, and if there was a way I could recover my work.  I ended the email by saying, "Telling me it's because the program sucks isn't the correct answer."  I didn't swear, and THAT was the only insulting thing I said.I received an obscenity-laced response in return [...] and that they weren't going to answer my question.  Real nice.  [...]My hope is that Microsoft can incorporate a scriptwriting feature into the next version of MS Word.  I can't imagine it would be that difficult... the programs are already pretty similar.  Bill Gates loves to put people out of business -- here's his next opportunity!Until then, go with FD6.  It's not that different than FD7 -- the main difference being that FD6 doesn't crash every twenty minutes.</review>

<review id="6941">I have used this for years and it has never worked. Also it has not worked for my vet. He has two dogs and it will last a little over two weeks. It last from one to two weeks for me allso. She is a inside dog. When I started to use this and it did not last I called Frontline and I was told to use a larger size.</review>

<review id="6942">I've used the small round Oral B brushes for many years with no problems. The Dual Action / Dual Clean is another matter. It started out working alright, although like many others I found the brush head to be a bit too large. One day while brushing, the brush severely pinched my tongue causing it to bleed. Upon close inspection, the lower oblong brush seemed loose with a substantial gap between it and the brush housing. I suspect that over time friction wears away at the internal parts leading to looseness.I was not happy about the experience and sent the defective brush to Procter & Gamble for evaluation. I was quite surprised when they replied that no manufacturing defect was present, despite being informed of the loose lower brush. They could provide no explanation as to how the injury occurred and would not provide any contact information for me to escalate the issue. If this is P&G's attitude towards product safety, I will avoid purchasing any of their products in the future.</review>

<review id="6943">I gave this grinder two stars because the grinding part does work OK.  Getting the coffee grind cup out of the machine is the problem.  It just can't be done without the grinds going all over the counter.  I've had to put it in the sink when I remove the cup.  Look for another grinder, there's bound to be a better one.I purchased this one in early Nov 2007 and have used it alot and the mess has always been a problem!P.S. This is the only review that I have EVER wrote, so you can see that I feel strongly about this grinder.</review>

<review id="6944">I was very disappointed with the majority of this series which doesnt get interesting until the 4th book so if ou just want the backstory then trudge through this snorefest.</review>

<review id="6945">I would not recommend this upgrade to anybody that downloads transactions from their financial institutions. There appears to be a major bug (well documented in the Quicken user forums) which prevents downloaded transactions from matching entries currently in your registries. So far Quicken refuses to acknowledge this problem even though many, many customers are experiencing it. This bug creates a totally manual system of matching downloaded entries which greatly decreases the value of even having downloaded transactions to begin with. I have been a long time Quicken customer and user and this is by far the most bug prone release I have seen. I would switch back to Quicken 2008 in an instant because at least the core product worked there. If you thinking about buying this product I wouldn't. You will regret it just like me.</review>

<review id="6946">A very pretty pattern, but the material is much to thin.  The first time I  put it on the bed it ripped.

<review id="6949">I bought my router back in March. The first one I bought was determined to be defective.  This took almost 3 hours on the phone with customer support.  They told me to purchase a new one, or simply return the one I had purchased (easier said then done with Amazon!)My second router failed today.  I reset to default settings, attempted to reconnect router, would not let me go completly through set up.  Called NetGear, no matter which phone menu items I selected, paid support, free support, RMA for return authorization, BUZY SIGNAL.  This lasted all day.Next step, bought the exact model @ Costco, my luck, to replace the second defective router, maybe they fixed all these problems with V2 although my first two routers were V2, hooked it up in less then 5 minutes, mix of MAC and PC networks, NO PROBLEMS.Will return defective router to Costco and let them get a credit from NetGear.When the product works, it works well, but no customer support, and product life of 6 months??? This is my first and only review on Amazon, so I have to give NetGear, 1 star, a negative one at that.  Buyer beware, if you are going to purchase this, go to Costco, that way you can always get your money back when,not if your router dies!</review>

<review id="6950">The idea that we have to pay for state e-filing is a joke.  turbotax could use its clout to get that for free.  Forms are bloated and the state is not that well integrated with Federal so that you can have the entire tax summary at one time in one spot.  No 5 year history for State.  State is a very weak add on that looks like part of a no cost upgrade.  The idea that TTax wanted to charge per return is beyond greed.  We are buying a product, not a license. This is particularly troublesome as I help a friend who is near broke - I do it for no compensation.</review>

<review id="6951">Be sure you know what you're getting into when you buy this. One of the reasons I bought it - with a Netgear 54Mbps card - was the "3 year" warranty. Additionally, I thought how could I go wrong with a name brand? The router worked initially - until I applied the firmware update from Netgear. Unfortunately, the card didn't.Then, after applying the firmware update for the router, I got no response from it - wired or wireless. The correct lights came on making it look liked it was working. In order to return their products under warranty (after 90 days) you have to pay - either by the minute or a flat rate of something like $29.95 - to speak with their technical support personnel. I spent more than an hour and a half on the phone with tech. support - in India. We went through all the diagnosis tests I'd already ran to determine it wasn't working. They were polite enough but just going through bog standard diagnosis scripts.Then finally I get an RMA number, ship it back and get a new one. So far, this seems to be working. Though I have no real way of testing it because the PC card has stopped working - again. I daren't upgrade the firmware again in fear of rendering the router worthless - not that it's worth a whole lot now.</review>

<review id="6952">Specatacular views, but way too much footage of animals eating animals.  Every segment in the 5 disc collection keys into the fight for survival with preditors capturing and devouring their victims.  Whether slowly or quickly, this is bothersome.  I can not deny the reality and rules by which nature works, however, I was unprepared for the way BBC went there and stayed there time and time again.  Perhaps a better title for this series would be "Planet Preditor."  I bought this in hopes of sharing with my children.  Now, I wish I hadn't purchased it.</review>

<review id="6953">Why go all through all the trouble of purchasing this device when all its features are found on iPhone 3G? The trouble with iPod touch is that some applications only work with iPhone 3G. And being only 8, 16, or 32 gigabytes, it is not worth the price. There have been some alleged buzz on the blogosphere that Ipod touch audio quality is poor. True! I compared my classic iPod and the touch by importing the same song from a cd using the highest maximum rate of data transfer: 320 kbps and setting it to AAC (to avoid lossing too much data from the cd)and setting both iPods' EQ setting to "none". Guess what? The song still sounded "brassy" or "metal-like" on the touch. But the same song with the same data size sounded more cd-like on the classic. Try this yourself. I cannot understand this phenomenon. Perhaps, the touch still compresses data as it is synced from iTunes and the classic one preserves the size of the file. One more point I want to share is that the 2nd generation touch are not compatible with most dock systems. I bought a Bose portable docking system because it said on its advertisement that it is compatible with iPod touch. When the product arrived, I was infuriated to find out that it only works with the first-generation touch. My touch is 2nd-gen. Upon inquiry from stores and customers service hotlines, I found out that even Altec Lansing, etc are not compatible with the 2nd-gen touch. Maybe, that is why Bose has recently upgraded their non-portable docking system to accomodate this useless junk. But having tried docking my touch to a Bose non-portable docking system II in a near-by Apple Store (yes, they sell Bose docking system for your information), I could still hear a persistent and extremely annoying popping sound every 2 minutes on the speakers. The Apple Store personnel could not come up with an explanation!Imagine!Therefore, just buy a large-memory iPod classic 120G ($219.00) or an iPhone ($199).</review>

<review id="6954">I'm not sure I like this Flip video camera. I am used to a full-size JVC camcorder and bought this when my cam died after 8 years. I liked the portability and compactness of this Flip but it is very limited in what you can do. There is very little zoom power, and though there are pretty simple operating instructions, I find it hard to get the record mode going. The USB arm for transfering up to the computer is very convenient, one less wire to keep track of, but I am rarely spurred to use my camera. Maybe because the viewfinder is so tiny, and again, the difficulty turning on the record mode. Also, the volume is very very low on playback and does not get louder on the computer. I may be returning this if it's not too late. Would not recommend.</review>

<review id="6955">I used to use advantage on my two cats, and on my labrador retriver, and at first it worked very well, got rid of the flea problem quite efficiently. No wonder. This is because Advantage is a volatile poison and will kill pretty much anything - or anyone - who ingests it; pets, humans, and fleas alike.One day I used Advantage on my big, healthy, happy manx cat and was horrified to see him stumbling around, vomitting, and almost paralysed a couple of hours later. I had noticed that my dog had a reaction to it as well, she was acting listless and wouldn't eat (this is a dog who will eat ANYTHING!) but it was barely noticeable and so I just brushed it off and continued to dose my pets with Advantage. Then when my cat started vomitting and walking sideways I finally realized this product was poisoning my cat. I brought him to my vet who advised that Advantage was not a safe product, but that it "definitely gets rid of fleas". Yeah, well, maybe it kills fleas, but it also kills animals and humans. I would very definitely never use this product around children as it causes neurological problems and may make them very ill.Please, do yourself and your pets a favour and DON'T USE ADVANTAGE ON YOUR PETS or in your home. Now I use a pyrethrin based shampoo on my animals (now consisting of two cats and a rabbit now since my dog passed away several years ago) and it works wonderfully. Also, I should mention that pyrethrin is a natural product, it's derived from Crysanthemum flowers (pyrethrum species).. in fact, if you buy the right species of flower you can grow them on your windowsill and make your own homemade sprays and shampoos. Personally, I find it more convenient to buy it, but growing them yourself might be usefull for green thumbs out there.</review>

<review id="6956">This is a rotary tool, like a dremel, with a small sandpaper head that is supposed to file down nails. It didn't work on my dog (Sheltie). The dog was patient enough, but I was not. Do you think I want to sit there all day with a paw in my lap, waiting for this thing to grind down a toenail? I gave up long before the sandpaper wore out, but I just can't believe it would last very long. One thin little piece of sand paper against all those doggie nails, how long could it last?If I had thought about it, I might have tried my Dremel tool, but even that seems pretty silly. I just grabbed the good old clippers and had the nails off in two shakes of a puppy-dog's tail, or I should say about 30 seconds.Do you know what the worst part is? It's how stupid I felt, not only for buying this ridiculous product, but for actually sitting there for 10 minutes trying to make it work.If you want an As-Seen-On-TV product that actually works, try the Shoe Away Show Organizer.</review>

<review id="6957">My first experience with this mixer was in a video on bread baking. The instructor advised that to prepare the dough we should run this mixer for five minutes then turn it off to give the mixer a rest so the motor won't burn out. What?! Huh? Why on earth in this day and age should the motor of a $4-500 machine burn out with over five minutes of dough mixing? I looked around and decided (based on many experienced bread baker's reviews) that there are several better ways to go. These would be Electrolux Assistent, Bosch, and even Viking. Stripped plastic gears, burned out motors? No thanks, seems like the Kitchenaid is more about marketing than anything else.</review>

<review id="6958">The video quality is fine for sharing on the internet. However, sometimes the camcorder would shut itself off, usually right as I'm about to get a particularly good video of our baby:-( The killer, though, was that it works very inconsistently with our USB port. It didn't work at all on the front port, but it worked sometimes on the back. I would have to plug it in, unplug it, and re-plug it several times before I would get lucky and it would work. After reading several other people have issues like this, I gave up and sent it back for a refund. However, if it works for you, it was very easy and saving the video to your computer is easy. I really wish it had worked for me!</review>

<review id="6960">If it had continued to work, I would have loved it. But after downloading the first videos from it to my Apple Powerbook, the Flip Video stopped working. I followed the instructions for disconnecting it from the computer as it warned that if it wasn't disconnected properly, it could be corrupted, even if the incorrect disconnect occurred just once. But I did disconnect it according to directions. After which it would not turn on nor would the icon show up when I tried reconnecting it to the computer.I contacted their support who did respond within two hours. After a few emails over the next 24 hours, they wanted me to send it back for them to repair and recover the videos. But I already had saved the videos to my computer. And didn't like the fact that it failed so quickly. I only owned it for four days when it failed. And the support people didn't answer my questions. By then I had figured out that there are other inexpensive video cameras out there too and decided to shop for another.For their software to work, the camera is supposed to be connected to the computer. I don't understand that.It was so close to love! It is a fun gadget to use.</review>

<review id="6961">for the sake of your own health and life, do not take the full serving of this product if you are sensitive to things like this.....the odd thing is, is that it did NOT give me energy but it still gave me really bad shortness of breath and high blood pressureall symptoms ceased to exist once i discontinued use of this product....if you are using this to lose weight, you need to rethink why you are trying to lose weight....for looks...or for your health....for me it's a bit of both reasons, and i think it is for most...but just keep in mind that health is far more important than your appearance...keep working towards your goals and you will achieve them...but not if you have a stroke half way there taking this junk</review>

<review id="6962">I had this router working fine until I did an update on my systems, then they stopped communicating with it. I was able to restore one of the systems back before the update, so it works again, but the other is still off-line in XP (Linux works OK).This is a known bug in a lot of router software and I am upset that a firmware fix is still not available. I would have to recommend avoiding any products from this company.</review>

<review id="6963">Slumdog is not the original movie on India's infamous slums. That's Mira Nair's Salaam Bombay (Widescreen Special Edition)I won't go into the usual fawning that most articles give slumdog since this movie too fits into a pattern. That of the Westerner's obsession with India's squalor and poverty.To support my theory, go watch/read any of the following which have achieved acclaim in the West while not claiming those heights inside of India.    * The Apu Trilogy by Satyajit Ray    * Salaam Bombay (Widescreen Special Edition) by Mira Nair    * Shantaram by Gregory Roberts - English semi-fictional novel (parts of it use crazy English)    * The White Tiger: A Novel (Man Booker Prize) by Aravind Adiga, 2008 Booker Prize - English fiction novel (atrocious English)The white man feels a need to lift the wretched souls in his former colonies from the depravity of squalor into the white man's version of humanity...the so-called "White man's burden".The British crew led by Danny Boyle - although brilliant in its work - fall for the obvious depiction of India. For a more objective history of India, watch or read  The Story of India</review>

<review id="6964">I've only had the HJ-112 for six months.It became intermittant 2 weeks ago and now has stopped all together.It has been dropped twice, the belt clip doesn't really keep it secure.While the features and function are fine, I wish it would have lasted longer.  What can you expect for $20???</review>

<review id="6965">VERY DISSAPPOINTED AND AGGRAVATED! I Spent $40 for this, and there were several problems - First of all, there is an additional fee to e-file, annoying, but whatever. But then NOT ALL STATES ARE AVAILABLE TO FILE WITH THIS PROGRAM. PENNSYLVANIA IS NOT COVERED!!! But they don't tell you that on the box or in the information!(I Purchased in a store)If they didn't have my state I could have purchased a cheap $17 program or done my federal return online for FREE. Second, you only get ONE state return with your purchase, and additional returns are $35! So even though I live at home with my husband, we would each need to spend we would need to spend 75$ to file to state tax retuns?!?! (if we could even file them...)And if you worked in two states like alot of people that commute between NJ and NY or Pa, they are going to charge you $75 each to! Why?! What the heck did I spend $40 for?! For this much money I could have gone to an actual person to do my taxes, who would get me more deductions anyway. Also, had a hard time declaring business expense kept giving me a false error message. NOT WORTH THE AGGRAVATION or MONEY! Try a different program or go to a tax place.</review>

<review id="6966">The various PC's, my Macbook, and Wii all connect to this router fine and work well. I never get dropped.  I do have a problem with the keyword filtering. This router has a feature the is suppose to allow you to enter keywords to block access to websites containing the keywords. This feature is supposed to work with keywords found in the URL or within the page content.  Even with the keywords entered and features activated, I'm still able to get to many sites containing the banned keywords. It seems to detect when the keyword is part of the URL, but not the page content.  Too bad.  One of the reasons I purchased this router was for the parental control feature.  If you don't need these feature, this is a great wireless router.</review>

<review id="6967">I thought this product sounded like a good idea.  Fresh water for the cats through a filter.  It was hard to clean, hard to fill, and the cats kept going to the other water bowl.  Better idea was to give them a clean bowl of fresh filtered water each day, much easier.</review>

<review id="6968">I like the nice glass look and some of the new features, but overall it is not a product I would use. I've used various versions of Office for Windows, OpenOffice.org, and Office 2004/2008 for Mac, as well as iWork 06 and iWork 08. I prefer iWork 08 the best, and while Office 2008 is pretty nice, there are some issues I have with it which keep it from being my product of choice.*Performance: Office programs typically take a few seconds longer to open than iWork programs do. It takes up more ram and makes the whole computer run more slowly than an iWork program does.*Cost: What is Microsoft thinking? Charging hundreds of dollars for productivity programs (depending on the version), when OpenOffice.org (however ugly-looking and special-feature-lacking it is) is free, and when iWork, a superior product, is well under a hundred dollars.*Size: The size of all the programs and files in Office 2008 Home & Student is over 900 mb, bigger than it needs to be. iWork+iCal+Mail is less than 700 mb. And Office also has tons of visible files in the Office folder, all of which are executable and pose potential security risks.*Compatibility: Here's a funny one. I opened a Word document I made in Office 2003 (for Windows, .doc format) in both Pages (from iWork) and Word (from Office). The formatting (paragraph size, margins, etc.) was nearly identical to the original when viewed in Pages, but when viewed in Word 2008, formatting was different! This isn't always the case, though. There was a document I made in Office 2007 (.docx) and formatting was closer to the original when viewed in Office 2008 than when viewed in Pages. But still, Microsoft made Office 2003 and Office 2008, and you'd think they would know how to keep formatting the same better than Apple.*A bad copy. True to Microsoft's past, they just copied features found in iWork 08 and mushed them into Office 2008, only they didn't do a good job. Like 3D slide transitions really look 3D in Keynote, but they are almost a joke in Office. Or the thing in PowerPoint to help position graphics: it doesn't work with as many items as it does in Keynote. Or controlling PowerPoint with the Apple Remote doesn't work as well, and you can't start a presentation with the remote either.*Not intuitive. Toolbars are a thing of the past, and you have to keep a side window open for formatting and such. However, if you're viewing the formatting for, say, a chart, you will have no access to basic font formatting at that time.</review>

<review id="6969">I bought this in good conscience after reading some positive reviews, at the time. I wish I had waited. Go read the reviews now, nine months after the fact. I've been to several sites and many people are having the same problem. The drive crashes and all your data is toast. It will make a chirping/growling noise, and your computer will not recognize it. So, after trying to make sure my data was safe after a harddrive crashed in my brand new laptop, I was stupid enough not to retrieve ALL saved data from the external, and now all that was not saved is gone forever. I give up. Is there no product that is problem free???So if you value the data you put on this SimpletonDrive, make sure you also back up somewhere else, because one day you'll turn it on and it will all be gone....</review>

<review id="6970">My fiance and I registered for this blender after reading the near-universal praise on Amazon. We make smoothies often, and I also use a blender to puree soups. I couldn't wait to try this one, which seemed like it was going to make blending a breeze. Unfortunately, this machine is SO LOUD that it doesn't even matter how powerful it is. We couldn't even stand to keep it running for fear of killing our ear cells. You know how when you pass a jackhammer in the street, you have to cover your ears really well, just to be able to stand walking by? The noise was almost to that level. Truly deafening. I decided that I would have to put ear plugs in if I ever wanted to use this blender again, so we sent it back. And the one smoothie we tried to make? Even that was a disappointment. The blade had a very hard time cutting through the frozen fruit (even though we had plenty of milk and fresh fruit in the mix). I have never felt the need to write a review on Amazon until now, but this experience was so jarring (no pun intended) that I felt I should warn others.</review>

<review id="6971">I LOVED this little player... so much that I tried three times to get one that would work for more than three weeks. They freeze on the start up screen, and there is NOTHING you can do to fix it. I enjoyed this player because it held roughly 500 songs, used one triple A battery, and was very easy to operate. Wonderful, lightweight, compact, and good sound... that being said, it could clean my house and balance my checkbook, but if it doesn't work it is essentially useless. Keep your packaging and receipt... and enjoy... cautiously.I had a friend who had to send hers back twice.</review>

<review id="6972">I chose to buy the NetGear router because it was about $10 cheaper than LinkSys, plus it got a great review from CNET. I was disappointed with the router, though. The connection drops to a really low speed all the time, and the farthest I've ever used it is about 30 feet with two walls of separation. Also, when my friend came over with his laptop, he was unable to even connect to my network because he uses .11b instead of .11g. Be warned, if you plan on using b and g simultaneously, this router is definitely not for you. In conclusion, I would recommend paying more for the brand that more people trust: LinkSys.Happy hunting!</review>

<review id="6973">I dont know know the cause and there is little in the way of debug tools to find out. Waste of money. DONT BUY ONE!

<review id="6974">The software does not install on a 64 bit system.  What a disappointment to read all of the literature, purchase the product, and learn this from a pop up window at the beginning of the installation process.

<review id="6975">My experience with this router has been less than pleasing, to say the least.I used the router rather happily, without issues, for a few weeks. Then one day my internet connection went down, and when it came back up I couldn't get my computer to connect to the router. Even sitting litterly right next to the router, I would get an error message, stating "There was an error attempting to connect to NETGEAR". After hours of troubleshooting, I finally got it working again. But that success was short lived. Now it seems like just about every day, I inexplicably lose connection to the router, despite being only about ten feet away from it. Then, half the time when I try to reconnect, I get an error message. What's more, there are times where I supposedly AM connected to the router, but the Internet doesn't work, despite my connection being intact. Then I have to play around with disconnecting from the router and then trying to connect again, often without success, and to the point of driving me insane.To be fair, the router does have its strong points. The password protection is definately a plus. I'm glad not to have to worry about other people using the connection. Still, I don't think that this router is worth the trouble you have to go through just to get it to do what it's supposed to do. I'm sure that there are plenty of better password protected routers out there. Get one of those.</review>

<review id="6977">My two year old daughter has been sucking the middle two fingers of her left hand since just hours after her birth. To avoid future embarassment for her and high orthodontia bills for me, I bought Mavala Stop to coat her fingers. The first night, my daughter DID keep the treated fingers out of her mouth.  The next night, I found her sucking those fingers. The third night, after my daughter's bath, I coated her fingers again.  Before the Mavala had even dried, she was licking her fingers like they were popsicles! So, it may be a great product for successful results with other customers, but Mavala Stop is not for us.</review>

<review id="6980">Sorry if the title is a little strong but I have been using word processing and spreadsheet software since the 70s and this is a great leap backwards. I do not know what caused MS to abandon the simple pull down menus and control and alt functions that let word approach 60% of the efficiency of word perfect. The new programs are cumbersome, mouse intensive and trash for the serious user .  If you need a new computer you are better off with a used computer with the prior generations of this software. It is not just my opinion but that of my grad students. It is incredible that Microsoft had the arrogance to put this product in the marketplace. A great boon to Apple and if MS removes support for XP as scheduled it is time to BUY Apple stock.   My guess is that market demand will require support for the older versions for many more years. Hopefully with more European influence MS will fully support universal document formats so that users will have a real choice.  We use both Word 97 and WP in the office. Most of our new people are unable to believe that there is anything other than Word, but after using wP for a while come to prefer that for its easier and more predictable results and far easier to use command structure. Given their choice WP wins for internal documents even though they need to use Word for many external documents.</review>

<review id="6981">The new office, 07', is sleek, versatile, and visually stimulating. However, my experience with the software as a student has yielded much inefficiency for my productivity. Compatibility between 07' and 03' has been my problem. I  expected all compatibility problems to be solved or transparent when this software became available. However, I have had significant disasters sharing my 07' documents with professors who use their University's staple office 03'.I have recently learned you must manually manipulate the 07' file you are saving to be compatible with previous editions (97' and 03'). Again, without warning from the installation of 07', I have had significant problems between my 07' files saved at home and the 03' versions at my University. I'm sure some training on compatibility for all students and university members would ease the process. Therefore, I don't recommend the conversion from 03' to 07' yet until your University has upgraded too.</review>

<review id="6982">This router is the worst product Linksys has ever put on the market.  Whatever you do don't try to use a PC and an Apple on the same wireless network, they don't have the software to cover that.  Don't try to call them either, you will be on the phone for a couple of hours before they try to blame the problem on your ISP because they (the customer reps) are incapable of doing anything but following the checklist.  I spent over a week trying to get the router configured and all I had to show for it was a sore ear and a pad full of useless notes.  I got a different answer for the same question from each representative that I spoke with.  Do yourself a favor and look into another router.  We ended up going with a Westell wireless router and have had no problems (straight from the box).  I cannot think of one nice thing to say about this router... Okay I guess the color is nice.</review>

<review id="6983">I've bought close to a dozen of the earlier versions of these routers over the past few years as well as recommended them to my friends, and the ability to update and upgrade the flash memory with modified open source software is the reason why these routers deserve a wonderful reputation. The modified software versions, such as HyperWRT and OpenWRT, Sveasoft, etc. have over the years provided capabilities that Linksys themselves didn't put in the box on their own, such as having routers that link up over the wireless connection, or routers that can work well in P2P applications with hundreds of active connections. Some of these features made it back into Linksys's official codebase over the years, helping to make this  a Truly Great Product. Linksys has chosen to eviscerate the memory of the latest version (v5) of this product to make this version cheaper. This latest version doesn't have Linux inside and as others have reported isn't nearly as stable as earlier versions, nor is it in any condition to have the open source community help Linksys fix the problems. If you want The Little Blue Box That Could, you now have to buy the WRT54GL, which Amazon now carries for about 70 bucks.</review>

<review id="6984">This review is from: Slumdog Millionaire [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)      I wanted to like this film. I like Danny Boyle. I'm of Indian extraction. But wow. It's just a bad film. I agree with D. Bhansali's 2-star review in large part. Slumdog really isn't about India or even poor people. It's about the transformative of power cinematic illusions. But so what?**spoiler alert**To see how manipulative this film is consider the following question: how would the film have been different if Jamal's mother did not die? Answer: the only consequence is that he would not have known the answer to a game show question.I'm not joking. That is the only discernable difference. Jamal's mother is beaten to death in a pogrom and this influences Jamal's psyche in no apparent way. Later in the film, Jamal's girlfriend (Latika) is raped by Jamal's brother. Again, Latika seems to suffer no ill effects from this sexual assault.How are the children of the slums able to overcome such trauma? What is their source of inner strength? We never find out because Slumdog makes it very clear that the events it depicts are mere plot devices. They don't represent real events. The mother really didn't die; the girl really wasn't raped. It's all fake. It's just a movi about a game show. There will be Bollywood ending--complete with a little Bollywood dance--just in case you had any doubts about the complete unreality of what you just saw. Memories of children being orphaned, mutilated, sexually assaulted and sold into slavery are all erased in the blinding light of Latika's model-perfect (but entirely vacant) smile. Hey, that's cool. Why not? After all, it's just a movie.This sort of nonsense comes off rather badly when compared to the brilliant film Salaam Bombay! The street kids in Salaam Bombay! face the same tragidies the kids in Slumdog face. But Salaam Bombay! demonstrates that these stark circumstances are bearable because the children of the slums have individual worth. The urchins speak and have real motivations (compare this to Latika or the one-eyed urchin). The children of Salaam Bombay! survive their suffering because they create dignity within that suffering. At no time does Salaam Bombay suggest that the main character's suffering is illusory or can be easily forgotten if he can just find a beautiful Bollywood girlfriend.I don't deny that Slumdog is at times enjoyable. It's reasonably well acted and entertaining. But that is part of the problem. In view of films like City of God and Salaam Bombay!, I think we can and aim a bit higher and demand more than just entertainment.</review>

<review id="6985">It is an "oops".  Seems I didn't research enough to know it doesn't have it's own backup program embedded.

<review id="6986">Would such a precious secret really be revealed for $35?Why would something so IMPORTANT just be handed out to everyone. ...You know the answer to that.I have been exposed to many "new age" and "spiritual" views. I have been a seeker of truth all of my life. My friends showed me The Secret one evening and it seemed very important for them to show it to me. I can see why they did. At first, even past much of the cheesiness, I loved it. I even bought it. Then after a few days reality hit me. Something was not right about it. They were leaving important things out, like accountability. The whole focus is on creating whatever you want for your own selfish fulfillment. Well how about the fact of what you want affecting others? The approach is so narcissistic. I don't remember much talk of helping others at all in The Secret. The whole video is about Self fulfillment. I'm sorry but there is already TOO MUCH of that going on the world. Especially here in the good ol' United States. Our addiction to things and money is ruining us.. isn't it obvious?It is a wonderful dream to think that you can CREATE your own reality the way you want it. It is a wonderful fairy tale land that you could get lost in. It is not happiness though. It is not what anyone REALLY wants. It just can seem like it is.They talk about being tired of getting bills in the mail. You should start visualizing money instead of bills. And the money WILL come.Say what?! If you have bills, you brought them into your life by creating that debt. You can "expect" to get money in your mailbox all you want. What about your own accountability of the bills you have. The video talks about bills like they are just a result of your "scarcity" thinking. No accountability. Strictly self fulfillment. This video shows quotes from great people of history, such as Einstein, Martin Luther King, and Mother Teresa. I wish they were alive today to speak about the selfish views of this video.There are bits of truth in this video, don't get me wrong, otherwise it wouldn't be so popular. The main message of self fulfillment and absence of accountability is disturbing. It is clever, but I am glad I saw through it.</review>

<review id="6988">I don't know what it is about this recent batch that I received.  They seem old--drier than usual.  And even when I spritz extra water on, they just don't seem to clean well at all.  I can not get rid of a strong urine smell, for example, and cleaning after a soiled diaper is particularly frustrating.  I see little advantage of these over a wet rag.  The only good thing about them is that I will not have to grumble about them for long.  I seem to be using at least 2-3 times as many wipes, trying to get bottoms clean.

<review id="6993">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      A sequel? There really is a Satan. Meyer has proven to be one of the most annoying and somnambulistic of writers.

I suppose in book three Bella will finally give up the big prize and "go all the way" with a zombie, which is pretty much all that will be left of Meyer's fan base. Honestly the woman's purile writing induces narcolepsy!

<review id="6994">pros; small, cute, good price (at first glance)cons; horrendous pics; both still and motion. resolution is dismal. how anyone could say it ws near dvd quality astounds me-as one reviewer stated. the audio is virtually useless, and diminishes from near zero to sero as the distance from the mike increases-at 10 feet youo hear almost nothing-recording a band playing would leave you very frustrated and disappointed. it also sucked up my batteries like a kid with an ice cream cone-thankfully for those that can be recahrged. a person sitting on a floral sofa had the flowers in focus but not them, they were totally fuzzy and blurred under both web quality and high quality..moving the camera to get the person in focus still had them VERY fuzzy-hard to look at without the eyes getting sore/tired from seeing such a blurry pic.i only bought this when the price dropped to eighty...mistake, it is hardly worth it at even thirty, and then it's just be something to keep in the glove compartment in case of an accident/emergency. i knew this camcorder would notgive great pics, but certainly the low quality surprises me, how low will you go in quality...i will send this back and spend a little more.addendum: took it to a club; horrible, you can barely make out the faces of the performers, either in WQ or HQ; grainy pics, and the video made the people moves like they were jerky, not normal movements of human beings. then i took it outdoors and filmed; again horrible detail. in WQ you could not make out rocks on the ground, a rosemary plants was very blurry as to be near not reconizeable...in HQ there was not much difference either. and the sound from the band at the club was distorted and sounded as if it came from a turntable at the wrong speed...and to hear the music i had to turn up the tv to full volumne and even then is was middling in hearing levels.this camera i would never use even at thirty, the pics, shown to anyone would be embarassing.</review>

<review id="6999">Never buy this product! I bought mine from a certain online store. At first the camera works fine, true to its word it has a high definition video. I kept it in a special place, I even put some moisture absorber (dehumidifier) beside it to avoid the camera from getting moist. In other words I gave it a special treatment. But then, one day for no reason, it just won't operate. When I open the LCD, it's totally DEAD!! I know the problem is not in the battery because I test it using a multi tester. It's (the problem) in the video camera itself. When I tried contacting the support, he keeps redirecting me to another website, one was chinese and the other one is german which the latter don't offer support for this specific model. If you are a person who likes to be sure of what you are buying then this video camera is not for you. But if you are a person who has a "gambling" kind of attitude, then you may try this stupid camera. For me, Aiptek is just trying to look sophisticated so as to get a big profit from the market. Talk about durability and support??? PWEEH!!!! I will never buy Aiptek products again. I've learned my lesson the hard way. A single star for this stupid product.</review>

I guess most of the book seemed like a cop-out. The only thing that redeemed the book for me was the section that Jacob narrated. He is so much more interesting than Bella.</review>

<review id="7002">The Seller maybe "NEW" to Amazon as the reference states_BUT I think the Seller needs to check prices prior to posting_maybe reading the post or something rather.Or could this be an investment we need to know about OR the peak cost of GASOLINE per 1 quart_oops!_per 1 gallon??Good luck new seller on your great bargain basement priced items.</review>

<review id="7003">I have had this drive and am extremely dissatisfied with it. It performs far slower than my old Lexar JumpDrive which is only USB 1.1. I have read the Cruzer titanium is the fastest on the market. Well, after owning the Cruzer micro I can say it must be the slowest on the market.I have tried every type of file system when I format it. I have tried to optimize for performance. And I have tried to copy files large and small. No matter what I do I cannot speed up this drive.It does get 1 star though for being so small and having a cool blue light when it is plugged in.</review>

<review id="7004">This was a Christmas gift for my 15 year old daughter. The purpose was for her school homework. Only three weeks on use and already broke! She is a very responsible students her old computer lasted more than 4 years and was used. The screen is so small that only a teen will find it useful.</review>

<review id="7005">After hearing many raves about Sonicare, about a year ago I buckled down and bought an Essence 5300. I'd been using a manual toothbrush and due to my aggressive brushing habits that caused me to get a gum graft on one of my upper molars, I decided to switch to a sonic toothbrush b/c of the supposed benefits. My dental history before this had been excellent and I exercise proper dental hygiene. I'm in the 2% of the population who have "virgin" teeth... no cavities, no braces, good coloration and no wisdom teeth. I went in for a routine cleaning 6 months ago and experienced the only excruciatingly painful cleaning I've had in my life. I have a pretty high tolerance for pain yet I found myself needing numbing cream and laughing gas to get me through it which is ridiculous. My dentist told me that I had heavy calculus build up and it required using a vibrating scrapping stick to get it off. My gums and teeth were sore for days after this cleaning. It was awful and I couldn't figure out why my teeth were so bad.After mentioning that I'd been using a Sonicare, he immediately told me to get rid of it and get an Oral B Vitality (only $20.00 versus the $80.00 I paid for this brush). In essence my dentist mentioned that Sonicare was a marketing ploy and was nothing more than an ineffective, expensive toothbrush. The way that the Sonicare is structured, it's very difficult to clean the back of your teeth, your back molars... basically all of the hard to reach areas. The vibrating horizontal motion of the toothbrush is not nearly as effective in cleaning as a brush that rotates in a circular motion. My dentist has only recommended one patient to use Sonicare and it was b/c their teeth/gums were super, ultra sensitive. After this visit I literally walked right into Walgreens 2 blocks away from the office and picked up an Oral B Vitality.Recently I went to get my routine cleaning and my teeth were excellent (now that I'm not using a Sonicare). My dentist hardly needed to do any scraping and the visit was very pleasant. I definitely would not recommend this toothbrush to anyone... save your money and get a Vitality.</review>

<review id="7006">The first one from amazon, the door would not open. The internal opening mechenisim was broken. Sent it back to amazon, what a pain. Got a new one. It worked for a week, but not well. Weak power, strange noises.Then just stopped working. Too late to return to amazon. Must find a repair place, none very local. Don't buy things like this from amazon, buy from a local dept. store with a good return policy. Also, stay away from sharp. the old ones were great, new stuff is not...</review>

<review id="7007">I bought this kettle to replace my 10+ year old kettle, which had problems with its power cable. I liked the design of the Breville and the stationary base concept and believed in most reviews saying that this is a stainless steel kettle. However, it is not. The entire lid is pure plastic and there are other plastic components inside the container (including the slick-idea blue LED holder), which invariably will give you plastic leaching and organic trace compounds for many months to years. What made me return this kettle for a refund, however, was not just the plastic, but also the fact that the stainless steel bottom developed significant spots after the very first load of water, one of which was dark and would have developed a rust pit rather quickly. If that wasn't enough, the lid mechanism only worked every other or third time (you push a button to pop the lid open). This mechanism cannot be disabled or worked-around. I tried many times to see if it gets better after many moves, but it didn't.All in all a very disappointing implementation and craftsmanship. I fixed the cable of my old, truly all-stainless kettle and will continue to plug/unplug it every time. At least I know that works...</review>

<review id="7008">I hope Kurt Russel doesn't sue me for that title.I decided to take the leap into pod brewing systems with this as I received a gift certificate to help with this purchase along with several other discounts. I think I went out of pocket $90 and I still feel cheated.The basic problem is that there are not enough grounds in the pods- even the pod that allows you to add your own grounds. Instead of K-Cups they should have said K-Scoops as the amount of coffee in the pods is FAR too miniscule to have much flavor impact on the water. I ran with the recommended Dark Magic and Sumatra "Extra Bold" blends, but even they fell way short. I tried to make this work for about a month and then gave up on it.If you're looking for a cool blue night light that makes instant hot water from a pressurized resevoir (PV=nRT) then this might be for you. If you're looking for strong coffee look elsewhere. If you like coffee-flavored water then this is probably for you.I'm actually brewing manually with a funnel (my organic chemistry Bodum glass vessel broke- I think I've broken EVERY piece of Bodum glass I've ever owned), a gold cone filter (left over from the $50 Bodum MDC- Manual Drip Coffee-maker), and a Thermos 12 oz stainless steel cup (The Holy Grail of coffee cups, which reminds me...I need to buy another pair of these gems).This all started with my "voluntary" recall of the 8 cup Starbucks Barista brewer. If I had it to do over again I would NEVER have turned in the Barista. It made great coffee ALL the time and I could overbrew if I wanted to and have coffee soup. Stupid is as stupid does. I think I'm going to buy a Black and Decker Smart Brew and just make 1 cup at a time (like I do now) so I don't have to try and find another thermal maker as I haven't found one yet that hasn't been panned in the reviews.</review>

<review id="7009">I would like to review TT 2008 but I'd have to see it first.  My problem is that the file won't open.  I used TT 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007 on this machine with no problems.  I expected the same when I downloaded 2008, but no such luck.  The installation went right to the end then stopped with an error message.  I tried downloading a second and third time with the same result--it woudn't open.  After waiting 30+ minutes on hold, a technician told me that they were having "issues" with TT 2008 and no the cd version wouldn't work either.  He finally gave me a refund and said that they would email me if they could find a fix for this problem.  Tax Cut here I come!</review>

<review id="7010">The keypad is unreliable. It often registers only about 2/3 of the keys pressed, and at best still misses a key here and there. The included USB cable must be used to ensure proper performance, which of course defeats the purpose of buying a wireless device. The range varies each time I tried to use it, sometimes it would work a few feet away (the 3.3 ft. range claimed by Targus), but often it had to be within 12 inches of the receiver to work. I actually purchased 2 of these Stow-N-Go keypads and had the exact same problems with both. I give it two stars, not one, because under the perfect conditions it worked all right and for that brief time it was nice to have a wireless device. I'm returning these for a refund.</review>

<review id="7011">We used these in our Vicks 1 Gallon Cool-Mist Humidifer, and each time I replaced the filter it would only last 2-3 weeks.  These filters are a little pricey, so the maintenance cost for the humidifier quickly added up.We kept the humidifier running 24 hours a day in my sons nursery so that it was always on and ready to go when he went down for naps and bedtime.  Maybe if you didn't run the humidifer for such long periods the filters would last longer.</review>

<review id="7012">When I was pregnant and shopping for the nursery, I was torn between what type of bumper to buy. One one hand I liked the softness of the Carter's brand bumper, but I liked the "breathable" bumper because my daughter was born in the beginning of summer and I wanted her to stay as cool as possible; so I bought the breathable bumper. When I put it on the crib, it looked very nice and while my daughter was little and imobile, it was very useful. As soon as she began to roll around, about 4 months, I would wake in the night to screams...her litttle arms and legs would get caught in the spacing of the crib, up and over the bumper! She would roll and turn while sleeping and apparently her limbs would lift over the bumper and the bumper would crumble under the light pressure of a babies arm. I have since bought the Carter's brand bumper and I am happy. It stands up to her limbs and no more limbs get caught. Great idea, but bumper needs work.</review>

<review id="7017">I've gone through two of them. The first one had the dreaded "setup timeout" problem which numerous other people have reported on the Linksys forums where neither IE or FF will allow you to login and go through the setup without significant timeouts. Next one I had wouldn't connect via the wireless, even with an hour and change worth of time with Linksys. They finally offered to ship me one directly from their warehouse. Told them forget it. This has now been replaced with the 610N model (after just a few months) which has more RAM. If you're worried about the lack of antennas on the 610N don't be - you weren't getting much from the NONREPLACEABLE antennas on the 600N. What junk and "style over substance" that Linksys is going with now. I even looked at D-Link but their dual N gigabit router is going for a lot more money for now, if you can find it. But it DOES have 3 replaceable antennas. If you need/want dual radios, the 610N is the cheapest route to go at present. But don't buy this dud. It's got a limited lifespan for support too.</review>

<review id="7018">The manufacturer instructs on the label of the product that "Results may occur at 2 months" sounds like "don't be surprised if there are none". It has discouraged me from using the product.</review>

<review id="7019">Lasted all of three weeks before failing completely. Even when it did work, I wasn't impressed- there's no software to organize your music and the user interface (i.e. the buttons on the player) is mediocre and unintuitive.

<review id="7020">In case there wasn't enough evidence in the world at large regarding Microsoft's failure to do ANYTHING right, Office 2008 for Mac is just one more solid example of the ineptitude and lack of anything resembling intelligence in Redmond Washington.First of all, I have three macs and one PC, bought three licenses of this alleged 'upgrade' and have since uninstalled them and replaced them with Office 2004.One mac is a iMac G5 with maxed out everything and it ran painfully slow. The other two are Intel based macs with 4GB of RAM and 256MB of Video RAM and to my surprise it loaded twice as long as Office 2004. This is not a random occurrence, every time on both computers it takes nearly 40 seconds just to load. My four year old PC loads Word in about .5 seconds.Forget using the notebook layout. The interface is awful and the only way you can switch between levels is by setting your margins in 'Print Preview'. As a law student I am constantly outlining and the fact that I have to do my outlining in 'Print Preview' mode is just ridiculous. Office 2004 did the job just fine by hitting the 'Tab' button.I know there are those of you who actually studied software programming who will argue that I don't understand anything about how the software works. You can even convince me that Office 2008 is faster and more stable etc... But as someone who spends about 12 hours a day in Word I can say this product really really, ridiculously sucks.I find myself saving every time I type a period because the software is so unstable. One second you're typing, the next you are faced with a twirling umbrella for four minutes. Sometimes it just flat out crashes on you. Then you enter 'Recovery Mode'.... enough said.Finally, why does Microsoft insist on making nothing backwards compatible. By that I mean why not stick with .doc? Why did Microsoft have to go out and invent something called .docx? Now when I E-Mail my work as attachments to friends, I have to convert it to .doc before sending it. I don't care what advantages .docx has, the fact is, Microsoft simply wants everyone to upgrade. As a business savvy individual, I can understand that, but wouldn't you rather make something that is easy to use and reliable?Just like I downgraded my PC from Vista to XP I am downgrading back to Office 2004.</review>

<review id="7021">I loved loved loved this lil guy for the first 6 weeks!!!  I got the XP version. It connected easily to wireless networks, the camera works fine, I loaded Office 2007 and Photoshop Elements without a problem, and it even substituted for my desktop at work for a week when my co had mega-problems with Vista activation (don't ask). When I first got it, it held a charge fine for a couple of hours. Then this morning, it stopped charging at all. Worse, it won't even turn on for more than a few seconds before it dies, even when it's plugged in. I'm guessing it's a defective battery. Now I have to get hold of Acer's customer service. I tried their website and they sent back an email that I have to call a 1-800 number and "because the call volume is high, you may have to wait a while." I haven't tried yet, will probably give it a shot early tomorrow morning. Yeesh. VERY aggravating.</review>

<review id="7026">I bought this software hoping to it would help me get control of my income and expenses. After countless hours learning how to use quicken, enter my data, and set up accounts, what I realized was this tracks cash flow, and cash flow is very different from income and expenses (if you buy a car with cash, does that mean that for that month you had one huge expense? and just see what happens when you process returns through this software). I checked with my office accountants and discovered that they all use excel at home. Now I do, too. Much simpler, more logical and a more efficient way to record income and expenses. Only buy quicken if you have hours to kill tracking every last pencil eraser purchase and are in love with reams of useless information. If you want to do your budget, use excel or even just a piece of paper.</review>

<review id="7027">I've had the freezing bowl in the freezer at home for 3 straight days and the liquid inside is still "liquid". I then put it inside another freezer elsewhere where the door isn't opened so often as in the one I have at home. Voila! It worked, usually in less than 24 hours (freezing time recommended by instruction manual) it was ready for use.One time I was preparing an important dinner for guests and I had my ice cream base ready but the bowls (which had been placed to freeze 2 days before) were still liquid inside.  Lucky for me, there was an ice cream place nearby and I asked them to prepare my ice cream in their machine. They saved me.So bottom line is, unless your freezer door is not opened frequently, the freezer bowl will be ready in a wiz, otherwise, prepare to wait at least a few days before you can make your ice cream.</review>

<review id="7030">When this router's working it's great, but that's only half the time for me. I purchased this router over six months ago, and ever since I've had many problems with the connection dropping on several laptops in the house. I've updated the firmware, replaced the router with a newer one, and called tech support several times. They admitted a problem with some routers routinely dropping connections, and said for some there's no fix at this point. They said a future firmward upgrade could fix the problem, but couldn't guarantee it. Until I can get more consistent coverage, I can only give this router 1 star.</review>

<review id="7031">This appliance has several good features, but they are outweighted by the fact that it does not produce a decent piece of toast.  At the lowest setting one side of the toast comes out too brown, the other side barely toasted.  The inner side of the bread toasts faster than the outer side. We did manage to get a decent piece of toast by inserting the bread, setting a timer for 1 minute, pressing cancel, reversing the bread, and slowly counting to thirty before pressing cancel again.  Far too much work!</review>

<review id="7032">I loved the idea of this litter box, and perhaps the smaller boxes work better, but the large size is more trouble than scooping ever was. Litter falls out from the seams when the box is rolled and gets all over the floor and the side and top of the box. The latches that secure the top to the bottom seem very fragile. My cat's clumps are sometimes too large to pull out of the hole where the collection scoop fits in, making it difficult or impossible to remove the clump in the way intended. Also, even though the box inself is very large, because of the design, the actual space for the cat to occupy is fairly small. I'm planning to take the top off and just use the base as a regular litter box. I don't recommend the large box for the price.</review>

<review id="7038">This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)      I am usually a big fan of Ben Stiller.  Loved Meet the Parents, Dodgeball, even Envy was not that bad.  But this movie tried to do too much.  And Ben Stiller's style of comedy is starting to wear thin (kind of like Will Farrell's).  He should try something different.  And I'm not talking about something along the lines of Simple Jack.  I think maybe he should have a chat with Jim Carey about what to do next.  Robert Downey Jr did his best to try to keep this one going, but even he wasn't good enough to save this turkey.</review>

<review id="7041">This review is from: Slumdog Millionaire [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)      I'm sure this looks great on Blu-ray and all, but the movie is awful. Be an individual, think for yourself. These pity votes for horrible movies that portray lives which we as a judgmental and undiscerning public consider lesser than our own need to stop. Crash was a bad movie, this is a bad movie. These are bad films, don't watch them. Please. There is so much good cinema in this world. The new batman wowed everyone, and I found no one to be aw-struck by this film. Benjamin Button was great. There are so many good movies with credible reviews naming them as such. An award show can make a lot of money for a movie, but that doesn't mean it's good.</review>

<review id="7042">I received this as a Christmas present.  As we were heating it up to use it for the first time, we noticed a plastic sort of smell.  The instruction manual said this was normal.  Well, within a few more minutes, the griddler plates began to melt and come apart.  The smoke and heat damage melted the knobs on the front.  In total, the unit had been heating up for 10 minutes, initially on high and then placed on low.  The smell in the house was awful.  The fire department and fire chief came out to the house, it was a disaster.  Luckily nothing caught fire and no one was hurt.  The worst part was the smell that we could not get rid of. We even called in a company for odor removal.  Customer service/risk management were not very helpful or nice.  They actually offered to send a replacement unit!  As if I would want another!  It was not an easy process to resolve!  Please find something safer.</review>

<review id="7043">I owned this for about a year. It work great but constant use took its toll.  Last week I tried to use it and the motor wouldn't turn.  Investigation showed that vibration in the engine had caused it to break two of its 4 mounting points.  These are just simple screws into very thin plastic.  Thus one of the grinding wheels was touching the internal casing.  It must have been coming loose for a while as the vibration had bent the shaft slightly which means the whole thing runs out of balance.  So into the garbage with it</review>

<review id="7048">Yes, the color is beautiful and rich.  And yes, they wash well.  But these are going into the trash because they are about as soft as cardboard.

<review id="7050">John Adams the biography is one of the great history books of all time. This mini-series does the book, John Adams, and the viewer great injustice. Overacting is the lightest offense. Anyone who has read much of Adams' own words will have a difficult time seeing him in this series. However those who know anything HBO has done, will have no difficulty discerning their fingerprints on this series. Partial male frontal nudity in the first episode (a man's clothes are torn from him while he is tarred and feathered). The second episode (dis) graces us with Franklin talking about castration and men's 'stones'.What would have been an entertaining and educational series, reflective of Adam's own values, has been corrupted and poorly executed. That McCullough has allowed his name to be associated with it is quite dissappointing.The much older John Adams series, while less professionally polished, shines far more brightly.</review>

<review id="7051">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      I felt like this movie was so terribly disjointed, I can't really even put my criticism of it into a good structure.  I thought the product placement was rampant and distracting, the romantic relationship was cringe worthy, and the whole plot was overstuffed with chinzty stressors and visual excitement.Product placement comes first.  I don't have any problem with subtle product placement that does not dominate the script.  For example, if the protagonist is going to be using his computer often then why not approach Dell to see if they'd like their brand name on the monitor?  As my wife and I deconstructed this movie last night in bed, we found a lot of useless scenes that only seemed to exist to provide an opportunity for product placement.  Somebody eats a whole plate of donuts in a situation where they you wouldn't expect donuts, we're given 15 seconds of explanation as to why the donuts are there, and then shortly after the character has prominently consumed some Pepto-Bismal.  Did the analyst have to sneak the data out of the Pentagon for the soul purpose of placing emphasis on a Panasonic SD card?  Is the protagonist wheeling and dealing just to explain the plot's emphasis on Ebay?  Never mind GM's sponsorship of the movie.I could only just barely stand the romantic relationship.  For starters, the female lead was entirely oversexed, especially for a high schooler.  Some time was wasted in the beginning of the movie with Bumblebee playing Herbie the Love Bug incognito.  The sexual tension was ratcheted up a bit when the male lead got the female lead to sit on his lap "for safety's sake"; the back had no seat belts and she refused to sit in the driver's seat while the car was driving itself.  Then one of the autobots identified that the boy wanted to "mate with the girl".  The barometer just keeps on rising with nary an innocent kiss, until, at the conclusion of the movie, the two appear to be priming themselves to 'continue the circle of life' atop their new best friend, Bumblebee, while the Autobots and the men in black watch on.Finally there was all the overdone stress and excitement that, for some reason, Bay felt necessary to achieve his golden 143 minute run time.  Why did the female lead order the secret cop to strip?  Apparently just to reveal his funny underwear.  Why did the male lead take his 'do anything' badge?  Beats me.  Generally in a movie when you make a big deal about acquiring a cop's badge and clothes you use them to advance the plot.  I guess including a hilariously obnoxious obese black computer genius is comedy gold in Hollywood, but mightn't we expect him to be worked into the plot?  And the fights had just too many cuts, zooms, and jiggles.  I suspect that this is because, once the studios had constructed their CGI monstrosities, nobody could figure out how to make them fight excitingly.  The answer of course was to zoom, cut, and 'hand cam' like mad.  That added plenty of visual excitement, but it made the fights pretty hard to follow.In conclusion, the best part of this movie was Tom Lenk.</review>

<review id="7052">This is the weakest of the three books.  I don't understand how Edward can even LIKE Bella.  All she does is mutter, moan, grumble and get in the way.  She really must smell intoxicating to Edward; otherwise, I don't see the attraction.</review>

<review id="7053">The first three books were so superior to this last one. Too much going on and the ending is silly.</review>

<review id="7054">The series should have ended with Eclipse. I am deeply disappointed with this ending and this book in all. The vampire-human pregnancy (um, birth control anyone? SHE IS 18!) and wedding, the whole blood-drinking during pregnancy, the Jacob imprinting saga and the happily ever after. This was a horrible ending to a fantastic series.</review>

<review id="7055">I recently bought this flash drive for $20 (on sale from $50) because I thought it was a good deal.  But even at $20, it seems too cheap for that price.  It is made from all plastic and feels very flimsy.  I imagine that the slide mechanism for the USB port will fail in under a year.  It comes with U3, which can be easily uninstalled through the built-in U3 program.  My biggest gripe, though, is the orange light, that constantly dims on and off.  My USB ports are all on the side of my laptop and the dimming is distracting.  I haven't been able to find a way to disable it either, so I cannot leave the drive plugged in and work at the same time.  Although the price was good, I regret having both this.</review>

<review id="7056">I am a pet sitter and just wanted to remind people that if this ball has only one hole in it, a dog biting down on it can create a vacuum and the dog's tongue can get sucked in and the dog will not be able to pull the ball off.  I have seen a heartbreaking case of a large dog that's tongue got sucked into the ball and before anyone noticed, the tissue had died and the dog's tongue had to be amputated.  Please be sure this ball has at least two openings in the boy before giving it to your pet.  Make sure there is no vacuum created if the one hole is stopped up.

<review id="7058">DOES NOT FIT IF ARM IS VERY BIG. CAN NOT USE ON LARGE ARMED PERSON,WILL NOT GIVE TRUE READING</review>

<review id="7059">MANY SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!The moment the first blonde `joke' came I knew this book could not redeem itself. Stephenie Meyer's well-documented gigantic chip on her shoulder about blonde women has always irked me - I mean, the one time she has a blonde character she makes her a self-absorbed, nasty piece of work who is more like a caricature than a real person.Right from the outset - despite my love of the story - I had some reservations about the Twilight series. And now Breaking Dawn seems to have done irreparable damage to my overall enjoyment of the story.It also confirmed for me what I had been thinking all along: the books would have been better had they been narrated by Edward (though they would not have been able to make the same massive first impression on young girls - the money makers for this franchise).As with films, your leading character in a book has to take some initiative and achieve some things on their own. The `Hero's Journey' rules are applied to screenwriting, and they would have done well to be applied to the Twilight series. Making Edward the primary character would have strengthened the stories.Take Harry Potter, for example. He has plenty of friends and allies who help him along the way. But the stories are successful because always at some point Harry has to `take up the sword' and make things happen for himself.It's the same with any saga. The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, The Matrix.Bella fails in much of the series because she is always engulfed by the secondary characters. Twilight, for example, would have been more satisfying if she had done just one thing to help herself, instead of having her knight in shining armour always turn up at the last minute. She is practically redundant in Eclipse, really only having to worry about which boy she likes best. I accept Stephenie Meyer's explanation that - of course - Bella was no match for the vampires, but it would have been far more satisfying to occasionally do something to help herself.In the past I could overlook this because the story was just so intoxicating. It was a `guilty pleasure' read, a wonderful romance where the girl gets swept off her feet by a gorgeous superhero (and then, for some reason, spends a bit of time in love with a schoolboy)....Breaking Dawn was Bella's moment to shine. I understand Meyer did not want a battle at the end, and that she cited not wanting to kill off the characters. But - with Bella's newfound abilities - this could have been the moment all the books were leading up to: the moment Bella saved the day.But no, the only shining Bella did in this book was when she was standing in the sunlight, once again thinking about her own perfection (and sex). It's like she's become Rosalie, but somehow it's okay for her to be insufferably vain because she's Bella....And, by the way, where is the interest in keeping everybody unharmed?!?! Four books that led to what?? Everybody back where they started on page one of Twilight?!?!Really not much has changed, and nothing has been sacrificed. That's not a good tale, that's kiddie fan fiction.Bella's still got her human family, still got her vampires, still got the guy she's obsessed with. The only difference now is that she's going to have a lot longer to exist without changing.The imprinting thing is just plain creepy.So, in a few years, the Loch Ness Monster is going to look like a woman. But she'll have the mental age of a second grader. And everybody is fine with a child entering into a relationship with Jacob - essentially making him a paedophile?!?!And speaking of the Monster, what a massive disappointment. Meyer writes her women as being obsessed with babies, so while the baby storyline was unwelcome, I found it incredibly predictable.But - after all the flesh-ripping, bone-breaking horror of the pregnancy and birth, I had at least hoped we would get an interesting child out of it all. But no, apart from the horrendous name(s), the child is just `perfect'.As is the rule in television, babies are great in real life, but they are the easiest and best way to kill a good story.Charlie finding out (or not finding out) was completely unnecessary. More disturbing was how badly it was all handled. I mean, he just doesn't seem to care!! And then he goes to watch football with Emmett?!?!The keeping of Bella's mother out of the story was just plain lazy writing.The absence of any description of Bella and Edward's honeymoon was just strange. After all the talk, all of Edward's learning control so that they could be together, we get a fade to black?! And then another and another and another fade to black?I would not have wanted to read pages of sex scenes, but the complete avoidance of the issue was a major miscalculation. And saying it is because it is a Young Adult novel is no excuse. Young Adult Fiction tackles sex all the time. From Judy Blume to John Marsden, Young Adult writers recognise the importance of addressing sex in their writing.[...]And excuse me, but it is suddenly quite okay to devote a third of a book to Bella's body literally being ripped to shreds, and yet we cannot hear about the relationship of our two main characters?!?![...]After this book - between the blonde `jokes' and the references to picturing Bella naked, and the imprinting on an infant(!!!!) - Jacob can never be redeemed for me. He is my least favourite character now.Meyer seemed to forget how young these characters are (I mean the humans). As ridiculous and disturbing as it was to have Edward trying to pimp his wife out to Jacob, it was even more ridiculous to have these teenagers standing around contemplating babies. Why would someone as young as Jacob even be thinking in this way?!I have always had issues with feeble, weepy Bella, but she was insufferable after her transformation. People have always commented that we never saw Bella's true self because she was narrating the stories and was hyper-critical of herself. But suddenly she's a vampire, and all she can do is walk around thinking about how astoundingly beautiful and strong and elegant and great she is. She painfully vain, and extremely difficult to like.As I said before, for all Meyer's painting of Rosalie as a vain woman, once Bella becomes a vampire she spends so much time admiring her `beautiful' reflection, or her `amazing' skills.And if that wasn't bad enough, she's become a sex maniac!! The only time she has anything to do with her husband she's either begging him for sex, or actually having furniture-breaking sex with him (that we never actually hear about, of course). That's about the entire extent of their relationship in Breaking Dawn.And all those erroneous characters. Oh boy. What was she thinking?! There is absolutely no point to any of them. All those confusing names and backstories and pages and pages of introductions. Why?!?! Where did the focus of the story go? Why remove wonderful characters like Alice and Jasper, just so you've got time to introduce us to ten trillion characters who are going to stand around doing absolutely nothing, and then leave??It was like reading a child's story - they invent all these cool superheroes, and then get bored and just give up on writing any interesting adventures for them. I honestly cannot believe that the editor allowed this to stay in the text. I believe if this was Stephenie's first book they would either have insisted she cut it all out, or - more likely - they would not have a published such a messy manuscript full stop.All this unnecessary character introduction (and all that werewolf stuff that was completely irrelevant to the heart of the Twilight story) really sank the book beyond redemption. I was BORED. Additionally, I don't care how well-written it is, you don't write three and a third books from the perspective of one character, and then suddenly switch to someone else for no particular reason. We get to the most significant time in Bella's life, and what do we do? We leave her head and enter the mind of a character who really had no reason whatsoever to be there through the pregnancy, birth and transformation.It was just another thing that contributed to the messiness of the final book.As I said, I am a fan of the original story, but I am having a huge time coming to terms with the disturbing and just plain bizarre direction the Twilight books have gone in. From Romeo and Juliet to mutant vampire babies ripping our Juliet's body to shreds. I'm just so utterly amazed that an author could so completely lose the plot - seriously, just, WOW....</review>

<review id="7062">This Omron HR-100C product worked perfectly for about a month, then became eratic and now is useless except as an ugly, oversized wristwatch.  It reports heart rates from 70 to 210 during medium exertion which should read about 130.  Tried new batteries - no improvement.  Tried different positions.  Sweaty or dry.  Holding the watch close to the transmitter doesn't improve it.  This unit has only been used by one person, indoors, never in water, never dropped.I never had these problems with cheap heart rate monitors before.  In reading other reviews, the failure to read valid rates seems to be a common problem with this product.  Rather than deal with Omron repair hassles, I'm just discarding mine.  I do like other Omron products, but I won't be buying anything like this from them again.</review>

<review id="7063">My Linksys wireless router went bad in five months (mid-December). That's what I was told by their tech support. (They were wrong on that one, because I wouldn't be able to write this review right now if it were so.)I found tech support and customer service an exercise in exasperation:One told me to go on the internet to request a new router. He couldn't explain how I could do that if the wireless router was bad.Another one told me she could take the request by phone. That seemed easier.They promised a replacement by the first week of January. It has yet to arrive.Their customer service apologized but the warehouse was closed from December 8th to the 27th. (Okay, that happens.)Second call to customer service was disconnected. There were frequent disconnections with tech support too.Third call to customer service never answered. There were no prompts like: "There's a two minute wait" or "There are three customers ahead of you" or "Thank you for your patience; please continue to hold." The only way that I knew I was still connected was that I saw the minutes and seconds moving in the phone window. After 11 minutes, I hung up. Last Sunday it took one hour to get someone to tell me that Customer Service wasn't answering. I had to call Tech Support. A supervisor verified that Customer Service phones weren't working.Fourth call, I was put on hold by the representative for eight minutes. Then, he told me that my order was being held up because there was a hurricane in the Pacific. (Can't they fly around it, I chirruped.)Another rep told me that I would have to get a new replacement number. Turns out, I didn't need one.Still another told me the shipment was delayed because they were moving their warehouse.Still another told me that my replacement was on back order, and he could not give me any time frame for delivery.You must provide a credit care for replacement or for tardy return of the old router that has gone kaflooey.They get one star because they are polite, and their English is comprehensible.UPDATE: Feb. 6, 2007. Discovered that Linksys charged my credit card $84.52 for router not received after seven weeks. It took 17+ minutes to connect to Customer Service, and another 15 minutes to get the transaction cancelled, and assurance that my card would be credited. They said, "two days."UPDATE: March 20, 2007. Linksys attempted delivery of the router after cancelling February 6th. It arrived one quarter of a year after my original complaint."Let the Buyer Really Beware!"</review>

<review id="7064">I have clearwire, and I only get a strong signal in one area of the house, so I figured getting a wireless router was a no brainer. After spending about 4 hours trying to set it up, the linksys router login page reset over and over, and the internet wouldn't work for more than 11 seconds. After resetting to factory defaults it still stopped working. I had a bad experience with this product, I hope you do not, but just know that if you plan on doing advance settings you may have problems.</review>

<review id="7071">I love SciFi and I loved the old series, but this reincarnation is extremely bland. I often cannot even tell that I am watching SciFi . There are episodes where every civilian is wearing a necktie and a suit, as if this was taking place on Earth!StarBuck drives around in a Hummer, American street signs, an absolute lack of any type of advanced technology. Give me a break- why would everybody dress exactly the way we do? Most scenes that take place on a planet,look exactly like they are taking place on Earth. There is nothing alien about the surroundings at all. They never show an extra moon in the sky or alien life, etc. This series shows absolutely none of the attention to detail that made Star Trek a classic sci-fi series. Its has none of the exotic feel that I look for in sci-fi. The Cylons appear as totally human looking and act like humans- there is nothing spooky, unusual or mystifying about them at all- what is the point of that? In fact, one of the main Cylons is a cute Asian girl, who may as well have on The Apprentice or the OC, she seems and acts totally normal! Adama speaks in a constant mumbling monotone and shows absolutely no emotion ever. The President is played by a whiny neurotic woman who has absolutely no "presence" when compared to other actors who have played Presidents on other shows. The Battlestar Galactica is a dreary worn out ugly ship, with absolutely no indication itpossesses any advanced technology. They speak to one another with big blocky old style wired telephones! Wouldn't a starship have at least cellular phone technology?? The list can go on & on. The Balter gimmick is silly- he is constantly talking to a beautiful Cylon women only he can see. Again, the same problem- what is Cylon about her? She is just another ordinary annoying woman- there is nothing alien about her! Also, how about an explanation of how the Cylons came to be & how they became independent- there is no history with respect to this at all.</review>

<review id="7073">I purchased an older model, new from Petsafe and it requires CR 2032 batteries.  It is very inefficient.  They put small batteries in the collar that require them to be changed often.  A cost of $4.50 to change the batteries every few weeks makes the PetSafe collars far too expensive to operate.  They should have put rechargeable AA or AAA batteries in the collar instead.  I will never buy one again.  Now, it's time to buy again and it looks like they are still using batteries that are too small.</review>

<review id="7074">After 2 hours of trying to set up the unit and establish the boundary, we gave up.  We would get the collar to beep at a one location, then go back to the same location and it wouldn't beep.  We changed the position of the transmitter, changed the battery in the collar, reset the transmitter - all  futile.  We even had the transmitter sitting out in the middle of the driveway (no cars around) with direct line-of-site to the collar and it was not consistently able to beep at the boundary.  No way I would trust this for my dog's safety, not to mention confusing the heck out of her.  And to top it off, I bought it from a place (not here on Amazon) that is going to charge me a 20% restocking fee.</review>

<review id="7078">I got HBO to watch 'True Blood' because I liked the books so much.  I canceled my HBO subscription at the end of the season.  I only kept it as long as I did because I could not get enough of Alexander Skarsgard, who plays Eric.  ( He was also fantastic in 'Generation Kill'. )  He and Pam are what got the 2 stars.  The personalities of most of the characters are changed from the books, and mostly not for the better.  Sookie, the main character of the books, has been warped into a bi-polar nightmare by the writers and mostly over-acted by Paquin. Important parts of the vampire mythology from the books have been left out and instead we get the "V" story line and the illogical "tribunal".  Some great moments from the books are in the show but without the "glue" that tied them together the story often seems schizophrenic.</review>

<review id="7079">This product is beyond useless for me. Despite Amazon's claims in the product description that Quicken Starter Edition 2009 tracks 401k accounts and loans, IT DOES NOT.Quicken Starter Edition 2009 can ONLY track checking/savings/credit card/cash accounts. It cannot track loans of any kind (personal, home, vehicle) or any type of retirement account. I thought about entering my home loan as a credit card account and manually adjusting it every month, but I'd rather have a software program that works properly. Apparently Quicken Deluxe can handle loan and retirement accounts, and I would have ordered it from the start if I had realized Amazon had a completely inaccurate description for the Starter edition. However, I think now I'm going back to my tried and true Microsoft Money just because of this headache (I also have a problem with Quicken "talking" with my credit union, and never had that issue with MS Money).</review>

<review id="7081">I have held off evaluating Office 2007 in the six months since our tech department installed it, hoping that I would eventually catch on to the new interface.  It hasn't happened.  The ribbon is a radical reorganization of functions that is unintuitive, takes up more screen acreage, and forces me to navigate between dozens of infrequently used options in search of those few commands that represent 80%+ of my clicks.   The once intuitive correspondence between menus and keystrokes is gone.  I am having a hard time finding any real added functionality over previous versions.  Worse, there is a very real loss of functionality for those who developed idiosyncratic pop-up menus, toolbars, and macros, which have been rendered unaccessible or less convenient.  The Quick Access Toolbar is a cumbersome and nettlesome substitution.  The applications take longer to launch and are buggier in their interactions with other applications, including across Office applications (e.g., difficulty opening Excel files from Outlook attachments).  I always allocate a few days of degraded productivity when upgrading ("upgrading") software, but the grace period for transition is long past.  The tech department re-installed Office 2003 two weeks ago.  I regard it an upgrade.</review>

<review id="7082">I have bought and returned two of these in the past 8 months or so. The chopper barely worked from the start every time, and the whisk was pretty feeble and inconvenient to use, but I put up with those because the hand blender part was useful... the short time it lasted. The plastic teeth in the mechanism that makes it rotate get burned or deformed in some way, and it stops spinning all of a sudden. This can take a few weeks or months (I used mine quite a lot), but is definitely not worth it for the price (especially with the completely useless chopper and whisk attachments). I gave it 2 chances, and ended up returning it both times (to BB&B), so I am definitely not buying it again and would NOT recommend it to anyone.</review>

<review id="7084">Over the course of film history, both in the United States and abroad, numerous films have been made which relate, in some way, directly or indirectly, to some aspect of the Holocaust, among the darkest periods of any century and of human existence. They include those that have a popularity that transcend the subgenre and rise to become classics in a general sense: "Exodus," "Sophie's Choice," "Schindler's List." Many of them involve the young in some way but there's a body of work that focus chiefly on young victims who find themselves caught in some aspect of the genocide. This decade alone has seen more than a few such films, whether they are Jewish children who are forced to endure unspeakable barbarism ("Fateless") or young-adult Germans with the courage to take a stand against the atrocities of their leaders ("Sophie Scholl: the Final Days")."The Boy in the Striped Pajamas" is the latest such movie to premiere. From the United Kingdom, it is directed by Mark Herman from a screenplay Herman wrote, basing it on a novel by John Boyne. The story, experienced mostly from the perspective of children, concerns a lonely eight-year-old boy, Bruno (Asa Butterfield) newly relocated to the German countryside from Berlin, who befriends another boy his same age, Shmuel (Jack Scanlon). They like each other, find they have much in common, and want to play with each other every day. But they're separated by a tall barbed wire fence that courses with electricity. After all, despite their similarities, there is one irreconcilable difference: Shmuel is a Jew and that fence hems him into the grim concentration camp to which he and his family have been sent. Bruno, meanwhile, maintains his freedom with a family headed by his father, a captain who moved them to the country when he was promoted. His new job: run the concentration camp. Visible on a distant horizon from Bruno's new room, the "farm," as the child initially mistakes it for, is tended to by numerous "farmers" who wear the titular "striped pajamas" (really, uniforms with numbers); Shmuel is but one of hundreds of them.A large part of the story, generally filmed by cinematographer Benoit Delhomme in muted tones, with especially drab grays for the camp and its workers, concerns Bruno's gradual discovery of the senseless hatred people can harbor against one another for no good reason. Unlike his older sister, Gretel (Amber Beattie), he is relatively slow to absorb the lessons of the tutor his father hired, lessons that purport to justify why his father's work is for the benefit of their country. Bruno, by his own admission an "explorer," much prefers to read his fantasy and adventure books over the anti-Semitic tomb of a book his teacher assigns him to read. Another concern of the movie is the infuriating class differences inherent in such systems, as, for example, the monstrous treatment imposed on the Jewish Pavel (David Hayman), formerly a doctor, now a worker in the camp and servant in Bruno's well-to-do household.But perhaps the most important concern of the story is naivet? Not simply childhood naivet?but the childlike version in adults. It is this that is not only one of the most interesting aspects of the picture, but its most problematic. It manifests itself here in Bruno's initial perception of the "farm" and the workers in their striped PJs, which is one thing. More sadly, but less believably, it also is reflected in the fact that the depth of the systemic hatred and lack of humanity in Bruno's father (David Thewlis), not to mention the dark details of his new job, barely register at first with Bruno's mother (Vera Farmiga), an innocent, then concerned, then indignant woman with some shreds of humanity that she fails to act upon until she sees her children become too exposed to the cruel philosophies and actions of their father and his henchmen.As the story progresses, the level of ignorance of the two boys at its center regarding the circumstances that envelop them becomes less and less plausible, especially considering that they each witness and experience some of the abuse of the soldiers first-hand. Late into the film, Bruno has seen some of the rougher side of his father, yet, when asked by Shmuel if he is proud of his father, Bruno responds in the affirmative with seemingly a minimum of hesitation. Further, Bruno seems to have little if any doubts about his family, even in the face of his sister's rapidly increasing phobia, militancy, and hatred. Most profoundly, despite the fact that Shmuel himself toils in the camp, he does not even come close to suspecting that the explanations he is given about his and his parents' predicament, why he was transported there, and why people in the compound keep mysteriously disappearing may be weak attempts to mask something that is wrong. It's nearly impossible to accept that, when he realizes his own father is missing, he starts searching the camp for him, oblivious to the notion, despite where he is, that he may have been murdered. It isn't until the final, waning minutes in the film, when the boys--Bruno especially, but to an extent even Shmuel--begin to better comprehend the wickedness of the camp. These may be kids, but I doubt real children in similar circumstances would be as clueless as the film assumes they would be, no matter at which side of the fence the sit.The basic conceit of the film is certainly engaging and there are many scenes that are memorable for their drama, tension, and horror, but, in its realization, the filmmakers attribute so much permanence to childhood innocence that much of the story's credibility is undermined. They assume that such innocence can continue to survive, will not erode, even under circumstances as difficult and raw as these.</review>

<review id="7085">I bought this shaver because (a) Consumer Reports designated it as a Best Buy (b) my own positive experience with the Remington CleanXchange and (c) the low price.  Unfortunately, while the MS2-390 does deliver a close shave for me, it appears that the build quality of this model is suspect.  The low battery light came on after just the 3rd shave and I began to notice small facial nicks after each shave, something I had never seen this from the CleanXChange and Braun foil shavers I also own.  I know at least a couple of the other reviewers on Amazon have noted the same things happening with their shavers, so it's just not me having these issues.  One gentleman on another forum has had Remington replace his shaver TWICE trying to get rid of the low battery light problem!  It appears as if getting a reliable MS2-390 is just the luck of the draw right now.  I have e-mailed Remington customer service about my concerns and will update my review if/when I receive a response.UPDATE: I received a replacment shaver from Remington Customer Service.  However, I experienced the same issues as with the first model and have discontinued using the MS2-390.</review>

<review id="7086">Where do I begin?I am currently college student and I consider myself to be extremely computer literate. I purchased this router less than a month ago and have been on the verge of wanting to strangle Linksys ever since.The plan was for our apartment to be set up completely wirelessly. I have 3 roomates with laptops, and I myself am on a desktop. They all purchased Linksys wireless G network adaptors and I purchased a Linksys WET11 wireless B external ethernet adaptor (I was weary of the poor Linksys G adaptor reviews). Initially everything appeared to be working great. I literally just plugged my WET11 into my computer and it began receiving the signal from the router. After the adaptor installation on the laptops, my roomates were connected likewise.Then I changed the SSID, and hid the broadcast. Immediately we ran into problems on the laptops. On 2 of them it took a good 10 minutes for them to connect up with the hidden SSID, and on the 3rd one it would simply connect for about 5 seconds and then disconnect. Extremely frustrating. A few days later I began have connection problems on all the systems.To make a long, tedious story short, they all ended up returning their network adaptors, buying CAT5 cable, and plugging their laptops directly into the back of the router. Being as my computer and desk are a good 30-40 feet from the router with no forseeable way to run a wire to it, I have remained wireless. To maintain "better" connectivity I've had to broadcast the SSID and turn off WEP (so long protection). And to say the connectivity I get with this thing is pathetic would be a gross understatement.For no apparent reason the router will stop broadcasting. Then it will start again for a minute. Then it will stop. Then it will start again for a minute. Then it will stop for 5. Then I will walk over to it with a hammer and it will start broadcasting again. Then it will work for 10 hours. Then it won't work for 5 hours. Then it will give me IP conflicts. Then I will set up static IPs. Then it will give me IP conflicts. Then it will stop. Then it will start again without IP conflicts. Then it will run fine for the rest of the day. Then maybe that night it will start going on and off again. Then I will begin to roll up into a ball and cry. AND ALL THIS TIME IT GOES ABOUT 3-10x SLOWER THAN A HARDWIRE.I have no cordless phone. I have no possible forms of interference. I have the router in an open area with line of site to my adaptor. Countless hours of tweaking, repositioning, reseting, and firware upgrades have yielded no permanent fix. Linksys tech support? hahahahahahahahahahahaha  This product is a disgrace. Please, anyone reading this... STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM LINKSYS WIRELESS PRODUCTS AS POSSIBLE. You have been warned.</review>

<review id="7087">Office 2007 is nearly unusable.  All the useful commands are spread out over mutiple ribbons making every task a challenge.  There is no customizablity at all.  You are stuck using the ribbons exactly as Microsoft created them.  It is plain that they are so arrogant that they think they know what you need more then you do.  They have also filled the software with frilly useless features that have no place in the professional world.  They make it nearly impossible to create macros and if you do succeded at making one you can't place on any of the ribbons.  This is without a dought the worst version the company has ever produced.  It is quite clear the negative effect of no competion.  Don't upgrade until you have absolutely no choice.  The headache is not worth it.  For every improvement in this program there are 10 negatives.</review>

<review id="7095">TurboTax, honey, you and I go way back -- I think we hooked up back in the 80's, didn't we? You were just a kid then, simple, unsophisticated, but to me you were a fine piece of work and I  fell for you, hard.  And you've been doing nothing but getting better ever since.  Can I ever forget  all those nights we spent together, how you massaged my deductions, depreciated my assets, and played along with all my off-beat alternative tax games?  I loved you, honey, and I thought you loved me too, but I guess I was wrong. It wasn't me you wanted. I see that now.  I should have gotten the message when you made me buy Delux just to get you to do my C's and D's the way I liked it, but I guess I just didn't want to know the truth.  But now that you want me to go with your "Business" version to get you to do those things for me, I gotta face facts.  You're just too high maintenance for me, sweetie.  I've been a fool for you, but it's over now.  I'm seeing someone else.  I'm seeing TaxCut.  I know it will take a while to get used to her style, but she's a cheap date and she's straight with me, doesn't try to stick me with hidden fees, and she's grateful for the chance to do my C's and D's without getting all uppity on me.  I'm going to miss you, honey, but nothing lasts forever.  Look, uh, I gotta go, TaxCut's out in the car waiting for me.  See you around, kid.</review>

<review id="7096">Writing a novel-length review of everything I hated about this book would just be redundant, so check out all of the one-star reviews for that. I just have to say a few things:-I found the pregnancy plot line to be extremely contrived. How are people calling this "out of the box" thinking? I can just picture SM sitting at a desk wondering how to get the Volturi mad at the Cullens and then saying, "Er... I guess if Bella gets pregnant...?"-The romance in these "romance" books has really gone downhill. Remember the meadow scene in Twilight? When Edward kissed her before the baseball game? These scenes were so magical.-There is no magic! It was so present in the first and second books, it lingered in the third book, and it left before this book even started.-That was the most anticlimactic ending I've ever read. After about 600 pages of pregnancy woes, when I just wanted a little bit of action, SM dangled the string in front of me and drew it back a second later. Thanks.Still, Jacob's book and Bella's becoming a vampire redeemed the rest, if only a little. And as much as I really want to burn this book in a symbolic show of my passionate hatred for it, I was entertained for a few days, and that's something. A thought for the author, though: Maybe Stephenie Meyer would serve the world of literature better as a ghost writer? She's a good writer and all, but her content's a bit... off.</review>

<review id="7097">I bought this coffee maker even though I had read a lot about how it just did not make good coffee. I bought it to match some stainless that I had and because the pot itself did not feel flimsy. BUT!!! No matter what you do (add extra coffee, buy a more expensive brand, try an espresso grind) there is NOTHING you can do to improve the flavour. Another reviewer had stated that she thought that it was the pattern of the water as it flows over the coffee and I think she must be right. So if you like your brew tasting watery all the time, and you don't appreciate a rich full-bodies cup of java, then this Cuisinart is the brand for you.</review>

<review id="7098">The first arrived with a water leak over the control panel and it was returned. The second works, but there's nothing special about it. Other machines keep the coffee hot as well and are not so difficult to open. The plastic is cheap too and you have to turn the machine to see water level and controls. I don't need an extra plastic piece to keep the coffee hot. Even using a gold platted filter (not gold tone) and freshly ground beans the results are the same as my reliable Braun. It's being returned to the vendor.</review>

<review id="7099">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      When i read this book i was very disappointed.

<review id="7100">Ok, you're perhaps thinking "How can something made of titanium, and having a crush resistance of +2000 lbs be fragile?"It isn't physically.  But it is highly fragile electrically.  I have owned 4 of these stylish drives.  It is THE most aesthetically beautiful flash drive ever produced.  Each of the 4 I owned, except the first which I purchased, was a replacement from the company.  The drive is extremely unstable, and will easily "fry."  By that I mean that it will become absolutely useless, as in;  won't format, wont be recognized by ANY computer, won't light up the "prettyblueblinkinlight," won't ANYTHING.I am very careful with all technology, and I always "eject" my flash drives before removing them, even though technically you don't have to according to Microsoft (HAH!).  Each of the 4 eventually did this resulting in frustration, and occasionally loss of the most recent changes to un-backed-up data (after all you can't back up a 4 GB drive each and every time you use it).I sent the last one (which waited till it was out of warranty before it failed) back to SanDisk with a note about the new Dane I purchased to replace it.  The Dane was far less expensive, almost as stylish, and far more stable.  I have had it for some time now with no problems.No more SanDisk products for me AT ALL, EVER!</review>

<review id="7102">This model has high visual appeal, so I was hugely disappointed when I couldn't connect to configure mine. I'd get another of the same except that my NIC (the laptop's network card) no longer worked when I unplugged it from the router. It may be sheer co-incidence that it worked 2 minutes before I connected it to this router, and was damaged when I disconnected the router, but I don't want to take that chance, so I'm staying away from this product for now. (btw, I've set up a couple other routers in the past, and didn't have problems with them.)</review>

<review id="7103">This review is from: Howard the Duck (VHS Tape)      At first recommended by a friend as one of the funniest movies he had ever seen, I went out on the hunt for a copy of the now-deleted 'Howard' and was lucky enough to finally purchase a copy last week. Why was I recommended this? How is it funny? Set back in the 80's, this dated tale of a cigar smoking, Booze ridden duck who is pulled out of his world (which publishes a magazine called 'Playduck') straight into the bed of Lea Thompson and has the cheek to be too embarrassed. Landing in Cleveland, Howard teams up with Thompson's Rock chick and crew and sets out to fight the evil Dark Overlord. To list this movies good points would be a task in itself, as its inept script, don't care attitude acting and clich?plot, it was no surprise that this little light was quickly blown out. A poor excuse at film-making in every angle, but the only problem is that its stupidly addictive to the end. Hence two stars instead of the dreaded one.</review>

<review id="7105">I purchased the wireless fenced containment system and two pack of backup batteries.  I had seen advertisements that batteries lasted 3-6 months.  Not for me.

I am happy with the containment system, but not with the battery life.</review>

<review id="7106">This is the worst ever router I have tested. I've had cheaper ones doing a better job. The N connection is a waste of time, effort and health!!

<review id="7107">I'm not angry that Bella and Edward got their storybook ending.  The nature of the book, from the beginning, suggested this would be the case.  I did, however, want them to have to work for their happiness, to sacrifice, and to evolve.  I was never worried for any of the character's lives, nothing was at stake here.  Thank goodness that silly love triangle problem with Jake got solved with no hard feelings!  Charlie's okay with everything, no one even got their feelings hurt at the end, no diapers were ever changed, "Nessie" was never a burden or an emotional strain, vampires and werewolves...excuse me, shape shifters, are BFFs.  And Bella had the smoothest transition from human to vampire in the history of the world.  And it made for one boring book.</review>

<review id="7111">This was not the book I expectd at all.  it doesnt even seem to be a book from the same series......I dont know what happened, maybe the author was rushed to get the next book out.  reguardless, its not even close to the other three, which i loved.  the first three books were about Bella, Edward, and Jacob.  Who would she choose?  Would she become a vampire?  What would she tell her parents?  things like that.  I expected this book to answer those questions, and it did, in the first 100 pages???  WHAT??  there are 600 more pages to the story!!  ok, maybe they will be about the hard time Bella has now that she is a vampire, she will be uncontrolable, she wont want Edward anymore, she cant be around people, Jacob will hate her......NOPE!!  none of that happens!  She is perfect, no problems at all.  being a vampire is easy!!  WHAT??  Are you kidding??  I know this fantasy, but come on!  There isnt much of a story if there is no conflict...Instead the story centers around her child, who is, i have to say, the weirdest character i have ever read about.  i found myself constantly rolling my eyes at the things this child was capable of doing.  it was just rediculous!! and to make matters worse, i think the author forgot that Bella was now a vampire.  she constantly wrote about bella breathing, using up her air supply, and gasping for breath.  i cant believe no one caught that before the book went to print.  i found myself arguing with the book over all the inconsistancies...to the point of distraction.  personally i think if the author wanted Bella and Edward to have a child she should have used that idea to start a new series.  this book SHOULD HAVE been about who Bella chooses, if she can ever get Edward to make her a vampire, and what she has to go through once she became a vampire.  We should have been able to read about them all going through those things, there should have been at least some kind of struggle before the happy couple gets, married has kids, and she became a vampire.  Thats what the first 3 books were about, and thats what book 4 should have continued with.She could have started a whole new series with the birth of Nessie.....although I was highly dissappointed with Jacob imprinting on her, I can see how that opens many doors for more stories.  What kind of children would they have?  Will both the coven and the pack except them?  What kinds of powers would this new "breed" have?  its really too bad she chose to give up on Edward and Bella to bring in this new character of Nessie.  It got to the point that I just didnt care anymore.  I could have stopped reading half way through, maybe less.  once they got married, and she became a vampire all the aspects of the story i cared about were resolved.  highly dissappointed.......  too bad, before this book this was one of my favorite series......</review>

<review id="7112">Having used three different versions of Quicken over the years I find that they have become progressively worse. In the 2007 quicken for the Mac this is the worse one yet.  It appears that the developers have gotten lost in the high finance end and this program no longer functions well as an instrument for keeping one's check book.  Some of the issues are:           Screen display not adjustable so you can barley read the characters on a 20 inch screen.           The bell or chi-ching is gone so you have to look to make sure your entry happened.           The payee field will not pop up instead they make you go back into the menu and pull it up.           Deleting an entry is now extra work.And the list goes on and on.  In short they need to learn to walk before taking on space flight!</review>

<review id="7113">I noticed "Designed for Windows" printed on the box as I was opening it. Wish I would have seen this on the product page before buying it. You open the program on a Mac and it looks like you're using a PC. No keyboard shortcuts for things like adding a scene index card, so you have to keep going up and using the pull-down menu. When I tried to rearrange my scene cards, the card to be shuffled turned into a blank card, for some reason. Maybe if I hadn't spent $170 bucks for this, it wouldn't have been so bad. Mac users, I advise you to steer clear of this and try Montage or Movie Magic Screenwriter.</review>

<review id="7114">I bought this mp3 about two years ago, when it was $90. The forward and backward speeds were very slow, not good for audiobook play. The recording volume is low.

<review id="7115">I'm been a fan for about two years, so I was excited about reading the last installment in a series that I enjoyed immensely. But by the time I was finished, I couldn't believe what I just read. It really seemed like some one else was writing this story instead of Stephanie Meyer. For a person who is also an avid fanfiction reader and has read quite a few fanfics based on the Twilight series, I could of sworn the author must of been inspired by some of them...or maybe just ripped some of those plots from fanfiction and put them in her own writing.**Spoilers**For example, the whole vampire prenancy is in nearly half of all the fanfics that exist in this fandom. I was one of those people who actually read the transcript from her own website explaining how vampires couldn't   conceive or impregnate. I don't know how she could just all of a sudden break the rules that she has created herself just so that particular plot device could fit.Who knows, maybe this was an attempt to try to please those kind of readers who maybe would've liked the idea, but thought it all but impossible because of her past statements. All in all, with this attempt at trying to please everyone, it kind of sacrificed her integrity as a writer. I already feel cheated at the lack-luster, anti-climatic effort to end the series, but now thinking about it, I guess I feel a bit lied to as well, wondering how the writing could have changed so drastically from the last three books in such a short time.I mean, I don't why so many people were trying to compare her to JK Rowling. They are both successful storytellers, but anyone can tell how Meyer is nowwhere near up to par as Rowling. I know both authors aren't the best with the mechanics of writing; the use different literary devices to better convey a story, but with Rowling's writing, it doesn't matter. She creates a beautiful, detailed world with characters that you care about and love, with much more depth and development at Book 2 than Meyer has a Book 4. At least Rowling actually has a grasp of proper grammar in her writing than other said author. I can not tell you how many repeated words were slewed throughout Breaking Dawn that could have been remedied if more thought were put into this novel than being so rushed, which is obvious to anyone whose read it.There is more of the novel's plot that I was uhappy about, which many other reviews have identified and described in detail, but I just wouldn't have the time to explain. The one thing that is really humorous to me about this novel(personally funny anway) is that she thanks the band Muse in the beginning and end of the novel for being such a huge inspiration to her. I absolutely love the band Muse, and the Twilight series is partially to thank for my discovering such a wonderful, but wholly underrated band. If I were any one of the three members in that band, I wouldn't exactly want to be associated with this novel here. Personally I would go back and actually rethink what was it about my songs that inspired such a...mess!</review>

<review id="7116">The Vado HD is a winner in most respects. It's fun and easy to use and customer support is attentive. But I've had two of them wipe out the entire day's library with a "Format Error: Press Delete to Continue" message. The system is in lock-down. There is no option but to erase all the stored recordings. The manufacturer will obviously work to correct it. It was quite frustrating to have this happen to me with back-to-back purchases.Otherwise, the product is a delight to use.</review>

<review id="7119">I feel terrible about giving this book a two-star review, mainly because I've loved the series so much up until this point.  I was ecstatic last week knowing that the time was almost up and I would be able to read Breaking Dawn.  I went to the midnight release party - which I've NEVER done before in my life, I'm almost 29 years old.  My 43 year old sister went with me and she was just as excited.  I was home by 12:30am and stayed up until 8:00 am reading on Saturday, until my eyes were crossing and I had to sleep, but the minute I woke at 12:30pm I began reading again.  I was finished by 3:00pm on Saturday.  At first I didn't know how to feel, it was such a STRETCH for me, the direction the book went in - and it didn't have the heart of the previous books, where was the passion and love and intensity between Bella and Edward that was demonstrated so beautifully in the other books, I was sorely disappointed in that they seemed like shadows of themselves.  Edward wasn't Edward, he seemed like a bit player in this story ... as was Bella, all weekend I continued to describe them as "Bella & Edward Lite" or "Diet Bella and Edward" ... and the baby ... WTF?!  I keep seeing images in my head of the scene in Spaceballs or Alien when the little monster comes out of the guy's stomach.  Overall, I'm just sad and disappointed.  I know that this must hurt Stephenie Meyer to see her fans so upset by this book, but unfortunately, it is what it is.  It could have been so wonderful, but it seemed rushed and without the depth of feeling of the previous books.  It speaks volumes to me that so many people are returning their copies and are so upset.  So far, the book is scoring 3 stars on Amazon when LITERALLY - every one of her other books are 4.5 stars - that says something right there.  Anyway, just wanted to add my two cents.  I still love Stephenie and what she has done for bringing a little more romance and love back into literature, but this book should be put in the furthest corner of the bookshelf and allowed to gather dust.  I certainly won't be reading it again as I have the others - and it's just a shame.</review>

<review id="7120">This item does not hold the odor as well as the original cartridge that came with the litter lock unit I purchased at Petsmart.  I bought this 5 pack unit to save money, but since it does not contain the odor it has been a waste of money.  If this is indeed a legitiment item from litter locker, then they must have reduced the thickness of the plastic, which is causing the odors to escape.</review>

<review id="7121">SPOILERS CONTAINEDI love a happy ending to a fairy tale, but I never thought of the Twilight Saga as a fairy tale.  I had thought of it as something much more unique....well maybe something along the lines of the Harry Potter series, but then again that will never be repeated in our lifetime. So I read the entire book today (I did not read any spoilers before hand) and found that I was reading it to see if something would happen to make some sense to go along with the other books.  I was shocked that Bella was pregnant.  I saw the clues foreshadowing it before it happened, but I could not believe that it actually happened.  It did not make any sense for this to occur.  I was slightly in shock as I continued to read because it was not what I expected to happen in the world that Stephenie Meyer had, or I use to think, created so meticulously.  She always seemed to lead us to believe that vampires could not reproduce because of their poisonous venom and their unchanging bodies.  I still don't understand how it worked, but Bella was pregnant and growing quickly, another thing that surprised me.So, Bella is pregnant and we are then taken into Jacob's point of view.  It was a relief almost to get away from Bella's unique and unlikely situation.  We are taken into Jacob's pain and turmoil of losing Bella and just waiting to hear the fateful news that she is turned and will never choice him.  Even when they hear Bella is back and ill they believe it is a lie to cover up the fact that she is a vampire.  They never thought that she was pregnant, which complicates things even more in the tribe.  Bella seems to be this catalyst that causes trouble and discord.  So once they discover that she is pregnant Sam wants to attack, but too conveniently Jacob rightfully becomes Alpha and leaves the tribe to protect Bella and the Cullens.  So, there is discord among the wolves but no straight out fight.  Well as Bella becomes more pregnant the baby is literally draining the life from her.  So due to Jacobs fleeting thoughts they decide to try to give her blood to keep the baby and her healthy.  It irked me that Bella was not annoyed by the smell when through all the other books she was.  I felt that she should at least be repulsed by the blood, but drink it because it would keep her healthy.  Again everything was falling into a neat little package.So the baby is born, basically killing Bella, but she is saved by Edward's venom and Jacob has imprinted on Nessie (again seriously the name?).  And Bella seems like this perfect vampire, again not following the careful rules that Stephenie had made.  I had maybe expected that her aversion to blood in her human life might have carried over and made it easier, but how could it when she was drinking it as a human.  So they have it all and perfect family even with a pet dog.  But then Alice gets a vision that the Volturi is coming.  Finally some normalcy and possibly a fight.  I was looking forward to it to see who would make it out alive.  It seemed necessary that some die to show that some rules of the vampire world still made sense, but I was disappointed.  Sure Iraina died but we had not attachment to her.  I was preparing myself for what J.K. Rowling did in her books.  The reality that not everything ended perfectly.  I was waiting for the impending fight and their being causalities, but it never happened.  I did not want a fairy tale ending because this was never a fairy tale to me.  I did read the book in one day and I could see characters attachments due to the circumstances.  But I wish that was not the case because I thought the book should have taken a different route.  However, she did surprise us (well those who did not read spoilers) but I was disappointed with the neat little package in the end.</review>

<review id="7123">Office 2008 has a redesigned Interface and is supposedly ready for Intel Macs.  I was disappointed in this software - it runs slower on my Mac Pro than Office 2004.  During installation it wants you to delete older versions on your hard drive.  It also has some bugs to be worked out.  I would recommend waiting until it has been updated and the update has been reviewed.Disappointing product in need of an update</review>

<review id="7124">I do not recommend this product due to the poor customer service from Panasonic.We were happy with the quality of the bread, but the machine broke down after 10 months.  The repair process with Panasonic is lenghty and less than satisfactory.  Supposedly, the one-year warranty covers repairs only, but what happens when the machine still doesn't work after the repairs have been made?  All commands on the machine stopped working after 10 months, only off/on worked, so we had to bake only at the preset settings (no timer, adjustments of loaf size, etc.)  So we shipped it off to Connecticut and waited over one month for it to be returned.  They replaced the PC board, and it worked for ONE loaf only.  Then the same problem happened.It has been very frustrating trying to get in touch with Panasonic.  I have spent over one hour in the past 2 weeks on hold, and usually have to hang up without reaching anyone.  They say they only cover repairs, but what when the repairs have been done?  And should we have to wait another two months and pay further shipping charges to have the same machine fixed for the same problem?  We need to have a bread maker and will probably have to buy another one, as Panasonic doesn't seem to stand behind their product.  We will not buy another panasonic product.  I am still holding out hope that they will do the right thing, we shall see.</review>

<review id="7127">No one is a bigger Twilight universe fan than I am.  The first three books that Stephanie wrote pulled me in to her fantasy world and made my own life pale in comparison.  I had such high expectations for BD because I had come to expect a certain level of writing, a distinct writing style and a romance of epic proportion.BD disappointed me.  I found myself shaking my head incredulously throughout the book. While I know the whole series is fiction and fantasy, this book was so out there that even I couldn't find it remotely believable. I felt that I was reading bad fan fiction rather than authentic Stephanie M. I kept waiting for Bella to "wake up", that this had to be a sick dream. I just couldn't wrap my head around the fact of the hybrid/Rosemary's baby. I wanted to accept it, because it was Edward's and Bella's baby, but it was too monstrous to me. It was too alien.  Breaking bones inside of Bella, growing at an alarming rate, chewing it's way out, having such intelligence immediately apparent upon birth.......too freaky.  Too OOC. The whole romantic connection that I felt between them was lost in this book.  And the Cullens -- I missed Alice!  I missed them all. Heck, I missed Bella and Edward because they weren't in this book for me. I don't know who those two were, but they weren't my Edward and Bella. And Jacob -- what a strong focus on him in this book -- and he was so out of character for me! I found it deeply disturbing that he would imprint on Edward and Bella's baby -- Bella was the girl he dreamt about endlessly!  This  was the love of his life up to that point!  The girl he would die for.  The girl he fantasized about, and made mental plans to marry. And he goes and imprints on her hybrid baby??? Bizarre -- the bizzaro world to me. And what was with all those other vampires introduced in this book?  I mean, where were they all last summer (in Eclipse) when Carlisle needed help with the newborn fight? Seems he only had the Denali clan to ask, and they refused and a few vampires Jasper knew in the past, who couldn't be found.  Where did Carlisle and the rest of them suddenly come up with 30 or so other friends from across the globe???I still love the Twilight world, and I still love Stephanie, but this book left me sad and disappointed.</review>

<review id="7128">This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      Wall E starts out fine but in the second half a message that is dangerous and just wrong comes across.  The message is that fat people are lazy and stupid.  Every human character in this movie is grossly obese and lazy.  They stay in recliner chairs that hover and move around so they don't have to.  They are so lazy, they don't even eat their food, they drink it instead.  Then they are portrayed as dumber than dirt when their captain tells them they can grow pizza plants on earth.  They are so excited to grow pizza plants, they wobble and waddle out of their chairs to follow the captain.  It is sickening and untrue.  If Pixar or Disney showed a race of people the way they show fat people the movie would be banned.</review>

<review id="7131">We purchased a refurbished router from this seller.  We were a little wary, but the seller had a good rating so we purchased it.  It worked okay for wireless, but it wouldn't work at all for our VoIP phone which is the reason we purchased it, even though it was the model we needed for this purpose.  When we couldn't get it to work, we took it to the VoIP provider technician and it gave him "nightmares" - wouldn't work at all.  After a lot of hassle from the seller, we finally got a RMA (returned merchandise authorization) and sent it back.  After quite a long time, we were able to get a refund for the purchase price, but not the postage to send it both ways.</review>

<review id="7133">I'm going to be as honest as possible...I love Apple, I've had iPods in the past, and have 2 mac computers.  However I think the iPod touch (really the iPhone, minus the phone) is useless when it comes to everything other than a music player.  My main issue with it, is it's NOT meant for wifi really. I've tried a number of times to get connections while "on the go" and it's pretty tough to sometimes impossible.  Think about it...this isn't a phone where you have a network following you everywhere... your wifi capabilities depend on what connections you randomly pick up (and that's IF it doesn't have a password).  So unless you are in a Starbucks where you know you have wifi capabilities, or your own home (where you might as well just use your computer) this is pretty useless and annoying.  You can't use its basic apps like weather, maps, safari, youtube, stock and mail.... all you have is a music/video player..and a calendar.  That's it.    If you were walking around NYC, and you can't remember the address for something..unless you can pick up someones signal, the maps app on there is about as useless as you are.  As a player though - it works fine and I have no issues with it.  I honestly think this was a cop-out by Apple to make the iPod touch just like the iPhone even though you can't do half as much as the iPhone.</review>

<review id="7134">This review is from: Breaking Dawn (The Twilight Saga, Book 4) (Audio CD)      CAUTION: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSI haven't been able to make myself finish the book - so maybe in the last quarter, maybe(and hopefully) it pulls itself out of mediocrity. Other reviewers have gone into more detail about why the final volume of a nearly-great series is such a let-down. But I'll tell you why it breaks my own heart. One of the primary weaknesses I felt through all the books is the way Bella's other family members are so uni-dimensional and unimportant. Her mom and dad are both from Forks, so why don't they have any family friends, aunts, uncles or grandparents? And Bella's Dad is so conveniently stupid and obsessed with sports & fishing, so he can be tangential to the story. And although Bella moved to Forks as a gesture of love and sacrifice to her Mom, she is not very close to her, and she plays a very thin role in the first three books. In Breaking Dawn, Bella's family are completely negligible, to the point that it sort of makes me sick. Who cares that there are people who are out of their minds with worry about Bella? The author does not treat real human beings with any sympathy. Yuck. The addition of an infant into the family... it creeped me out more than a little bit. But I object to this plot twist mostly because of the inescapable truth: after marriage and children, total boredom ensues. I haven't been able to finish the book mostly because it's so incredibly boring. Jacob imprinting on Bella's child... the only adjective I can come up with is: ikky. The child's human/vamp hybridization, and her speed-growth and special skills: ikky. And her dietary habits: beyond ikky, into the land of gag. Ms. Meyer, could you please re-write Breaking Dawn from the beginning? I would very much appreciate it, and I would buy it again, with my fingers crossed that the second try would be better.</review>

<review id="7136">I've had this drive for several months, and it seemed to work fine.  Then, I was unable to retrieve some family photos from it.  System would lock up on read errors.  So I offloaded all I could and tried a format of the drive.  Failed 7 times.  No diagnostic software provided by manufacturer.  It's as if they are relying on other drive manufacturers to provide it.  Only a basic user guide is provided on their 'support' CD.  Poor support.After downloading and running Seagate's Seatools, the long generic test FAILED.  Why couldn't Simpletech have such a BASIC tool.I would NOT recommend buying this drive under ANY circumstance. Poor initial quality if it won't even format.  I do not even want to send it back for fear they'd send me another.  Dependability is of the utmost on USB hard drives.  Simlpletech is not reliable for me.</review>

<review id="7137">I purchased a refurbished artisan mixer in Dec 2003.  I am totally happy with the mixer.  I asked for the food grinder for Christmas.  The food grinder works very well but the set screw that attaches it to the mixer does not fit properly.  I exchanged the food grinder only to have the same problem.  Kitchenaid sent a new housing and it also does not fit properly.  On one occasion my mixer fell over because the food grinder and mixer did not fit together properly.  Kitchenaid is now sending me a new mixer.  Hopefully this will resolve the problem.</review>

<review id="7138">Sure, this release has lots of "improvements".  I'll focus on Excel.  The biggest potential improvement is that the row and column maximums have been opened up.Beyond that, I've encountered nothing but problems.  *  Once a document is saved in the new .xlsx format, Excel would not save back to the older .xls format.  Instead, it just hung.  *  The software refused to change the limits on a date x-axis of my charts.  Instead it blithly reset the values back to the original values.*  It is SLOW.  Clicking on a curve in a chart could take 10-20 seconds to respond.*  Occasionally, Excel would just crash for no obvious reason.  The up side is that it would restart with opening the same workbooks.Also, as usual, I have been unable to find a place on the Microsoft web site to report such troubles.  All I've been able to find are FAQs that answer queries unrelated to the problems I've had.Maybe you can work with that.  I gave up and am just hoping that my new laptop is still functioning by the time that Microsoft gets around to noticing such glitches and releasing a service pack.  Maybe next year?</review>

<review id="7139">I  have had siberian huskies all my life.  If you are wanting to remove the thick undercoat on your dog, this brush is not for you.  The "bristles" are very close together and short and seem to remove only the top layer of fur and not the undercoat.  After one pass, you have to clear the short bristles of any removed hair in order to make the next pass.  I say, stick with an undercoat rake.  It is much more effective and much cheaper.</review>

<review id="7140">Captain Justice has pointed out that this is not the shoddy first season set Universal released through Best Buy. Fair enough, but people still have a right to be unhappy with the crummy way this series has been brought to DVD so far. The driven crazy Captain complains about such criticisms, but such complaints are justified when Universal couldn't even label the damn DVD included with the blank B sided mini series DVD which wasn't supposed to be blank! You could make a better product at home! Talk about a buzzkill! It was just an attempt at making quick cash off of the fans with no concern for quality! Let's stop covering their butts for ripping us off. Not all fans will buy anything no matter what. Some of us want a decent product for our cash. The good Captain is free to "chill" while forking over the cash, but some people don't like getting shoddy products in return for their money. It's true that I was reviewing the shoddy previous first season set in my other review. I stand corrected, but the 5 star reviewers on here haven't seen it either. I'll play along and give it a 2 since we are all just guessing at how the quality will be. I'll give it a higher rating if it turns out to be better quality than the previous Battlestar DVDs. Maybe Universal will at last give us a decent product now that they have sold us some pretty sad DVDs a couple of times already.</review>

<review id="7141">I'm a scientist and therefore need to use programs such as Excel frequently to crunch my data. I had hoped that Excel 2008 would improve the speed of, say, cut and paste operations on files with 3,000 or so rows. Boy was I let down. An operation that might take two seconds in Excel 2004 would take twelve seconds in 2008. That's going from slow to glacial, in my opinion. So much for Intel native speed!

<review id="7143">Other than the fact this was dead in less than a month This camera stinks at everything from the odd response of the red button not working half the time to the batteries being used up too quick and the irritating way you scroll forth and it goes back/or forth never can control it rigth.  The software is first grade garbage, the videos I made(in the form of "cuts") I could find no real way to spice them together in the order of my choosing, if you "combined them" into a "movieshow' it could be in any random order so you have a joke of a movie editor.  Asisde from the LCD this is a pile of garbage(as in Gretta Garbo's flustering failure of a career-probably more a bad camera angel than old age ha!) and mine is dead.

<review id="7144">Nice pictures from popular games, thats all about it. First, you have what they call the "browser bar" and the media bar. The installation cd advertises it with flash animated intros like if none else in the market does that. But the keyboard ONLY and ONLY supports Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player. You read that right, my $15 old keyboard supports my itunes and Firefox with no problem, the difference is that they make it HARDWIRED, so you don't use "strange software" and look ungrateful to the creator of the Operative system in which your games run. Even before I found all these "issues" the overall look of the keyboard was the first let down. The buttons are made of cheap coarse, plastic and when you switch the keyboards, which is the only amazing thing of this product seems to do, is that they don't sit correctly all the time and leave some in and some out.  You have to do several attempts to finally get it well. The drive that comes on the installation also comes with yet another function added to your tray bar. You know, I'm always looking for more and more background functions to run in the background. If you don't believe me, buy it, but keep your receipt, the box and the cd. If you know what I mean.</review>

<review id="7150">I work as an IT manager, overseeing about 4000+ client computers.  About one-fourth of them are Macs.  I myself am a long-time Mac user, currently using a dual-quad Mac Pro and a 1st gen white MacBook, which I love both of them.Full disclosure: I do not own this new MacBook (although I had planned to upgrade), but we bought several for evaluation purposes to determine whether they would be purchased in larger quantities.  I have used one for almost a week now and have developed a love / hate relationship with them.The Good:The unibody is a beautiful design, and makes for a rigid and solid feeling notebook.  I like the fact they've make it easier to perform hard drive and memory upgrades.  The battery indicator on the side is a nice touch, instead of on the bottom, but I admit, I never used it that much, since I tend to check the battery life when it's on and I check it on the menu bar.Once you get used to it, the new trackpad, it's a delight to use, and the new finger gestures are useful.  The new DisplayPort also seems to work well enough, although once again, new adapters will have to purchased.  Some people have complained about the lack of HDMI, but if you read the specs for the DisplayPort standard, it really takes us into the next generation of video display and is a better standard, IMHO.Finally, the new graphics update is much welcomed.  Graphics performance has substantially been increased, and the 2.0 GHz machines we're testing are pretty snappy when using graphics intensive tasks.  We don't play games with these, but I'm sure gamers will welcome the change.  Our Pro Apps are noticeably faster.The Bad:Naturally, this new manufacturing process has to cost Apple more, but we didn't except to pay so much more for a computer with worst [basic] specs than what we were getting in our purchase of the white and black MacBooks.  Except for graphics performance, our CPU benchmarks are very lackluster in comparison.  Our IT budget is very tight right now, and it's going to be hard to justify a purchase with so little difference in performance.  Respectively, each model, compared to the MacBook model it replaced, is only 6% and 12% faster.  These benchmarks have been independently verified by many Mac-related websites.Several of our early testers are complaining about the ultra-glossy (or glassy) screen and the quality of the display itself.  Our offices are brightly-lit and it takes quite a bit of adjustment to properly see the screen without severe glare.  This isn't as noticeable in low-light environments, but we also see poor side-to-side viewing, meaning you almost have to look at these dead-on straight to see a good image.  Comparing it to earlier MacBooks and MBP's, these new models are much worse.  Fingerprints are much more noticeable also, and the glass front bezel seems to be a fingerprint magnet.  That's not a big deal, but they complained that  calibration doesn't help the color flaws in this new display.  These use LED displays, as opposed to TFT displays that the previous MacBook had.  I think it's just a cheaper panel, because other reviews have had no major complaints with LED displays in the new MacBook Pros.Lastly, and most important to me as a technician, is the lack of a FireWire port.  Many of my peripherals are FW and also I frequently use the Target Disk Mode (TDM) in my job of diagnosing, repairing, saving and migrating data from other Macs.  Even though I had planned to upgrade, I now have no choice but to keep what I have.  Also, our Media department will not be getting upgrades.  They also use video and audio FW devices that cannot be substituted or re-purchased simply because Apple choose to leave FW out on this model.  Not only is cost an issue to go to a MacBook Pro, but many of us liked the smaller footprint of the 13" model.I find it ironic that Apple increased the graphics performance to use their Pro Apps more effectively, but left out the very port that is used to import the video and audio files for those Pro Apps to work with?  Many of us would have even traded the ethernet port for the FW port, since you can get a USB to Ethernet dongle.Also, since our department uses cloning software to quickly install drive images for our clients, this will affect us dramatically.  USB, is not only much, MUCH slower, but less reliable.  You have to turn off any software that may execute during the clone.  In our tests, we found something as small as "Little Snitch" coming on during a clone install, is enough to choke a USB drive to almost stopping the clone process.  It's a much slower and more unreliable process.I know some people have stated that FW is dead, but no, it isn't.  It is continuing to be developed into a faster standard.  And USB-3 isn't a reality yet, so saying that USB-3 is coming anyway, doesn't do anyone any good at the present since only USB-2 ports exists on these models.  And yes, I realize some people have never heard of FW and to them, this is no big deal.  Although, part of the power, and reliability of a Mac, is the fact you can make an exact, bootable clone of your hard drive, and within minutes of a major hardware failure, be up and running, and continue to do your work, while your hard drive is being replaced.  This is a powerful feature that some people will never know until it's too late.  Granted, you can basically do the same from a USB drive, but if anyone has ever had to do so, they know how excruciatingly slow it is.  And of course USB cannot duplicate the functions of TDM.These new MacBooks will find buyers, there's no doubt that for many people they will be just what they need, and again, they are gorgeous and probably very durable.  But people that depended on FW and have an investment in FW devices, will need to think long and hard about this upgrade.  Also, I would recommend anyone wanting to purchase, to visit the Apple store and examine the LCD display for themselves.Although a minor complaint, I don't like the fact Apple makes you purchase the $1600 upgrade in order to get a lighted keyboard, that's as bad as the "black" tax (the black MacBooks costing more).  Using three stars as an "average" upgrade, I'm only giving this upgrade two stars because I feel Apple took too much away in relation for the price they are charging. This is unusual for me, since Apple products usually get my highest praise.  If this were a new product line, without anything to compare it to, perhaps it would be different.  But, the plastic MacBook continues to be the better deal for us at this point, although we will continue to evaluate them and see if perhaps Apple decides to release another revision with some improvements.1/31/09 Update:For those on a budget, and those who can live without the unibody design, but still wants / needs a MacBook, I encourage you to check out the newest refresh of the white MacBook.  They have made some substantial upgrades but have still kept the price down to what is, I think, a very affordable, but high-quality laptop from Apple.  We recently purchased ten of these and have been very happy with them.  The performance upgrade is very noticeable, and we can still use our FireWire peripherals and display adapters.  Since we are still using our original evaluation units together with our older models, we have also noticed better Wi-Fi reception on the polycarbonate models, as have other users.  But, in fairness, I will say, other than a couple of issues (mainly with DisplayPort adapters and the trackpad), the new MacBooks have performed well for us, and we have not had any major issues with them.You can find more info here:http://www.apple.com/macbook/white/</review>

<review id="7153">Before you can actually use this product you first must accustom your pet to the PediPaws. Unless he or she is in a coma, your pet will absolutely despise the sound and vibration of it. Don't let that deter you! As the caring, dedicated pet owner that you are, you will persevere! After one very long week, I learned that Sophie the dog is more patient than stubborn, and grudgingly learned to "put up" with the tool. However, Fuzzy the cat refused to do the same--he saw no need to suffer fools gladly.The experience revealed two major drawbacks with the PediPaws: It files the nail in miniscule amounts at a time and can only be used in bursts of 7 seconds or so. (If used longer, the heat generated through friction could injure your pet.) If your dog's nails are overlong, this project could take you days---maybe weeks. Even if the nails were recently trimmed, you will have to constantly file them to maintain that length.If you and your pet are extraordinarily patient, you would probably not even worry about purchasing this product, but you might enjoy the challenge of using it nonetheless. If you find it hard to resist a new gadget or power tool, I recommend buying the complete Dremel Drill Tool Set. That way, when you abandon using it to file nails, you will be able to find less dubious uses for it.As for myself, I intend to keep it and, during evenings while watching TV, I will file my own nails. It is my hope that its sound, vibration and heat will remind me to never again purchase anything that is: "As Seen On TV."</review>

<review id="7154">i read this book because i work in a bookstore. i read the previous ones and found that with each instalment it just kept getting worse, and as this series appears to be somewhat popular people ask me what i think of it... and i just don't feel comfortable speaking poorly something i know nothing about :P this said, after reading the third book i expected to give this a disgustingly low rating, but instead it just made me look at the series in a new light. i've written reviews on the other books so for my own sake i won't go into detail about what i think the series lacks, i'll just sum it up with saying that the author just isn't too good at what she does. the story of twilight is pretty standard when it comes to vampire romances, so the formula has been proven to work, but the author lacks the skill to develop characters and relies heavily on plot throughout the series, which can work, but she sets up the story in a character driven setting, so that doesn't really work. also, i feel as though a teenager is writing this. the logic, the manner in which the characters speak and the way in which the narrator presents the information... some reviewer somewhere said it reminded them of a fan fiction, which is a very appropriate label now that i think about it. so that also got under my skin a bit. taking these kinds of things into consideration, i relabelled this book in the series as a book you would find in the romance section of the book store, without the emotional catharsis of sex (then again it is very pg and the characters don't really show much desire for each other beyond saying how much they love each other... so words only). basically a soap opera for kids. and i suppose in my mind the first books were trying to be received as something more than that, which is why i think i was so disappointed. so ya, but not like the jane austen kind of romance, more the nora roberts or christine feehan, the ones where you roll your eyes constantly, but enjoy it because you know it isn't supposed to tickle your intellect in any way. that said, this isn't a negative category to fall under, but i don't think that's where this author would want these books to be. on to the book itself (yes i actually plan on talking about the book at some point during this long and pointless tirade). as i had the lowest possible expectations going into it, it wasn't that bad (thinking about it as a romance also helped). the characters seemed a bit two dimensional emotionally and there was quite a bit of filler that could have been left out as it didn't develop either plot or characters, but just kind of existed. teenage marriage and pregnancy were definitely taken very lightly and were almost promoted, but as i stopped taking it seriously by this point i wasn't very concerned about it. the author also promotes her morality more noticeably than in the other books, but this isn't really something to be concerned about i don't think. the issue with jacob and the baby seemed to be one of the things that turns people off a lot in this book, besides the fact that it was designed to be somewhat convenient for the plot and for modern morality, pedophilia and what not. i think the author just handled this awkwardly. she wanted jacob out of the way, but wanted everyone to have a disney ending, but wasn't too comfortable with the subject matter i don't think. (on a side note, a series that handled a romantic connection like what jacob and the baby had effectively is the black jewels trilogy by anne bishop. that one was decently done). so... if you read the series i would read this book as well, it won't be stellar, but it's better than what the last one left you with ... i wouldn't buy it though.</review>

<review id="7155">If you are thinking about upgrading from a regular ipod to a touch...get ready...to replace all of your accessories.  I thought about that before I made my purchase, but I guess I didn't thoroughly think it through. My pricey, but oh so excellent, Shure headphones don't work with my new touch, and that completely burns me!Also: the Touch is really cool, great features, fun as hellbut think about where you live and what you really need.You are dependent on internet hot spots for connectivityI am unable to connect to the internet at home...I can connect at work, BUT I have to step outside to do it.I will admit that I am a toy junkie and did not think this purchase through... I had to have it...but, right now, all I can do with it at home is play solitaire or listen to music on its tinny little speaker.

<review id="7156">This is just an awful laptop. The product is very cheaply made. One of the keys popped off the first time we used the keyboard and it could not be put back on. After several efforts to get through to their support site which is down for hours at a time we finally submitted a support request that fell into a black hole and was never answered. A popped off key is a minor issue but the fact that it started falling apart the moment we got it and the fact ASUS support is horrendous does not inspire confidence. Spend a bit more elsewhere and get a decent product.</review>

<review id="7157">I purchased this product on Amazon because I was told by everyone how great Frontline worked.  Ha Ha! I put it on my dog to rid her of the few fleas she had. Well let me tell you, it did nothing. Someone from my local pet rescue told me it works for about 4 days.  I even bought the plus which is supposed to work well beyond 30 days.  Maybe it's a new formula, or maybe the fleas have found an immunity, but I can tell you the product did nothing for my dog and her itching.  I recommend you purchase a different product.</review>

<review id="7159">These calipers are not up to any form of reliable measurement, because its premise is far too simple.The instructions include no equations of any kind, and the pinch is intended only for the abdominal skin-fold.  Once you measure the skinfold, you take the result (in millimeters) and compare to a color-coded chart which pairs a man/woman's age and measurement to show the bodyfat percentage within the colored stripes of (ideal, overweight, obese, etc.).This is too simple for a bodyfat measurement.  There was no regard for body weight, height, or other skin-fold areas.  It would have been nice if the instructions at least included equations so that I could measure myself more accurately on my own--but, no.Granted, the "click" feature is pretty cool, and lets you know exactly how much pressure to apply while measuring.  However, if you're a trainer or someone seriously trying to lose body fat and measure your progress, you'll need normal calipers with formulas.  This is too basic.  A toy.</review>

<review id="7160">I bought this item from Amazon for $686 on Oct. 30, It was delivered to me on Nov. 7th. After I rcvd the product, Amazon had already dropped the price. I was too buys to call and ask them about the price guaratntee. Apparantly there price guarantee is only for 7 days (the time it takes to receive the producct). I am very upset that the product has dropped in price by $90 in 24 days. I would not buy this product. At this rate, amazon will be giving these away for free pretty soon. It is a lousy camera. Very bad low light pictures, too noisy and the menu system on the camera requires a PHD in engineering.</review>

<review id="7165">I recently purchased this new madel Braun razor. I have owned several Braun shavers before, most recently one of the 8000 series. The overall quality of this model is well below that of the 8000 series. The fit and finish is poor and the razor doesnt dock well with the base. It took three times for me to even get it to charge. I would suggest saving the extra $100 and going with the 8000 series.</review>

<review id="7167">After all these years, the trolls in Redmond still have not learned how to produce user-friendly software. There was no reason to make the changes to Office that they've made; it was simply a way to justify an unnecessary upgrade that has turned out to be a downgrade. Users with a moderate understanding of how Office operated will find themselves flummoxed when attempting to do things they had finally learned how to do in the old version.The much-vaunted ribbons are confusing and counter-intuitive. Microsoft addresses this problem by offering free self-paced trainng courses, apparently oblivious to the fact that time iS money, unless of course, it's Microsoft's time.At the very least, one expects backward compatibility, that is unless you're dealing with Mr. Bill's minions. I loaded Word files created with Office XP, only to find the Office 2007 converted them with serious defects, like inserting tabs in all paragraphs whenever you inserted one in a single paragraph. And, of course, if you delete a tab stop from one paragraph, you delete it from all of them.Useless.</review>

<review id="7171">To me there are 2 types of pads. The economy pads that are really thin, don't soak up the urine, create wet tracking paw prints on my floors but all in all serve their purpose if you don't mind the extra mess/smell and are way cheep. Then you have the great pads like Advanced that soak up the mess/smell, minimize paw prints, and never leave my floors damp but cost a little bit more.These Hartz pads are the worst of worst and priced about the same as the quality pads. The Hartz have cheep backings which my chihuahua completely soaks thru in the mornings. It is terrible picking them up. Plus if he pees once then he tends to poop on the floor next to the pad because the pad is gross and full so he doesn't want to stand on it. I have a chihuahua not great dane so if he doesn't like them then these must be made for tea cup pups.</review>

<review id="7172">Where do I start....this thing has been a pain in the butt after the first 5 minutes of opening it. The U3 software is so annoying and not compatible on my laptop and there is only 14.7GB on it, not 16GB. I kept getting an error and I couldn't even access the device(I/O Device Error). So then I went to my other computer and I could get into the device but I couldn't open any files. So I removed the U3 after a bit and reformatted the drive so It was back to normal. It worked for like 10 minutes and it started doing the same thing over. So now I'm going to reformat the drive(so my files get erased) and send it back. And...[I did remove the U3, all my files still turned corrupt a few days after i removed it and I had to reformat it every time(clearing the drive)]Don't buy SanDisk... read the reviews online like I should have before I bought it.I'm going with the 16GB Sony Micro vault flashdrive...

<review id="7173">If you plan to buy one of these Cuisinart grind & brew machines, please carefully note the complaints on cleaning.  They are valid. My particular problem is the grinder sticking inside the unit, and it is major.  I solved this somewhat by purchasing a second grinder unit so that hopefully one would always be clean, dry and ready to go.  That system failed over the Thanksgiving weekend, when we were brewing pot after pot.  Once again, the grinder stuck, requiring the use of vegetable oil and pliers.  I'm sure Cuisinart would not recommend this method, but I no longer care if I break it.</review>

<review id="7174">I have only used this for four days, so if this suddenly starts working, I will alter this response. But for now, I am not impressed. Like I stated in the title, a strong cup of coffee could bring about more results. I had some cramping, nothing horrible, a little gas, and some meager small loose stools, sometimes just a little water. No weight loss, no real mess being eliminated. Perhaps my plumbing isnt in need of a detox? Who knows. But if I had the chance to do it over again, I would have opted for an expresso rather than this.</review>

<review id="7176">I have had previous Microsoft Office programs for over a decade. I thought "Why not just use WORKS? It's so much cheaper and compatible". Bad idea - it saves ALWAYS in unusual Works formats, so other people cannot read your work without Works. There is no (known) way to save always in another form - EVERY time you want to save as another (more compatible form) you have to go a select it - it does not remember, and it tries to force you into the Works format. Similarly, if I have just gone to the trouble to SAVE in .rtf or .txt form and then close the file right away, it asks if I want to save the changes I just made! But it means "as a Works" file. Lame, too much work. Very slow to work this way. I have had to change to another word processing and spreadsheet program because this was TOO incompatible with their own formats. It CAN be compatible, but it takes far too long.</review>

<review id="7179">We purchased this product for the top of the stairs in our home.  At this time, we are still in the process of installing this piece of garbage.  So far, we have had problems opening up the battery compartment door, because the screw was stripped.  While that was frustrating, it is nothing compared with the fact that 2 - yes, that's right, TWO - of the screws used for the mounting hardware have broken off.  Now, we have TWO broken off screws in our newel posts and no way to get them out.  I have to believe that this is NOT how the manufacturer intended this gate to work.  Now I have an inferior gate that will not be installed properly and my daughter may or may not be safe from spills down the stairs.  Additionally, when it is time to remove the gate we will have TWO broken off screws sticking out.  That's nice and safe, now isn't it?  I can already imagine the lovely cuts and scrapes that my daughter, future children, and their friends will enjoy thanks to the shoddy manufacturing by Summer Infant.  Please, please, PLEASE do not purchase this product.</review>

<review id="7181">I will start from the end and tell you I returned this PC after only 2 days of working with it.  I consider myself above the average computer person with more than 20 years of working with PCs.I purchased this model as a second laptop mainly for travel, weekends and just to have a very ultraportable PC always with me. The other one i leave in the office.The model i got was running Windows XP Home Edition with 1GB of Ram.I wasnt sure if to get a 8.9" inch screen or go for the Acer or LG models with 10" screen.After installed everything including Office 2007 and Outlook, skype and other small application, the problems came. The real issue came after working more than 30 minutes on the PC, i started getting headaches. The 1280 x 768 resolution is very crisp and clear HOWEVER HP laid a protective layer of plastic or other material on the screen making it very reflective and difficult at times to focus.I tried to increase the font size of webpages without any luck and i was still getting a headache after 30 minutes or so. I also changed the entire screen resolution changing the full system to 120 DPI in advanced mode of Display resolution for those you who know where it is. This also did not help.Then after realizing that may problem with this PC was the headaches i was getting I actually searched google and WOW ! I found quiet a few reviews and blogs where people where getting headaches with this type of screen.I wasnt crazy. Many people actually reported headaches with this screen.Without much wating I packed the entire PC and returned it !.  Yes this is the first time in my life i return a PC after only 2 days of working. Instead of this model i purchased an LG X110 with 10 inch screen and the LCD is non-reflective and does not give me any headaches. I am very happy with this model. In fact i am writing this review with my new LG and my eyes and head are perfect.Therefore, PLEASE before you purchase this PC try to work on it in the store or at a friends home with this model more than 30 minutes, see if you get any headaches or problems focusing and then decide to purchase it.</review>

<review id="7183">A fitness manual referred these calipers to me as the cheapest most accurate self-measurement body fat % device out there. The fitness manual has been correct about just about EVERYTHING else except these.  I've lost around 6-10 lbs of fat (15 lbs total) and at least one pant size and yet my caliper reading has not changed at all. I do multiple readings just to make sure, with different amounts of skin pinched off, and still don't see any significant change in reading on the calipers. The advertisements for this that it is the ideal way to measure body fat is true for calipers in general, not this one specifically.  In general, calipers are almost as accurate as submersion in water (which works because fat floats muscle sinks), but the drawback is that you need to go to a special facility to get the submersion test done. Unlike this calipers which measures only one skin fold on your stomach, other calipers measure skin folds on multiple parts of your body (you usually do 4 different places each time) for their accuracy. In short, I would recommend sucking up your anxiety over letting someone else measure you and get a real set of calipers or you won't be able to tell for sure if you're losing weight from fat or muscle.</review>

<review id="7184">This review is not being written in effort to counteract the image of the product.  It is an appraisal of this drive after having used it.This drive was purchased primarily to use as a backup drive for personal data that would be automated once per week.  It was purchased for it's size, the fact that it does not require an additional power supply adding to the already existing countless power cords that connect my equipment, it's sleek design, and the fact that I thought that I could use it to run automated backups.  Prior to purchasing this drive Toshiba was contacted for specification details and was given the impression by their mal informed technical support that I would be able to use this drive to automate back ups.  However, upon plugging in this drive it was first discovered that when my computer went into standby mode the drive did not and it went spastic, spinning erratically and making clicking sounds until it was either unplugged or the computer was brought out of standby mode.  Contacting Toshiba tech support they now told me that the drive is only to be used as storage drive and that it will not power down with the computer and that it is not intended for the type of backup that I wanted to perform.  In addition to that, the NTI Shadow Backup software that is included with it is beyond comprehension and does not offer the option to bring the computer out of standby mode to run the tasks, it only runs when the computer is on, otherwise if you use the NTI software for scheduled backups just be sure to be in front of your computer at time of scheduled backup, otherwise the job will not run making this software very unreliable.  Tech support for Shadow software also seems to be uninformed as the support rep had to continuously put me on hold to retrieve answers my questions.  What's also very annoying is that the USB cable supplied with this drive is only about 10 inches in length, so if you have a tower type computer you need to purchase a separate longer USB cable to connect it.With regard to Amazon.com's service, the drive was sent with free standard shipping  and was satisfied with  receiving it 7 days after submitting the order.  It's  price was terrific also, at $83.01, it was dramatically less than other online resellers.  Returning the item was hassle-free and only required me to print a priority mail shipping label at my expense, which seemed reasonable considering that I did not have to pay the delivery shipping.  Only disappointment with Amazon is that they instruct me that they will be deducting the original shipping from the refund.  An accurate appraisal of the refund turn around time cannot be made at this time as refund is still pending as of the item returned on 1/22/09.To sum it up; the Toshiba USB 2.0 320Gb drive does not allow for automated backups because it needs to be unplugged to be powered off, it does not have it's own power mode, if the computer goes into standby mode it does not know what to do making it obsolete as a reliable backup drive.This drive will be replaced with the Western Digital My Book Essential 500Gb External USB Drive witch supports it`s own power cable.</review>

<review id="7186">I bought the Sandisk Sansa m250 2GB from [...], and I was initially very pleased with the player. I liked the small size of the player, and I found it to be a very handy little contraption. However, after 3 or 4 days of receiving the player, it stopped recognizing music, and it began to leave out letters on the titles of songs and albums (for example, Blue Oyster Cult would be displayed as Bl Os C, and Billie Jean would be displayed as Bil Jn) and it eventually froze on the opening screen and completely stopped working. I called Sandisk's customer support and was told of a method to use for resetting the Sandisk, which did NOT work. Please, don't waste your money on this MP3 player. I found it to be extremely poor quality and overall a waste of money.</review>

<review id="7187">I sent it back.  Video camera is very good if you want to shoot 60 minutes of video and then delete it to shoot some more.  However, the camera's self-contained software (including their "updated" software from online) to transfer even the shortest video to any of my three different computers and operating systems and/or e-mail failed due to "error" with the only instruction given:  "Try again later."  I read all the bad reviews, all the fixes offered by experts, and tried. Pure Digital offered to replace the camera, maybe, someday, after I send them serial numbers, etc.  But, that might be too late to then get my Amazon refund if software still defective.  Believe what you read about this camera not working.</review>

<review id="7188">I really wanted for this gadget to be useful.  I have been waiting for it to release for a long time now and was particularly interested in the slingprojector capabilities to be able to stream Internet video from sites like Hulu, Netflix etc. to my TV.I hooked it up via HDMI and gigabit ethernet to my router.  The setup was pretty painless.    I was able to connect and view my slingbox at a remote site effortlessly.   I was a little disappointed at how bad the video looked but attributed that to upload bandwidth from the remote site as opposed to any deficiency with the slingcatcher.Then the problems really began.  The slingprojector software recommends projecting a window at a time as opposed to the entire screen since this is supposed to improve video performance.   Window sizes however are limited to 1024/768 which means you have to resize etc in a non-intuitive manner.Video quality despite various performance changes I made was choppy and unwatchable.   I stream video to my apple tv all the time so I know that the network supports high quality streaming.  There is nothing I could do to render a decent video image.   Even the regular computer screen i.e. non video tasks exhibited a lot of lag between the keystroke on my machine and when it showed up on the monitor.   The slingprojector software is also a performance hog and noticeably slowed down the machine.Finally, to add insult to injury the computer lost its connection to the slingprojector and despite reboots would not connect again.  it took a reinstall of the client software and then a factory reset of the slingcatcher to get it to work again.I will be returning it promptly.  I guess it is fine to use as a standalone client to watch a remote slingbox but if you are buying for the sling-projector functionality as I did, I would be wary.</review>

<review id="7189">Although I feel silly for reading these books that are meant for 13 year old girls, I decided to finish the series since I have wasted so much time on them already.  My biggest problem with this series is that Bella lacks any redeeming qualities.  I feel like they are sending a disturbing message to the target audience....that girls (who eventually grow up to be women) measure their self worth based on men.  Yeah, we get it, Edward is perfect in appearance and personality and Bella is not worthy of him.  This is repeated for 500 pages.  But, she is so utterly co-dependent that she can hardly function when Edward leaves her.  She has zero self-esteem which I feel is something we all struggle with, but why repeat it over and over again? Of course she has shortcomings, it wouldn't be realistic if she didn't.  But what happened to the strong female heroine with qualities that young women should aspire to have? That they can go on living and functioning despite the fact that they are alone.   I can read these books and appreciate that they are silly and insignificant, but young teenage girls may think this is how women are supposed to think and feel.  On a positive note, if you are looking for superficial, mindless and(somewhat) interesting books, these books will quench that thirst.</review>

<review id="7191">Forget everything you ever knew about Microsoft Office.  Office 2007 looks and feels like nothing you've ever used before.  If you make the mistake of buying this latest Microsoft disaster you will have to learn how to use your applications all over gain.  Why Microsoft decided to produce this joke is beyond me.  I've had Office 2007 on my machine for about a year, and I still spend amazing amounts of time trying to find basic tools that were easy to locate on previous Office versions.  The folks at Microsoft have managed to take a good product and make it totally useless.</review>

<review id="7192">My Sansa Fuze didn't work out of the box.  The sound was distorted and if you just even barely grazed the ear bud cord, the thing would sound like a skipping CD.  I thought maybe it was just a problem w/ the ear buds, but I tried another set with no change.  The buttons and having to spin the little control was just too confusing.  In the end, I just ended up sending the thing back to get a refund.  I wouldn't buy another one of these again.</review>

<review id="7193">I purchased this wheel after vast researching and I must say I love the way it feels. The wheel assembly iteslf is outstanding!! The one shortfall was the paddle shifters as they do break. The pedal assembly is a completely different story. Throttle control is essential in today's games and these pedals are junk!  When they work, they are adequate, but they WILL break. I can comfortably say this as I have returned 3 wheels so far to be replaced due to pedal problems. The culprit with the pedals are the pots (potentionometers) that are the electronics in the pedal assembly. They are cheap at best. The mounting assembly is insufficent and the pots themselves are ridiculously sub-par. Plus, Logitech does not sell replacements. I did find them via a 3rd party company finally. But, I find it hard to digest that Logitech risks so much potential on a product with $0.30 parts (which cost $7 ea to replace via 3rd party). Ultimately I would have to say stay away from this wheel. But, if they fix the design deficiancies..buy no other!!!!</review>

<review id="7194">Sometimes filming a movie in an exotic locale with artists, poets, love triangles and red cars end up being just a smutty collection of artists and poets in an exotic locale that drive red cars. This film was very unsatisfying for me. First of, after having visited Barcelona a number of times many years ago, I was looking forward to a good movie about the city, but the Barcelona scenes seemed to be edited to show as little of the city as possible. Second, as a big fan of Penelope Cruz's movies, I expected great things only to find out that she is totally unconvincing in this movie. The scenes of her as a painter and taking pictures are painful to watch. I would say there are really only a couple of bright spots in the movie. Javier Bardem does a good and convincing job of acting, and Scarlett Johansson's character seems fairly believable. In any case, this is one of those movies for which the intention seems to be to make an artistic movie with meaning, but for me it comes off as being a collection of art-movie motifs with no apparent meaning and a couple of Woody Allen's New York characters thrown in.</review>

<review id="7195">I HAVE HAD THE EARLIER MODEL OF THIS SOUND SPA FOR OVER A YEAR.  YES, THE STAND DID BREAK OFF.  AFTER HAVING IT FOR MORE THAN A YEAR THE SPEAKERS SEEM TO HAVE BLOWN BUT THAT'S BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN USED FOR EVERY SINGLE NAP & OVERNIGHT SLEEP MY SON HAS HAD SINCE HE WAS 3 MONTHS OLD.  IT HAS BEEN THE BEST WHITE NOISE MACHINE BECAUSE YOU CAN SET IT TO THE VOLUME (MINE WAS ALWAYS AT THE LOUDEST FOR HIM TO SLEEP) AND TURN IT ON & OFF WITH A PUSH BUTTON.  MY SON IS OLD ENOUGH NOW THAT HE TURNS IT ON & OFF HIMSELF.  HE LOVES HIS SOUND MACHINE.  I'M NOT SURPRISED IT'S FINALLY HAVING ISSUES BECAUSE IT'S BEEN USED AND ABUSED AT FULL VOLUME FOR SO LONG.  I THINK THE STAND WOULDN'T HAVE BROKEN IF IT HAD JUST STAYED IN HIS ROOM & NOT BEEN TRANSPORTED AS OFTEN AS IT WAS.  I WISH THE OLD MODEL WAS STILL IN PRODUCTION.I BOUGHT THIS NEW VERSION TO REPLACE MY OLD MODEL. HERE ARE THE CONS: 1) THE WATERFALL SOUND IS MOST LIKE WHITE NOISE (NO WHITE NOISE BUTTON ON THIS MODEL) BUT THE WHITE NOISE SETTING ON THE OLD MODEL IS MUCH SMOOTHER, SOFTER, AND MORE CALMING. 2) THIS NEW MODEL IS LESS ATTRACTIVE IN MY OPINION.3) TO TURN THIS ONE ON YOU HAVE TO TWIST THE KNOB & TURN IT UP TO THE VOLUME YOU WANT EACH TIME YOU USE IT, AND YOU HAVE TO TWIST IT TO TURN IT OFF.  THE CONVENIENCE OF LIGHTLY TAPPING A HUGE BUTTON & HAVING A SET VOLUME IS GONE.I MISS THE WHITE NOISE SOUND ON THE OLD ONE, PLUS THE WAY YOU TURN IT ON & OFF WITHOUT CHANGING THE VOLUME SETTING.  MAYBE IF I HAD NEVER HAD THE OLD CONVENIENCES TO COMPARE IT TO, THIS WOULD BE A GOOD CHOICE.  IT DOES GET NICE & LOUD LIKE THE OLD ONE TO TRULY BLOCK OUT OTHER SOUNDS.  IT'S ALSO SMALL & WOULD BE GOOD FOR TRAVEL TOO.  I GAVE IT 2 STARS FOR THE PRICE, LOUD VOLUME, & THE SOUND QUALITY, WHICH IS VERY GOOD.  I'LL PROBABLY END UP USING THIS ONE ONLY FOR TRAVEL FOR HIM, AND KEEP TRYING TO FIND MY OLD MODEL SOMEWHERE, SOMEHOW.</review>

<review id="7196">I bought and use ACT from version 2! I was and I m really enjoyed for the concept program which is really usuful,but from the version 6 they change the internal program language, and it was very very slow. I bought the up grade since V 7, but no really satisfed for the price we invest since the version 6,they are not spectacular modification in the speed, and the new possibilities are not as they promise in term of productivity. We prefer to use our version 6!.Ovoid to buy it, you will be disapointed for the speed, and try to buy an used V.6, best value price/possibilities! and for the price you install it in various machine...and when ACT Vxxxx will be really speed with major updates,you can always have the possibility to upgrade it for less money.Hope its help.</review>

<review id="7197">This was my very first iPod that I had gotten last year for a gift. I was very pleased with it for a while, until I ran out of space to put all of my music on. There is no expandable memory for this iPod, and that is not a good thing if you are going to shell out 80 dollars for this product. The size of this iPod could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it. I carry a small purse without a lot of stuff in it and I had a hard time finding the thing. The perk to having a smaller iPod is that it doesn't take up a lot of space. One of my other gripes is that there is no screen there to tell you what is playing and how much of the battery you have left. All I have on this is the colors of the flashing little light to give me a rough idea. iTunes is easy enough to use but it can take a long time to load one song onto your iPod. That is why I switched to an iPod classic to give me what I wanted and more.</review>

<review id="7199">This blender was great ... while it lasted, which turned out to be just 6 weeks! I don't expect to pay almost $80 for the privilege of using an appliance for 6 weeks. On top of that, I wrote Amazon's customer service to inquire about a refund or replacement and did not get a response to either of two emails I sent over a week's period. I finally decided to call and the person offered me a refund or exchange. I was originally wanting an exchange, but after coming back to this page and reading other reviews, hearing a couple that said even their replacement broke within weeks, well I figure I'm better off going to a local store to get a blender. It might still break, but at least I can walk back in with it to return it instaed of going through all this. The automatic refund processing center for Amazon doesn't work after 30 days and the blender wound up with a loose screw rattling around in it's base just 2 weeks past that deadline. This for a blender that was set on one counter out of the box and never moved more than an inch in either direction. It seems the vibration of the motor itself is enough to shake it's internal screws loose, and since the loose screw is within the sealed portion of the base you can't possibly get to it to remove it. Defective product and I strongly suggest anyone think twice before purchasing it. Or just hope you're one of the lucky ones who gets a good one.</review>

<review id="7200">Very dissappointed.  As huge as this is, and I bought the large one because I have 2 cats, the inside litter area is very small.  The filter takes up about 1/3 of the box.  My cats hated it!!!  I had to take the top off and the filter out so they would have some room to move.  The bottom is fairly thin, too, and when I either lift it or move it to clean out the dirty litter it "bends". I also didn't like how it had to be rolled almost totally over in order to get the clumps out.  I personally don't recommend it; it's gawdy and takes up far too much room.</review>

<review id="7202">This review is from: Howard the Duck (VHS Tape)      For a VHS copy of this movie, you cant actually charge $20 when its not worth more than $5. I also liked the movie, but never read the comic, Ive found this movie for .10 CENTS on ebay, and you have the audacity to sell it that high and rip people off. You can also get it from Hollywood video for $2.99. People that waste that much money are really dumb.</review>

<review id="7203">Oh boy, did I have high hopes for this product. After listening to the neighbor's young white german shepherd bark at everything that did & did not move, I finally broke down and bought this with some reservations. Now, we're talking about a measly 10 feet or so from unit to dog, and all it did was get the dog's attention. That's it. Barking did not decrease in any way. However, in talking to a vet about its effectiveness, he did say the dog's intelligence does factor into it (smarter dogs will understand cause & effect; e.g., if I bark, this will happen). I sure wish I had known that before because this dog is untrained, non-obedient, and dumb as a post. Caveat emptor...</review>

<review id="7204">I am on my third Drinkwell fountain.  The first one lasted 5 years.  The last two have each lasted less than a year.  This one is "gone" after less than 6 months.   Am I the only person who thinks it is just impossible to clean the motor?   I cleaned it once on my first unit -- not at all on the last two.  My cats love this fountain and I want them to have running water -- I'm willing to think of this as a disposable item if I can get a year out of each unit -- but less than 6 months is a little more than I can manage.  I can't believe Drinkwell can't improve this product so you don't have to disassemble and clean the motor in order for it to work properly.</review>

<review id="7205">Every since they left New Caprica, this series has gone into a tailspin.  I had hoped that the 4th season would rescue the plot from the abyss it was sliding into.  No such luck!I watched the first disk and fell asleep in the middle of the second. I've lost interest in even finishing it.  I was hoping those four turning out to be Cylons was a red herring.  Why is it that only the Law and Order franchise can stay true to what made it great to start with.I won't mention the marketing/packaging stuff.  Enough others have beaten that horse dead.</review>

<review id="7206">"I used this exactly once. Why only once?

<review id="7207">===Revised Review===I bought this from a "bricks and mortar" store and had no idea that it did not contain the whole of season 2 (See rant below). That said, Amazon makes it clear that this is only Volume 1, so if you want to buy it, this is the only place where you will do so knowing for sure what you are getting. Back when the second half of the season had not yet aired, this would have been a no-brainer purchase. Now, you must consider the fact that a complete version of Season 2 will probably be released soon. If you are a hardcore fan, you may want both as collectibles. Another thing to consider is that this "Volume 1" version doesn't contain extra features that you can't get elswhere. The audio commentary on these DVDs consists of the podcast commentary which is available for free on iTunes and other places. The new, complete Season 2 MAY contain more extra features.To be fair, the new BG, as a whole, is the most compelling Science Fiction I have seen in a long time and probably the best show currently in any genre. I will be buying the complete Season 2 when it comes out. If I had known that this version contained only half of the season, I probably wouldn't have purchased it, at least not when I purchased it--which was well after the complete season had aired. If I had known about this preliminary version before the season was over, I definitely would have bought it at that time.===Original Angry Rant Below===There are too many apologists here saying that the quality of the show justifies the false marketing. That is simply not true. It doesn't matter how good the show is, a lie is a lie. The box says Season 2.0 and offers no indication whatsoever that it contains only half of that season. The demarcation "2.0" cannot be reasonably construed to indicate half a season. A simple "Volume 1", as Amazon has done, would have sufficed.I'm not arguing price here; half a Season may be well worth what they charged, but not when the box cover is deceptive. I did not have to be duped into buying this. I am a fan, and I'm happy to show monetary suport, but for now, the warm fuzzy feeling that comes from supporting artists I respect is gone.</review>

<review id="7208">Well I just got this keyboard as a Christmas present last week. At first I was very excited about it and agreed with the other reviews. The keyboard looks nice and doesn't take up an acre of space. I also like the keyboard backlighting but would like to see it be adjustable.Now on to my problem. This keyboard doesn't seem to generate the proper key event messages for Shift, Ctrl, and Alt. Using the Microsoft key test application (mskey.exe) you can see that when you press and hold the Alt key you only get a single key down and up event instead of a stream of key down events with a single key up when you let up on the button. This means that games that require one of these keys to be pressed (like the Shift button to run) won't work. I have not yet tried to get in contact with technical support to see if the problem is just with my keyboard or with the firmware or drivers. The drivers shipped with the product are version 1.0. There are no driver updates for this keyboard on the Razer website. In fact there is no Lycosa section at all on the support site for Razer at the moment. Definitely an early version of the product.I really shouldn't have put an untested keyboard on my Christmas list! You may want to hold off until the issue is resolved and updated drivers are posted on the Razer site.</review>

<review id="7209">Stay away from Netgear products! Mine rarely works and I can get no response from Netgear what so ever. Take a look at the discussion board on their own web site for this product, you will find a long list of people having the same problems and getting the same response from Netgear...none! Mine is going to sit on the shelf above my computer as a reminder, to do better research before buying.</review>

<review id="7210">This review is from: Wall-E (Two-Disc and BD Live) [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)      Before I start, the low rating is for Amazon, not the film.  I LOVE THE FILM. I'm reviewing their bizarre mistake with the 2 blu-ray versions of this movie.I'm not a digital copy fan. I think it's the same excuse as HD-DVD's combo con to make a few (usually 5) extra bucks without giving the consumer a choice. Because there's no way on God's earth it costs them 5 bucks to produce it. HD fans WANT the highest quality, not neccesarily a lower-quality version of the SMAE thing in the SAME box (which is what you got in the past with no choice, and what you get if you but the 3-disc version of this movie. There is NO new/different content).So imagine my joy when I saw that there are 2 Blu-ray releases, one with, and one without the digital copy! Fantastic - now I can buy the one I want, which is this movie looking as good as it possibly can. If I'd wanted the convenience of portability, I'd probably just get the standard def dvd that I can play anywhere. Not both. So, fantastic. I don't have to pay a few bucks more for something I don't want!So what do Amazon do? Discount the non-digital-copy version LESS than the other, making them the SAME PRICE! How on earth does that tell Disney or anyone what we prefer as consumers?!So rather than get the 3-disc and have an extra bit of non-biodegradable landfill (do you see the irony there, Amazon.com?), I'll get the 2-disc version. But maybe now I won't get it from Amazon.FInally, what ever happened to Amazon's info on extra content? Is there even one Blu-ray page that has it? Because that would be really helpful in letting people know for example that the digital copy is just the first disc again, but in standard resolution...As for the film, four stars. Wonderful, beautiful.</review>

<review id="7211">I'm terribly disappointed with the third book in this series.   Bella irritated me with her indecision and selfishness. All she does is gripe moan   and whine about unfairness throughout the entire book. I have to admit that the ending left me little more satisfied than New Moon (but I would have been much more content if the book ended with Jacob punching her in the face)and the pacing wasn't as slow as Twilight. The writing is just horrible, it's a shame I got sucked into the cliched plot and shelled out around 40 dollars. The magnet motif quite literally made me scoff.</review>

<review id="7212">The adapter was inadequate to get Wi-Fi into my second CPU -- I had a laptop next to it to confirm the signal strength was strong -- but the USB adapter was to weak to even open up a web-page.The supplier issued a RMA quickly but I have yet to get my refund.</review>

<review id="7213">The Mac version of Intuit Quicken is complete garbage. I used to use the PC version, so when I switched to Mac, I thought it was a no brainer to get the  Mac Version. Big mistake. The best work to describe the software is clunky. Unlike its PC counterpart, it doesn't work very well--one of the rare instances of a Mac product actually being inferior to a PC product. It doesn't sort data columns, so it's very difficult to say, see what payments you made to the same payee. It also uses weird rules to categorize your downloaded transactions; if you don't watch them like a hawk, it will confuse all your inter-account transactions. The result is once a month I end up reconciling my checking accounts by hand, thus defeating the purpose of financial management software. I'm replacing this just as soon as I can find something better. Save your MONEY!!!!</review>

<review id="7214">My brother bought me this coffee maker for Christmas, but I picked it out.  It was a big mistake.  It just stopped working after two weeks.  The indicator light would go on but nothing would happen.I wish I could say I miss the Zojirushi but I don't.  Even when it did work, it would leave about a half of inch of water in the reservoir.  As other reviewers said, you'd have to push the "on" button repeatedly to get it to force more water through, but it would never totally empty the reservoir.  I'd end up pouring the excess water out into the sink.Another inconvenience is the cap that goes on top of the decanter after the brewing process was over.  It's a nuisance keeping track of that cap.I replaced the Zojirushi with a Mr. Coffee that is comparable in features but is a whole lot better.  The coffee is just as good and stays just as hot for several hours.  There's no cap to fool around with, and the built-in clock also functions as an indiglo nightlight for the kitchen.  Finally, the basket-shaped filters are easier and neater than cone-shaped filters if you use a coffee mill to grind coffee.It's not worth the time or the hassle to try to return this piece of junk under warranty.  I bought the Mr. Coffee at Target on a Saturday morning, knowing that it wouldn't be a big deal if I needed to return it.</review>

<review id="7217">We purchased this hard drive for our son. He used it with his lap top. It was sitting on a coffee table when it was knocked over. A fall of about a foot. The hard drive motor froze. Seagate informed us it would cost $700 to $2200 to retrieve the information from the hard drive. ??? Yes, $700-$2200!!! Upon investigating a cheaper way to go, I found out this is an ongoing problem with Seagate products. Tips and falls will break the motor. This is the real world folks. Things fall over. If they can't make a product that lasts, buy something else. This site made me choose a star but I won't even give this product one star or Seagate's customer service. Nuf said...</review>

<review id="7219">My son lived in his Kiddopotamus fleece until he outgrew it/it got too hot.  When we went up a size, I got the cotton knit, figuring it would be a similarly fantastic product.  Unfortunately, I was mistaken.The whole idea of swaddling is to keep baby nice and tightly snuggled in, and the fleece did a fantastic job because it didn't have much stretch.  The cotton knit can be stretched to about two times its length.  My (formerly blissfully quietly sleeping) three-month-old would wiggle out within 15 minutes and wail until I'd rescue him and repeat the process.  I eventually threw it out. The other drawback to all the Kiddo's is that they use velcro. So if you have an angel who will sleep through diaper changes (they do exist!) you will absolutely certainly wake him or her while unfastening the velcro.  I found that the Amazing Miracle Blanket was a five-star product.  Once I got that one, I even gave up on the fleece Kiddo!</review>

<review id="7220">I bought three of these drives to use for backups for Macs.  Opened one, hooked it up to an Intel iMac (OS X 10.4.11) via firewire and nothing appeared on desktop. Disk utility didn't see it; System profiler couldn't even identify the firewire device (though it saw something) on the firewire bus. I powered it off, tried the usb port and it doesn't even register in System profiler, much less come up.  Opened the second drive, same thing: nada.  Tried using my own cables, tried opening it on a PPC mini, a G4 laptop (all running 10.4) and a Dell Win XP laptop and no joy.  I have had 1.5 TB external RAID6 firewire/usb enclosures attached to these machines with no problems so the disk size isn't the issue. I've built many extern drives via enclosure kits and had no problems (some chipsets wouldn't boot a Mac but they always appeared), so this is a big warning flag.By chance one (and only one) time, when I tried swapping their cheap power bricks between the two, and magically one (but only one) of the drives appear.  I started Disk Utility to wipe it and about halfway through repartitioning it to HFS, it disappears with a warning about it being disconnected from machine.  Power cycled the drive, and got a kernel error forcing a reboot of the machine.I did not bother opening the third drive because I decided even if it worked I shouldn't trust data on a product that had already failed 2/3 times. The drive's powerbrick is a small two-prong box (1x1x2"), that looks remarkable similar in quality and heft as a cheap cell-phone powerbrick.  I'd have no problem with with a super lightweight cheap feeling plastic enclosure nor cheap feeling powerbrick if it worked, but it seems like Western Digital has a real lemon here.  Only after I had these problems did I notice the reviews on Amazon (4 out five gave it one star). Add one more warning to stay away from this product...</review>

<review id="7221">What bothers me about the "Twilight" series by Stephanie Meyer is the whole theme about vampires. I mean, besides that they don't exist, vampires have always been traditionally, well, evil. And a book (and now film) series that glorifies vampirism is not something that the masses should be enjoying.      Ms. Meyer is, I'm sure, a good writer but she really needs to find a less dark subject matter to write her books about. Granted, the Cullen family does not drink the blood of humans but they probably shouldn't exist at all anyway, since vampires are not something to be taken lightly.      It is a good thing that Bella and Edward do not engage in pre-martial intercourse during the events of the first book (I'm not sure about the others), but the whole theme of young love can be easily warped and twisted. Also, love between a vampire and human is not natural (obviously) and is rather dark and creepy.      What disappoints me the most is that many Christians have embraced the Twilight series, a move that is very unlike what the early church would have done. They would have undoubtedly shied away from such material and instead taught what vampires really represent: evil.      It is books and films such as these that are living proof of Isaiah 5:20, in which the prophet warns people who turn evil into good and good into evil. Isn't that what this series is doing?</review>

<review id="7222">I personally didn't buy this gate, specifically because of the alarming number of reviews I found online about plastic shards breaking off of it. The following are only two of MANY reviews I found:"Buyer Beware. We had two different gates sent to us. The initial one was missing a part. The second one had little pieces that were falling off of it the size of a piece of rice and sharper then you can imagine. We found this out because our nine month old was gagging on a piece - then investigated and found two other pieces on the floor. We took the part we needed out of the new gate and put it in the first one we received. We looked, and though that one looked okay. Last night I found two pieces that had broken off on the floor, thankfully before my son did. This happened to us twice - not a coincidence. I have talked to guest relations and they are putting out a product recall. This could have been a FATAL situation with our son!""DO NOT BUY THIS! I CAN'T BELIEVE I ORDERED THIS! Even after seeing one review that said they found dangerous shards of the product on the floor, their child had choked on these pieces. I just recieved the product and looked it over, it looked fine, set it up and put my 7 month old in it. He cried a bit so I climbed in...that is when I found some small rice sized VERY SHARP! pieces of the gate that had fallen off from it . I can't figure out where they came from. I assumed the other review must be a fluke or that the problem was fixed as they said the company was suposed to put a recall. I called the company to complain and they said they had never heard of the problem, and only offered to send a replacement gate. If a small child swallowed one of these incredibly sharp pieces it has the potential to be fatal!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!"In short, the product should probably be recalled. Do not put your children at risk!!</review>

<review id="7223">This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)      We rented this movie last night and became so bored with it, we turned it off midway. The 1st five minutes with the false trailers are mildly amusing and so we thought we were in for some belly laughs. Nothing could be further from the truth. The premise had potential, but there is nothing funny about this movie, no snappy dialogue, no quick comebacks, not once did we laugh after the opening. Sure, it has star potential, but the script was just awful, the characters weren't even decent parodies. Reviewers who say this is a good movie are just pandering to its extraordinary cast, but it was painfully clear that none of the cast actually read the book, er script (one of the "jokes" in the movie), and put it all together. The best thing about the movie was the panoramic scenery, which was gratuitously blown up, over and over. If you want belly laughs, see Step Brothers. Ben Stiller, you need new writing partners. I wonder if Will Ferrel is available?</review>

<review id="7224">I really wanted to like this book since Twilight was so enjoyable.  First the pros.  I thought the premise for this series and the plot was a good one.  It was the follow-through that had the glaring problems.Ms. Meyer told the story with a blow-by-blow account of each character's facial expressions.  I found myself becoming annoyed after awhile at how the story would stop dead in order to describe scene after scene of what everyone's face was doing.  When Edward left Bella, we spent 500 pages watching her mourn.  I wanted to find out what Edward was doing, because it was probably going to be far more interesting than watching this pathetic female whine about the hole in her chest, do stupidly dangerous things, and forget to breathe in just about every scene.  Who forgets to breathe?  Really?Because she kept doing stupid things, I found myself rooting for the evil forces in the book to do her in.  How many times was she a victim in need of saving?  Every character in the book did nothing but save her from doom at regular intervals.......then say how brave she was.  Ugh.  Seems that survival of the fittest would have killed off this ninny long ago.And by the way, the expression on my face as I type this is one of sarcasm, my eyes are looking to the left, to the right, and then down.  What might that mean?</review>

<review id="7225">This is the third 4th generation iPod Nano I bought and all three have failed me and all three were brand new! I'm not sure what the problem is since I've owned numerous iPods before with absolutely zero problems. Upon receipt, they upload my music, play and charge as normal, then just die on me a few days later. Oh well, I still have my other functional iPods to play with...</review>

<review id="7226">This machine doesn't get hot enough to create truly crisp waffles.  Using an infrared thermometer, I read the surface temperature to be only about 400 degrees Fahrenheit on the highest setting.  My 20 year old Toastmaster reaches almost 600 degrees when I select "dark".  These waffles come out much crisper and darker than those from the Cuisinart.</review>

<review id="7227">I have been ready to file since the start of February only to be blocked by the messages about the IRS not having forms ready. So I waited for the Feb update, which then became March 10th. I downloaded today's update and now it says "late March". I contacted Customer Support and they 'think' it may be as early as "the 12th...or 13th". The form IS available on the IRS website. I am very disappointed in how this software forces you to wait for a bundled update one 'hopes' will have the forms needed to file. I'll be going back to TT next year I guess...</review>

<review id="7228">I purchased the griddler as a Christmas (2006) present for my husband.  Initially, he was thrilled.  It worked better than we had anticipated.  Our love affair with the griddler, however, was EXTREMELY short lived.  By late January, it had begun to "act up."  It would occasionally and unpredictably turn itself off.  Not long after that, the griddler began shutting itself off every time the temperature was turned above "warm."  Though I was shocked at how quickly the item broke, I was still optimistic.  After all, "lemons" happen from time to time.  I emailed Cuisinart asking what I needed to do to make a claim on the warranty.  TWO WEEKS LATER, I received a response telling me to call or email with the model and serial number of the bottom of the unit.  Given that their initial email response took so long, I called and was left on hold for over 30 minutes.  When I finally reached a surly customer service representative, she informed me that they would send me a new unit for $10.  I asked why I had to pay $10 when their unit was defective and was informed that it was a limited warranty.  She told me that I should have read the warranty before purchasing the unit.  I was further instructed to package the unit up with my contact info and a claim number the representative provided me.  After they receive the unit and payment, they will send a replacement.  Apparently, there was no way to tell me how long this might take.  This experience has ensured that I will never purchase a Cuisinart product again and I thought I'd let others know about my experience in case they too do not like defective products and terrible customer service.</review>

<review id="7229">A total rip off.  Unless you like to clean up a huge mess.  I'd give this ZERO stars if it was possible.  Pictures are included(links at top of page). The design flaws are:  Grease squirts out all around the sides.  Making the whole product needing cleaning and whatever surface you're on.  When you raise the top grease runs off it to the back of the griddler.  I want my money back.  This is CRAP!! If this review doesnt help you decide NOT to buy this.  Then maybe you like messes?  Good Luck.</review>

<review id="7230">I had the old red wingman formula force for 5+ years and it was great. never a lick of a problem in any way.Ive looked at this momo for a long time thought it looked cool, was logitech and got one.a disaster from the start. this thing is a testament to " how cheap can we make this and get away with it" mentality.first you MUST remove your keyboard tray. noway around that.it has a single cheap plastic screw clamp in the center with no handle on it like the dual clamps with knobs of the formula force. so after removing your keyboard tray and all that, go get a wrech to tighten this thing. you can never get it tight enough for it to not slip around on the desk, thats what happens because a single weak cheap center clamp creates a pivot point for the wheel unit.it sits too high on the desk. the top of the wheel was just under my chin. I had to raise my monitor up almost 6 inches then the whole setup is weird, not a natural driving position.the pedal base is cheap and lightweight, and pedals stiff.it raises up under your heel when using the pedals, if you brake hard, the whole base picks up in the back and spins to the left because the pedal is on the left side of it.it slides away from you even on good carpet if you even bump it with your foot. its terrible. I had to double-sided sticky tape it to my carperting and now cant move it. those little spikes on the front do nothing and pick up if you step on the front of the base and it slides away.The wheels grinds and is stiff. if you turn left/right fast it resists and makes a 'whirring' bearing sound. the plugs are both on the front and hit your monitor stand. you cannot disconnect one plug like the old red wheel and put it away, it always has that cord pernmanantly attached and makes it a hassle.I broke the cheapo plastic screw clamp tightening it after only 3-4 remove/installs to the desk. less than two weeks.its a pointed plastic screw with no knob for tightening. you cant get it tight by hand and i figured since they put a wrench hexagon shape to it, you are supposed to use a wrench so i did,well its such cheap plastic and you have to get it so tight to prevent movement the wrench end broke off. now its stuck on my desk and im wondering if amazon will give me a refund broke.Logitech tells me to order/buy another plastic screw.and they admit the design is flawed. got to Logitech and read some of the many many horrid letters I and others have written concerning this wheel. I should have. Thats why the price has dropped so much here, but theyre still 100+ in stores.My highest recommendation to NOT BUY this product. I was their biggest fan believe me with my old red formula force, but this thing is junk. total junk not worth 5 bucks. youll be replacing clamp screws bi-weekly or more. Logitech admits its a bad design but does nothing except sell you more plastic clamp screws! lol.and it grinds , its stiff, the base slips, you have to remove keyboard tray....just take a pass on this one, Im sending it back and buying a microsoft wheel locally.I saw the old red formula forces for sale here- well worth the price those things are the best, this momo thing is the worst.</review>

<review id="7231">I have had this model for about 2 years and I found it very disappointing.  In order for it chop up an onion, for example, you need to hand cut the onion into several *very small* pieces -- otherwise the blades chop some of the onion and leave other parts unchopped.  It's good for items that are already small --like nuts, but it's a nusiance for chopping vegetables.  Another issue: the plastic lid is of poor quality -- the lid has developed a small hole on top and now I have to keep my finger over the top to prevent liquid from spraying out.  This mini chopper is a good idea with poor execution.  I am surprised these are still being made.</review>

<review id="7233">The story line was interesting at times.  The acting had some high points.  Other than that, not good.  The "artistic" (?) use of superimposing the actors was confusing.

<review id="7235">Funny how amazon.com hid the bad reviews which are true about this router. There is no UPnP and Port Trigering, The DMZ option does not work, port forwarding does not work,And funny, Linksys confirmed all these problems when I called them. Linksys support has no clue about supporting these. I had to get to A Level 2 manager for support. These are overpriced for what functions on them. Half the functions dont work on it, there is nothing good to say but its junk.</review>

<review id="7236">The video plays well on a MACBOOK PRO, but is jerky on a POWER BOOK G4 at 1.5GHz.  Why bother when there are perfectly good point and shoot cameras with video capability.  The Plip is not in the resolution league of a several hundred dollar digital camcorder like a Canon HDD. For smallness try a Leica point and shoot, eg C-Lux 3.  Getting it to recharge is also a hassle on a MAC, never got it more than about 60% per the icon and won't charge in sleep.</review>

<review id="7237">Unfortunately, I have to give these only two stars.  It would be one, but the fact that Seventh Generation is a great company overall earns them one bonus star.I wrote a glowing review for the Stage 1 diapers (check it out and vote it helpful if you like it!).  I also found stages 2-4 to be quite good.But around Stage 5, leakage started becoming a big problem.  The bigger the baby got, and the more he started to pee, the more these dipes started leaking!  :-(We're potty training our 28-month old now, so he generally doesn't wear diapers during the day, but he does at night.  He cannot wear these overnight, or he will wake up soaked and uncomfortable in the morning.  In contrast, he is always dry and comfortable with equivalent Pampers diapers.  So that's why the two stars; there are brands out there that keep the baby dry all night, and 7th Generation stage 6 simply doesn't.I think if your child is still wearing diapers all day, and you change them frequently, these could be a good buy.  But I would strongly recommend against trying to use these overnight.  Do buy other 7th Generation products though!  The paper towels, tissues, dish soap, laundry soap, and napkins are all great!</review>

<review id="7238">I bought this book looking for one or two good ideas that I could apply to make myself more productive.  I did find a simple idea in the book that is usefull, but the other three hours I spent reading it were very tedious.Perhaps if you aren't very organized it will help you more, but if you are fairly productive already a better book to read would be The Biology of Success by Bob Arnot.  It has a chapter on organizing your office that I got more usefull ideas out of than this entire book.</review>

<review id="7239">At first this MP3 seemed wonderful, but it jammed within 3 weeks of owning it. It's on its way back to Amazon right now. Too bad!</review>

<review id="7240">Just plain useless. Was not returned because then Amazon's free shipping would be cancelled.  I then ordered the 415, becuase I had that one originally. Subsequently it has been modified, and is just a bit better than this one being reviewed.  Either poor quality control, or they tried so hard not to cut you, that these cut nothing.</review>

<review id="7244">The Halo sleepsack is the only brand I have found that makes a sleepsack in cotton.  If I knew of another, I would buy that instead.  In general, it's a great idea versus using a baby blanket as the baby can't kick it off or get it caught up in her face.  But the Halo sleepsack has a zipper that you have to attach at the top and zip down.  This makes it seriously difficult to put it on her when she's already sleeping.  I've twice knocked her in the face trying to either attach the zipper or unzipping and detaching it.  It would make more sense to have the zipper already attached at the bottom and zip it up.  I have another one in fleece by a different maker that does this and I can easily get it on her even if she's sleeping and in the dark.  But I wanted one in cotton for summer.  I'm going to take the Halo's I have to a seamstress to change the zipper.</review>

<review id="7245">After reading so many glowing reviews on this product I decided to buy it. And, being frugal, I opted for the factory refurbished product. What they don't tell you is that this version doesn't come with a product manual, set-up disk, or a serial number. So, I looked on Netgear's website for set-up directions. They have the product manual (Amazon has a newer version), but no software. I then called Netgear Tech-support. As I drilled down thru the choices on the phone, one of the messages stated that you need the serial number to complete the registration, or they won't talk to you. Nevertheless, I waited to talk to the support guy on the other side of the world and finally he answered. He confirmed that the factory refurbished routers are provided without serial numbers, software, or documentation. I still believe this will prove to be a good product once it's connected. BTW, I posted a similar review on Tiger Software's website (where I purchased this item), and apparently it was too negative to post among their 4& 5 star ratings.</review>

<review id="7246">Bought this router in January 2008 (version 8).  Easy to install, but had to reset often when it would go on the blink.  Spent many hours with technical support people--who were polite but not exactly top notch.  After about ten months, the original one died and Netgear sent a replacement (for which I had to pay shipping, even though it was within the one year warranty).  The replacement lasted all of three months, then also died.  And I did not get a fresh warranty for the replacement, so my warranty has run out even though the replacement only lasted three months.  I am going to go with another brand next time.</review>

<review id="7248">I was hoping for a "below the neck" quick, clean, bloodless solution with this electric shaver, but I was disappointed.  It doesn't trim long hairs very well and when going for a clean shave it leaves me red, irritated, and bumpy.  For trimming, a plain old Wahl electric razor works better.  For shaving, a disposable Mach 3 cartridge or similar works better.  Also, the device just feels like cheap plastic.  Save your money on this thing and spend it elsewhere...</review>

<review id="7249">I bought this router with the dma2100 media center extender (I have posted a review for the DMA2100).  I was "upgrading" from the WRT300N to this router as it seemed like a good deal for gigabit networking and the extra USB port for a storage link.  I never used the storage link option as I spent most of my time dealing with the router's "hiccups".  The main hiccup I encountered was DNS resolution.  I could see the machines in the DHCP client list, but could not ping by name.  Therefore, if a drive was mapped on one of the machines on the network, the mapping sometimes failed on system startup.  The other issue I had was occasionally, an IP address conflict would occur on the network.  All machines/devices on the network were set to use DHCP.  The wireless networking was set to not broadcast the SSID, with MAC address filtering enabled, WPA2 + AES encryption and a strong key, so I kinda doubt that someone else was using the network, though I admit it's not impossible.  And last, a minor gripe about the pages that are displayed following a setting change to the router setup.  It always seemed that the times it displayed that it would refresh after a setting change were too short.I have returned this unit to Amazon and have "downgraded" back to the WRT300N, which is working like a champ.  I don't quite get the speed on my laptop that I did with the WRT600N, but the reliability is worth it.As a side note, I did ensure that the latest firmware for both the WRT600N (1.01.36 build 3 at the time) and DMA2100 (not sure what version for the extender as is downloaded by extender utility) was downloaded and installed before I set up my network, so getting the latest firmware wouldn't solve the issues.  IMO, Linksys seriously needs to release a firmware update to the WRT600N.</review>

<review id="7251">After having Quicken for some time and being accustomed to that format, once I received my Quickbooks, it was clear to me this purchase was a mistake. Unlike Quicken, you can not preview any of the columns. You can't highlight a Payee and see all the transactions regarding that entry. You can not sort the entries by date or alphabetically. It just isn't condusive to a long time Quicken user. So if your planning to get off Quicken and start with Quickbooks, my suggestion is scrap that idea and go with Quicken's 2009 "Home & Business" program which I just purchased only 3 weeks after trying to get use to this one. And now with the Hoime and Business program installed, I can breath a sigh of releaf and I feel like things are normal again.</review>

<review id="7252">The box is OK for those days when you just don't have time to clean out the box. Just tilt the box over to the side until you don't hear any more chunks falling to the top, then tilt it back and the chunks get deposited into the waste removal basket and the sand slides back into the part the kitty uses. Takes about 30 seconds to clean the cat box. You can get the big chunks cleaned out, but you don't really get the sand very clean. It's full of waste and some of the chunks aren't so small. I still have to clean it at least twice a week the old fashion way. The cat box is HUGE and requires a lot of space to roll it over. I have to move it out of my service porch to roll it, yet the part the cat uses is not very big in comparison, and I have the large box for a single, small cat.It's really messy. When I roll it, even though it is closed and locked properly, it gets litter all over. When the cat uses the box he kicks sand out all the time. There is a huge mess every time. I wish there was some kind of flap on the front to keep the sand from getting all over.All in all, If I had it to do over, I wouldn't spend the money. It's a great idea. I don't think it needs to be so tall. It would be easier to handle if it weren't. I wish the screen was smaller so it would clean the sand better, and the doggy door kind of flap to keep the sand in the box better.UPDATE: after a couple month of using this box, I've gone back to my standard cat box. This just doesn't clean the litter well enough, and it's so messy, It's just easier to do it manually.</review>

<review id="7253">I just got my copy from Amazon yesterday. Installed it in my MacBook Pro to upgrade from Quicken 2002. The result was a disaster. Luckily I have backups. Quicken 2007 crashed with almost anything I try to use. Bring up account list crash... clck the Insight button crash... even quitting will crash. There is nothing I can do with this program. Just pitiful.

They have a 60 day refund policy, guess I'll make use of it.</review>

<review id="7254">Installation software doesn't allow me (maybe it will allow you) to change the RAID setting so that you can use it save up to 2 TB as it's advertised.  RAID is the name for the way the drive is written to, with "RAID 0" setting writing 2TB once over 2TB and "RAID 1" setting writing 1TB twice over 2 TB to backup what you write. Installation software says you can change RAID settings default from 1 to 0, but when you click on that option to launch it, the installation ceases.  I'm using Vista 64 bit system.  Yes, I've looked at the manual and on-line help, and tried WD's customer service--that amounted to "don't plug into power strip and don't use USB hub to connect to PC", with no help for my issue which is that the installation software isn't installing.  I can write stuff to the drive so the drive is "there" but I'm not confident the stuff I write is backed up on the default Raid 1 since I have no way of seeing the backup or how much space of it is used.  Also, Beach Camera's 15 day return policy is too strict, especially if you take time to try to first work out a problem with the manufacturer that isn't too quick on the assistance. If you like a gamble, this product might be fun for you, but that's not why I want an external backup HD.Update on my installation problem.  Western Digital help desk (yes, they are responding), says "But the issue here may be that you are using Vista 64 bit." and their on-line site says Vista 64-bit isn't supported for this drive.  So if you have Vista 64-bit and are thinking of buying this drive---well, the answer is obvious.  Product specs shown when I made the purchase are:  "Windows?2000/XP/Vista" but as I now know, that's not fully correct.  Seller (Beach Camera) has 15 day return policy--not enough time to figure out installation issues dealing with the manufacturer, but seller came through after one month by offering to take it back.  Update--not only did Beach Camera agree to take it back, they did apply the refund--give them a big plus for helping out!  Still, if you have Vista 64-bit, this device ain't gonna work per my experience and per the manufacturer's specs on their web site, which unfortunately doesn't show up when you look at the product info to see if you want to buy it.</review>

<review id="7255">I have a love hate relationship with this product.  I love the way it looks, but it has two major design flaws. After six months of use, I have learned to work around these flaws, but I would not recommend this coffee maker to a friend.I have two issues with this coffee maker.  First, the burner where the pot sits is very shallow and if the carafe is not placed exactly right on that burner, the water will not drain into the pot but get trapped in the brew basket until it overflows all over everything.  When we first got this coffee maker, this happened AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK.  Many, many times have both my husband and I thought it was placed properly only to come back and find coffee all over the counter and grinds in the pot.  I have become fastidious in noting the position of the carafe and so this happens to me only occasionally now, but it still happens to my husband a lot. My other complaint is that the water reservoir is at the VERY back of the coffee maker, and the water indicator is built INSIDE of the reservoir so that I have to pull the coffee maker way out and look STRAIGHT DOWN into it to see how many cups of water are indicated.  It cannot be viewed any other way.  I have learned to just measure carefully in the pot at the faucet, but why such a poor design?  It is inconvienient at best.Since an upscale coffee maker like this is a significant investment, I think the consumer deserves a more thoughfully designed product for the price.  In my opinion, it's a classic case of form over function.</review>

<review id="7256">I can not describe the disappointment I felt reading this book.  I could not put down the first three.  It was seriously like an addiction. It was all I could do to finish this one.  Did Stephanie Meyer even write this book because it was not the same voice and the characters were so different.  Edward, whose confidence was so attractive in the first books, was weak.  Rosalie, who had no relationship with Bella, was now "Rose," and she was the closest person to Bella.  We hardly saw Alice and when we did it was basically when Bella needed fashion advice.  I guess the only character that did not change is Jacob who continued to do what he wanted, no matter how annoying and self serving, but always forgiven immediately by Bella. Jacob should have been left out of this one.  I did not need to hear anymore about him after the 3rd book.I am very saddened that this book did not finish with the same characters I had loved, and with the same gripping story line.  This was not a page turner.  Even though these books are fantasy I could envision what Stephanie Meyer wrote about, but this one was so ridiculous I did not even want to waste my time.  Can she call this one a rough copy of the final and rewrite the final episode?</review>

<review id="7257">I got a replacement camera of the same model, and the Firewire port now works automatically on Windows and Mac, as it is supposed to.  The only criticism I have is that there are no Canon repair centers near me, and otherwise, having a new product like this checked out is a real hassle, and as is the trend, there is not very proactive customer service as a concern for Canon.But, this is an unbelievable deal.My Original review follows:Good camera.  Better video quality than the ZR-800 and has a microphone input so that you can really do some nice filming with this camera.  No light on the camera, despite advertising. There is NO motor noise at all, despite what others write.  Canon haters have been complaining about motor noise on Canon cameras for years, but there is none on this device.For the price, in decent light, there is probably no better camera.The down side is--the firewire does not work.  I have a Mac and a PC.  And a firewire port.  The port sees other devices. It will not see this camera, and believe me, I have tried it all.  In short, it is VERY difficult to get video onto a computer for editing and movie making, despite Canon's claims that it can be done via the firewire port.  I even bought 2 different cables to make sure.  Instead of plugging in the camera via firewire to my laptop, I have to export the video by plugging in an analog  miniplug from the camera into my rca input jacks on my DVD recorder, record the video onto a standalone DVD-Recorder I have in my bedroom, and then put the DVD-r into the computer and input the video into iMovie.  Very inelegant and very time consuming, multistep process.In short, I HATE companies who just out and out LIE to their customers, and, sorry Canon, that is what you have done here. How could they possibly have shipped a camera with a firewire port and not have known that is not functional? Doesn't connect to a Windows XP PC, does not connect to a Mac. Gigantic disappointment</review>

<review id="7258">Purchased my first unit, brand new directly from Creative on June 6th 2008 - It refused to work immediately. Called Creative (on my own dime as they offer NO toll-free service or support) and was given the two hour run around. After finally getting to the right person, I was told to return the unit which I did and a couple of weeks later I got another. This one, obviously not new as it was scratched and a corner was dinged, worked for about a week but never properly, hanging frequently during the boot process. Another call to Creative, another two hours on hold during which I managed to find and download the updated firmware myself from their site. The new firmware made absolutely no difference and I was told to return the unit for yet another replacement. I refused to do so and demanded an advanced replacement which after much cajoling I was granted. About a week later it arrived and I returned the second unit. Today, 12/30/2008 I called about returning this one and was told that I could only be given an RMA online as I was not entitled to free phone support! Here's the catch, the online form won't accept my serial number so I'm unable to submit. Yes, eventually I wrote Customer Support an email and eventually, according to the automated reply, someone will respond within an average of 48 hours. The bottom line here is that the products are junk and perhaps the only thing worse is the customer service. Save yourself some money and some aggravation and buy a Zune or something else.</review>

<review id="7259">This is an over-hyped series. It tells the personal stories of John and Abigail Adams very well and in considerable detail. However, overall the series does not live up the promotions as an action-packed, tension-filled drama of the birth of the nation and the first years of the Republic.  A true virtue of the series is that it is not chocked full of vulgar language. So, it is possible for HBO to do work that is not excessively pandering to the lowest common denominator. Still the presentation lacks coherence from one segment to the other and from one episode to the other. It may be good personal history but it is not good entertainment.The central problem with this series is that it covers far too much time using far to little film for far too much personal detail. It is devoid of overall theme, flow and action. In fact, if you have seen the 30 second ad for the series on MSNBC, you have seen all the action in the entire series. The cinema, sets and costumes are worthy. The actors work well in their roles but the whole story line is disjointed and often creates hardly more than a series of moments of pregnant silence. I guess that makes it authentic in portraying the New England character, but that should not take ten hours or so to communicate. Besides, all we need is Thornton Wilder for that dark task.A careful psychological study of the Adam's family life could be forgiven if the big ideas of the times were more in play. We get a glimpse, but only a fleeting glimpse, of some of the most dramatic events of Western History. This is a screenplay for the head, but not for the spirit. It conveys the idea of a rather common man thrust into a series of rather uncommon roles. I assume this director is dramatically inspired by Stanley and Blanche, but not by Paine and Rousseau.Unless you hang on every word written about the private lives of the founding fathers, spend your time more wisely if you are looking for an overall sense of the American Revolution. You will not find the fire in the belly and the smoke in the air. You will get a rather gloomy feeling of an age dark with self doubt, but you will not be inspired by the visions of independence and rebellion.  The depictions of the creation of the Declaration of Independence, for example, would have you believe that Thomas Jefferson was insecure and that the rest of the delegates had little to contribute. You are to believe the sagacious Franklin and the venerable Adams rescued the self-doubting Hamlet-like Jefferson from the pettiness and venality of all the others.  As a glorification of John Adams and his personal prejudices the series works. Yet it does little justice to Hamilton and others, while failing as a depiction of the genius of the age and the flowering of the Enlightenment. The production sacrifices the whole story for the episodic details of the person of John Adams.  That is certainly a permissible topic, just not wholly accurate as to the big picture, and not entertaining in the way the promotion leads one to believe it will be.</review>

<review id="7260">Let me make myself clear that I am an avid reader and a HUGE fan of the Twilight series. I found the first novel, Twilight, to be a beautiful love story so inspiring and unusual that it blew me off my feet. The relationship between Bella and Edward seemed very different, and I found one chapter in particular in the first book allowed me to become entranced by the two lovers. Bella Swan comes to Forks leaving sunny Arizona to find herself on an alien green planet where it rains every day. At her new High School she finds herself perplexed by the Cullen family, which we then discover to be Vampires. Edward Cullen and Bella Swan fall madly in love. A love so passionate it could put Romeo and Juliet to the test. Eclipse is the third novel in the series. After looking at a few reviews and acknowledging the rating of the novel I began to have my doubts. Many people found the book to be the best of the series or found it entrancing. While some reviewers were immensely disappointed. It is very difficult for an author to create a third novel that will live up to the first novel's expectations and in my opinion Stephanie Meyer did not truly deliver. This is understandable since many authors cannot even write a decent sequel, which Meyer managed to do. The second novel New Moon was almost as good as the first. The middle part, to be quite honest was a little boring, but none the less kept me going. But Stephanie Meyer had so many expectations to live up to it is understandable that it wouldn't be easy. The third book begins with Bella and Edward discussing college with Charlie , who has just released Bella from the house. The novel continues to mention Bella's choice to join Edward forever and her relationship with Jacob Black. Stephanie Meyer has mentioned many times that she found Jacob to be her favorite character and after reading this novel I found myself disliking him more then I did in the second novel. The Edward-Jacob-Bella love triangle continues to play out through all the 626 pages in which the reader will want to throw the book on the floor because they are so annoyed with how stupid Bella truly is. I have never personally liked how Bella is always portrayed as the damsel in distress and I found that part of her character a bad influence for young women who might otherwise look up to her. Many feminists would be appalled at how Bella reacts. She makes herself vulnerable and at one point in the book she even says, "IF YOU LEAVE ME I'LL DIE." Which I found to be  silly and very sexist.  I understand that the traditional love story is that the damsel is rescued by the man but at least one love story should not have that stupid shallow idea. This book was by far the most inappropriate  in that sense since Bella is manipulated heavily by Jacob in such I cruel way I wanted to grab Stephanie Meyer and ask her why she took pleasure in writing such a sexist book. The book is the poorest written of the three books. I have never considered Stephanie Meyer an excellent writer but she does tell a great story that makes the reader want to turn the page to see what is coming next in the story. The whole story seems rushed even though the novel is indeed 626 pages. It seems the publisher may have hurried her to write so it is a little sloppy. I also noticed many typos throughout the novel. The characters are extremely one dimensional. Even Edward seemed too dramatic and fake with his passion for Bella. I cannot recall a single sentence he spoke to her that didn't have the word love, honey,sweet, darling or something sappy like that. Edward also lost his cocky sexy arrogance that I loved. He was obsessed with Bella in an unnatural way that disturbed me. His character was completely different. Jacob became such a nasty manipulator I was surprised that Edward didn't sink his teeth right into his neck. All Edward ever said was "If you're happy Bella, I'm happy." - please give me a break! Bella became a shallow even more selfish girl. She became so confused with her emotions I almost pitied her because Meyer had robbed Bella of the strength that made her such an interesting character in the first book. Rosalie, Alice, Emmett and Jasper were also turned into different characters all of which seemed out of character from the first two books.The first two books were amazing and inspiring. The true love that possessed Bella and Edward left after book two. I feel this new book is incomplete. I do not think I will buy the fourth book. I'll borrow it from the library, and if I could I would go return this book. This book is no longer a love affair so deeply passionate between a Vampire and a human. It is now about having to make choices when you should already know what the right answer is. I started this review with mixed opinions but now as I conclude I find myself so disappointed I shall try to remember the Edward and Bella I know from the first novel, Twilight, keeping those characters who are so deeply in love nothing could tear them apart.Stephanie Meyer I'm afraid you disappointed a true Twilight fan till the very end. My only hope is that you can rekindle the beautiful story you had with Edward and Bella in Twilight. Good luck on the next book, I hope it's an improvement! If a movie is ever to be made may it only be the movie of Twilight. Goodbye Edward and Bella. I'll miss you!</review>

<review id="7261">We've been using Pampers baby dry for some time, however Huggies seemed to be a little cheaper.  We made the switch and ordered 3 boxes.  Unfortunately, the diapers caused my boy to develop a bad diaper rash.  We tried ointments with no luck.  We bought a small pack of Pampers to see if it could be the diapers and sure enough the rash started to look better in a few days.  He's since been rash free.  I feel this is mostly due to the way the Pampers absorb fluids as well as draw them aware from the skin.  If you have a sensitive skin baby, try Pampers and avoid the Huggies.  Also, the Pampers tend to fit a little better, helping to eliminate leaks.</review>

<review id="7263">This gamepad was a replacement for my trusty Logitech Wingman Rumblepad, which died after a few years of service. I wanted to like this pad--I really, really did. Modeled after the highly successful Dual Shock controller, minus vibration functions, this pad looked and felt great. Response time was excellent, and it was always a breeze to use in my favorite games and emulators--for 3 months.Then, I began to have a problem. Occasionally, my aim/movement/menu selections would begin pulling up and to the left. The problem was sporadic, and did not seem affected by updating drivers or trying the unit on different computers (or even clean installs of Windows XP). The problem would just go away for a while, then come back.One month later, the problem became permanent, rendering the controller useless. At the time, there was almost no information on the internet about the defects, and I chalked it up to bad luck. Thanks to Amazon and a few other sites, a disturbing scenario has emerged: not only is this product defective, it continues to be sold to unsuspecting consumers.To all the reviewers who just don't understand why people are reviewing this game pad negatively, it is simple--about half of the people on here received defective units. I am genuinely glad that you got lucky, or that your pad hasn't died yet, but I cannot recommend a product with such a high failure rate to anyone.Shame on Logitech for ignoring this obvious design problem and continuing to defraud consumers by selling a defective product. They should change the product name to Logitech *Disposable* Dual Action Game Pad USB.</review>

<review id="7266">I have had the worst experinece of my life when dealing with this router and the company Linksys.  The writing on the box said that it handled pass thru VPN.  This is important to me becasue I use a laptop from work when telecommuting.  I went from a Netgear Router to this Linksys router.  Decided to upgrade to wireless when I found out that my old Netgear was not working correctly any more.  Once I plugged the Linksys in my problems started.  I couldn't get to my outlook any more.  I talked to the Tech's with no success and could hardly understand them when they talked over the phone.  I got an RMA number to send the Linksys Router back for replacement.  When I received the replacement it was used and when I plugged it in it didn't work.  I was so frustrated I threw in the garbage and went down and bought the new D-Link router.  Thank you D-Link.  Everything is great again.  I will never buy another Linksys product again.</review>

<review id="7267">This review is from: Australia (DVD)      The story line was interesting at times.  The acting had some high points.  Other than that, not good.  The "artistic" (?) use of superimposing the actors was confusing.  I guess it was supposed to look fake and "Wizard of Oz" like.  I didn't get it.  It was overly hyped.  I fell asleep.</review>

<review id="7268">Stephenie Meyer will never make anyone's list of great writers; her gift was storytelling, an ability that is often derided in favor of more high falutin' literary pleasures, but one that is an absolute must if the novel is to grant the reader any satisfaction. Twilight was a classic example of good storytelling, and New Moon wasn't bad, either. With each successive book in the -- I always have to stop myself from saying "trilogy" b/c that's what this was apparently intended to be and frankly, should have been -- series, however, the storytelling got less and less involving and the plot devices to clue us in on the lush world and rich characters that Meyer created became more and more tiresome... e.g., long tales of vampire and werewolf -- sorry, Jacob, "shape-shifter" -- legends explained to dear Bella, because she was always the ignorant one in any assemblage of the main characters. I wonder: did Meyer ever give us the backstory in the absence of one of Bella's queries? With "Breaking Dawn", I was disturbed not by the imprinting (a strange concept but one that I merrily accepted, since the only other  interpretation of this unnatural attachment to a baby as a potential mate was obviously NOT Meyer's intention) or the neat "conclusion" to Bella and Edward's love story (I'll be looking for a story starring Nessie, Jacob, and the Brazilian half-breed in a few years). I was hoping that Meyer would somehow be able to thwart the Volturi (great name; it even sounds evilly vampiric)and find a way for Bella and Edward to live and love together without her becoming a vampire herself, the aging process of humans notwithstanding. Bella's choice, to willingly embrace a life of blood-drinking (so she kills animals instead; she still has to drink BLOOD to "live"!), and lose her SOUL in the process, was despicable! I don't care WHO the guy is, even my dearly adored husband, there's no way I would ever even consider joining the permanent nightlife just to be with him. The one thing she got right (sort of) was investing Bella with the kinds of gifts that we could actually see her bringing into her new "life", despite Bella's inability to do anything well except cook as a breathing being. On the other hand, I tsk-tsked the night away when I read the descriptions of Bella's awesome vampire power and got visions of Famke Janssen in X-Men. I hated "The Host", Meyer's non-Twilight offering released earlier this year. Perhaps if she had spent less time on her first "adult" novel", Bella, Edward, Jacob, and the readers would have gotten what they deserved -- a better ending.</review>

<review id="7270">I read lots of wonderful reviews, but only one about this issue.  It seems if you "bump" your computer around too much, then the hard drive (which is a spinning disk) gets out of place. So first bit of advice is not to save anything (that you need) on the computer. I don't usually but hadn't backed it up yet today.  Because the solution to the problem is to do a system recovery. How do you know this happens? Your computer will start up show the opening screen and then immediately shut down.  I called the acer company and they said if I want the data off the computer I will have to go to a computer tech support to recover my data then recover the whole system.  So I guess its not a problem if I didn't have that one program I needed files from.Otherwise before this happened today, I was really enjoying the portable, light-weight and speed of the computer.  The keyboard is easy for me, but others who have used it seem to struggle with the mouse (if you move your finger in a swirl motion it shrinks the text on the screen).  Good Luck!</review>

I read the instructions and other peoples advice to keep using it and "I'd get used to it." That never happened (even after a few weeks), I just find it extremely uncomfortable. I wish I could tolerate it better because I love the cleaness my teeth feel, but I can't stand the vibration strength.</review>

<review id="7275">I had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed. A fully-charged battery lasts 50 minutes which is not enough time for a guy like me who's only moderately hairy. It takes many, many times of shaving over a spot to get the hair neatly trimmed, and even then sometimes it just won't work. As far as shaving (as opposed to trimming) the groin area safely, it doesn't work very well and the exposed cutting edges at both sides of the foil can cut if you're not careful.The Norelco Accuvac, which Amazon sells for the same price, is much sturdier and trims body hair much faster and more neatly; it has 9 settings which are changed by turning a dial, as opposed to the cumbersome and hard-to-change 3 plastic attachments that come with the Bodygroom. As far as shaving the groin area, trim with the Accuvac and then use a new style razor such as the Gillette M3 Power or Venus Vibrance; they give a much closer shave and are almost impossible to cut your privates with!</review>

<review id="7276">This review is from: Transporter 3 [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)      Transporter is such an amazing film, a real surprise, great timing, interesting story, and just the right amount of action. Fast forward to version 3, and everything just feels wrong.The opening 10 or 15 minutes pack some interesting story line, decent action, that car crashing through Frank's living room wall was incredible. From there the film just goes down hill. The real turning point, Frank starts talking to Valentina (breaks his rule about the cargo), and she refuses to speak (invoking his rule about not talking). Finally she talks about food at a restaurant. It's foreshadowing, but she does talk about carrots a lot. And sadly the only thought this reviewer and his two sons had was, well does that help her keep her red hair and freckles? Sad but true, the movie just completely lost it's way at this point.The action scenes are exciting and pitiful at the same time. The excitment is in the chase and the rapid fire editing, slick cars, beautiful scenery, and pulsating music and sound. The awful part, and this absolutely kills these sequences, so much sped up motion was used as to make these scenes almost stupid. Sped up and slo-mo fighting scenes were tiresome. The worst was the driving on two wheels between the two semi's stunt - plain old, flat out, stupid, defying all laws of physics and the darn CG effect was too obvious. It's a sad movie when the viewer can actually see the light green tint around the edge of the actors in front of a green screen (just about every in car conversation is plagued with this). If the action had been furious enough, the dialog compelling, the story interesting; the green screen effect would have faded away. Instead it's out there in the open, made even visible on Blu-Ray.There's a ton of continuity issues, where things don't match from one scene to the next. Frankly, this reviewer has never seen a longer list for any other movie that that internet movie database. T 3 has probably set a record for the most (there are over 30 goofs). Natalya Rudakova is just not a very good actress, her delivery of lines is flat and almost read from the script. She is not really that beautiful, certainly not somebody that Frank should be attracted to. The reviewer found himself noticing the dark marks on her lips, either cold sores or freckles. It's very sad when a lead actress just isn't captivating. Jason Statham is the only reason this film gets two stars. This is essentially a guy movie, not really a date film. Jason taking his shirt off several times, well just wasn't a smart move; it plays to the wrong audience. The fishing scene with the French police inspector is charming. Him driving an old Renault 6 is also an interesting contrast. The other characters are just flat.The film is rated PG-13. There is no nudity. The f bomb is in a subtitle once. There's plenty of violence, a fair amount of blood, and several times where a person is shown being shot. Given that the movie is so bad, it's probably smart to respect the age guideline. Blu-Ray was a mixed blessing for this film. The sound is incredible. It will excercise your subwoofer. The gun shots and fighting sounds are significantly higher volume than the dialog. The high resolution of Blu-Ray shows all the bad / cheap CG effects the director chose. On DVD, these might not have been as visible. The Blu-Ray disc includes some really lame Mogolo (apologies for not spelling this correctly) piece of junkware software. It took a good solid 15 minutes (at 12Mbps very fast internet connection) to download the program. It appears to allow a person to view a clip of the film, store it, add some graphics, and then share it with others. After step 12 in the demo, this reviewer gave up totally. Cr__ware experiments just keep happening with Blu-Ray. Maybe one day soon the authors of this junk will settle down to just show the movie in all it's HiDef glory.</review>

I hauled the keyboardinto work and hook it up (what a pain!)and yup the keyboard is junk. Logitech's customer support had me fill out a bunch of info but I didn't have my receipt so I'm out my 80$, I went back to my old keyboard, its 10 years old and still works perfectly! Logitech should be ashamed of them selves for selling substandard products at inflated prices! No matter how many bells and whistles a keyboard has it should last longer then 8 months!I have an update- I worked with a very nice customer support person at Logitech and even without my receipt they worked with me to get a replacement keyboard! That's the good, the bad is that the new keyboard is the newer G15 and it seams to be a shadow of the original g15 that I had. I liked the flip up screen and disc volume control, the larger keys/keyboard. Everything about this new g15 is just less then the original G15 and I don't think they should be calling it a G15.</review>

<review id="7280">Our family has used the Oral-B power toothbrushes for several years now. The original model lasted a good 3+ years with heavy use. We bought this model as a replacement, but it lasted not much more than a year. It simply stopped working one day. Judging by the moisture that was getting into the LED screen, I suspected that it suffered a short. Thinking that it was just a defective unit, we went out and bought the same model. This time, it came with two of the power toothbrushes. In less than 6 months use, one of the brushes has already died. It suffered the same problem as the first, with moisture getting inside the brush. One would expect a toothbrush to be waterproof. It's very apparent that these brushes are not. It's a shame because they do a very effective job of cleaning teeth. I will be looking at alternatives now.</review>

During the E-file process, TurboTax checks your return for errors.  On my return, it claimed that I submitted a blank W-2.  I knew that wasn't true, but had to proceed.  TT brought up my W-2 and the first box I filled in was my income.  I hit the tab key and all the rest of the fields filled in automatically.  OK, so I proceed on only to discover that TT had doubled my income and E-filed my return as an adjusted return with the new income.  Instead of receiving $3200.00 in refunds, TT says I owe $21,000 in taxes!  I attempted to contact TT but they ignored me.  I have had to file two amended returns.  It won't be until mid June before California gets to my amended return.  They want their money now and are threatening to put a lien on my house if I don't pay.  The Federal hasn't even processed my return yet.  As a result, I won't get a stimulus check until they do.  All TT did was refund my money for the E-file.  If TT screws up on you Intuit WILL NOT HELP YOU!  Again, DO NOT E-FILE USING TURBO-TAX!!!!!</review>

<review id="7287">Am I the only one having this problem?  These foils aren't lasting me more than a few months.  And, no, I don't push the razor hard against my face, I use it at a 90 degree angle, and I don't have an abnormally thick beard.  I've used Braun razors my whole life and for some reason my 8595 goes through foils like nothing else.  I've even had the entire cutter unit (motor) replaced under warrenty just in case that was the problem.

For everyone else, it will be a stone cold snooze. Ridiculous, shallow, silly, childish and ultimately boring beyond belief. It is also by turns sadistic, cruel, mean spirited and filled with dark psycho babble that passes for profundity if, as mentioned, you are twenty something and hopped up on testosterone.This film received such great reviews, and did such huge business, first in theaters and now on disc, that I felt I should at least give it a try.

<review id="7294">I was not expecting miracles with this product...I simply wanted an inexpensive way to record short videos mainly for use on my computer or YouTube. I have a Sony digital camera which does an average job with videos, but after reading all the 5-star reviews on Amazon, I decided to purchase the Flip Ultra.Many of the reviews here state issues with the Flip software locking up, but I felt reassured after reading from Flip that there is a firmware update which resolves this. I DID successfully update the software prior to uploading videos to my computer and am STILL experiencing issues.First off, I have a brand new Dell laptop that is running Windows Vista. However, Flip has stated that the recent firmware update has resolved the  software issues---even with Vista. The issues I am still experiencing:- The software will lock up. It DOES allow me to pull the videos from the Flip to my computer, but once there, the playback is either very slow or does not work at all. I will hit the "play" button and it freezes. I took 3 videos today that I can not watch because it will freeze.- Simply navigating through the Flip software menu is tedious. It takes extremely long (if it doesn't freeze up completely) to select the different videos, to go between the movie maker to the sharing options, etc. Extremely frustrating.- The movie-making software (again, when it works--sometimes the result would be a blank movie that will not play) will automatically truncate my videos to 20 seconds in length. I'm not sure if this is how it's supposed to work, but I doubt it.- Video quality is rubbish. Again, I was NOT expecting perfect, crisp videos that I would get on an expensive camcorder---just better than my digital camera. It looked fine on the Flip's tiny screen, but once on my computer there were lines in the video, blurriness and a general "rough" look. Even when I filmed in bright lighting. Once I uploaded these videos to YouTube, the quality diminished even further. My Sony digital camera does a better job.- The recording button is annoying (need to press firmly)  and the zoom is useless (I expected that for the price) but I could get around that if the product worked.- USB was hard to insert in the ports on my computer---felt like it was a tight fit. Also, the way the ports are arranged on my laptop, I cannot have the Flip plugged in and my power adapter connected at the same time (annoying, but I can get over that too).The pro's:- Small, cute (I got the pink) and easy to carry with you anywhere.- Easy to use (when the software works).- I like the ability to directly upload videos to YouTube.I am hoping that my unit is defective (since there are so many 5-star reviews, I am hoping this is the case??) and have requested that Amazon exchange it for a new one.</review>

<review id="7295">I do not even know where to begin.  This woman barely talks through the whole video so you must keep your eyes on the television at all times to see when she switches movements.  Half of the time she is just in her own little world dancing around and not giving you any direction.  The ab workout is not for anyone with a bad back and there are no modifications.  I am not an expert, but I do not think that these are safe movements the way she is just swinging the weights around.  Did I mention the music in the background is awful!  Don't get roped in because of the stars that use her.</review>

<review id="7296">Well I bought this at Bestbuy with all of the gift cards I received. I have A HD 16.9 TV so I thought this would work great with it. Well let me tell you something. Sony and I believe Panasonic have come up with A new video format, its called AVCHD and guess what? You can only play it back on A blueray disk player. sony has software programs that will convert it to be able to play on A standard DVD player but guess what? 1st off you need to buy the software and 2nd even after converting to the highest setting it still looked grainy. HD? Sure if you have A blue ray player and burner. Sheesh Sony! is this the best you guys can come up with?</review>

<review id="7297">Honestly, a $9 slicker brush took more loose undercoat off my Shelties than the Furminator, with less effort and fuss. In addition, it merely brushed the fur out, rather than cutting it out. Save your money.</review>

<review id="7298">My complaint for these brushes is the poor product design, specifically, with the tips of the biggest and the smallest brushes. To clean around all the sharp corners well, it is important for the tips of these brushes to be covered with a lot of bristles. Guess what, the tip of the smallest brush is prety much dominated by the metal wires, so when you try to clean, instead of getting the bristles to touch and rub against the surfaces, it's mostly the metal wires that come into contact. Last time I checked, it's the bristles that clean, not the metal wire. Same with the biggest brush: The way the metal wires wrap around the sponge tip to hold it to the handle prevents the sponge from coming into full contact with the surfaces.The product designers for the brushes don't deserve to be product designers. Do you know how much it takes to design a simple floor mop? A lot. A good product designer has to think about which yarn absorbs water well, how much water to absorb so the mop won't be hard to wring, what wringing mechanism to use, how long the handle should be, how thick the handle should be, how the mop head comes into contact with the floor, and so forth, in order to maximize ease of use and effectiveness.The designers of the brushes are a failure. It seems that not much thought went into the design. Yes, we are dealing with just brushes, but even brushes should do the job they are supposed to do well.</review>

<review id="7299">I hate shaving with a blade and would pay a lot for an electric razor that would give as close of a shave.  Unfortunately, the Braun 9595, while certainly a good electric razor, doesn't match the closeness of a blade.  With my previous electric razor, I would use it and then shave with a blade for maximum closeness, which I was hoping to avoid with this one.  Between the over $200 price of the blade on top of buying the monthly cleaning cartridges, it's just not worth it.</review>

<review id="7300">This machine is loud.  It is louder than my dishwasher.  And my dishwasher is not a quiet one.  You must chill the container prior to each use. So you can only make one quart-1/2 quarts a day.  Not really enough if you have a family.  Additionally, the resulting product is too soft and must be frozen after churned.  We attempted to eat some immediately after churning, it melted faster than it could be eaten resulting in a bowl of cream.It was disappointing.  After using this machine, which I have returned.  I will be looking for a machine that uses ice and salt, the old fashioned way, the way that actually works.</review>

<review id="7301">I ordered a crepe maker as a gift for a friend for Christmas.  When I hadn't receive it in over a week (it was 3-5 day delivery).  I called the seller.  I was told it hadn't been shipped yet.  Four days until Christmas I asked if it could possibly be shipped overnight (I would pay the additional as I really wanted this item).  The person I spoke to told me he would call the warehouse and get back to me.  He took my phone number. However, guess what?  You got it!  He never called me back.  I called the seller again today.  I was informed that they were out of stock and I would not be receiving my item.  Three days before Christmas...no gift!  This is totally unacceptable.  How could any respectable company do business like that?  I would never order from them again and I suggest no one else order from them. A company that doesn't give you the courtsey of notifing you that an item in not available especially just before Christmas cannot be a reputable company.  Don't order from them!!!!</review>

<review id="7305">I tried to use this hub on my iMac (G4, running OSX 10.3.9) which is clearly within the recommended hardware.   It does not work....When I plug a device into the hub, it is not detected.  I have looked for updated drivers from both Apple and D-Link, I have the most current drivers and it still does not work.I tried several USB devices(iPod, printer, keyboard, mouse...) none showed up in Finder.  However, when I use the low level hardware utility, I can see the hub is detected and the end device ID's are read back.   When I plug these devices directly into the same port on the iMac, they work fine.So, if you have an iMac like mine, you may want to consider a different hub.</review>

<review id="7306">Mine is the simplest of connections -- just a coaxial cable from the wall to the Slingbox.  Sometimes it works within my home network, but I have no real use for that.  Have now reset the device many, many times and reconfigured the modem and the Slingbox each time but, to date, no one, including two different tech support reps on live chat, has been able to make the unit work remotely.  The last rep suggested that I return it.  I cannot return it as it is no longer in "new" condition, so I am out $264.  Apparently new software was released which has major bugs.  There are numerous posts regarding this "update" in the Sling Community forum, including several who report the same errors as I get, but Sling Media does not monitor that forum so there are more questions than answers. Supposedly your router is automatically configured but mine is the most common one used by ATT/Bellsouth and the software cannot configure it.  There is also supposed to be a page at the website that contains info on manual configuration of various routers but that link results in a Page Not Found error.  I could find no other helpful info at the Sling Media website.It's a fascinating concept but definitely not ready for prime time.  If you're determined, at least wait a few months until they finish testing their software on other consumers.</review>

<review id="7309">Based on my experiences and the other reviews, it seems one must be lucky to get a waffle maker that works. The  Cuisinart WMR-CA Round Classic Waffle Maker I received was a disaster from the very first waffle. On our first try, the waffle split neatly in half when we tried to open the waffle maker and stuck to the griddles. We carefully peeled it off, cleaned the griddles, seasoned them with cooking oil, and tried again. Waffle #2 was burnt to a crisp and raw inside. Waffle #3 was a return of waffle #1. We used a faithful old Black & Decker for almost 20 years before it wore out with never a failure, so we're hardly waffle novices. I believe that some people may have gotten waffle makers that worked, but ours wasn't among them. I'd say if you have plenty of time and don't mind packaging up returns and taking them to the post office, go ahead and order one. You might get lucky. Otherwise, keep looking. This waffle maker isn't worth the effort.</review>

<review id="7311">I had this item and it worked great until it broke. The problem is the thumbpad (its not a pad, it's like a mini joystick) on the side. I used this to move around (like AWSD keys) in WoW and the keys for skills. It worked nicely except the thumbpad thing breaks very easily. I sent it back to saitek with an RMA but they never sent me a new one back and I didn't even try to pursue it because I was just so disheartened with it. It does look great though!Bottom line is, if you're going to use the side thumbstick to move around, don't get this one. If you use the keys on top to move around then it should be no problem.The Nostromo thumbpad is an actual pad and so can take a huge beating. It's lasted me through everything. It's built like a tank.</review>

<review id="7312">For people who have used Microsoft Office for the past 10 years, Office 2007 is hellish to use.  On their Office Web-Site, Microsoft has put an animation that users may use to locate items of basic functionality in Office 2007.  Click the menu item in an Office 2003 menu (menu - hmmm now that's interesting) - and an animation will show you where to find it in 2007.  The fact that this is even necessary should tell you somthing.  I don't want to spend hours learning a product I have used for the past 10 years - I have work to do.This product was not released to the public but rather inflicted on the public.  I cannot in any shape, form or fashion recommend Office 2007 or Vista.  These products are total assaults on productivity.</review>

<review id="7321">After stellar performance of the parent dual-band WRT600T router with my plain jane laptop some 50 feet removed - and the exciting image of the happy family computing all over a multi-story house on the box - I purchased this multi-band wireless receiver to join the cheerful crowd. Not so! Had hoped to 'unwire' my cabled net of 3 desktops for neater appearance; surely not with this underperforming weakling.Using a big Dell (XP/SP3), the vaunted automatic link with the router failed - even after placing the antenna within 3 feet of the router. Laborious manual installation, though eventually succesful, was a pain; not helped a bit by differing terminology for arcane topics between master unit and slave receiver. The final signal at a desktop less than 30 feet away, separated by a thin plaster wall (no hindrance to laptop reception) was just 2-to-3 wavering bars ("weak"), and switching to the 5 GHz band required tedious reentry of the 16-digit security code.A dual antenna USB plugin receiver sounds like an ideal solution for interconnecting desktops in a Wi-Fi environment -- but this premature release needs a lot more work before being ready for prime time. And online help is an annoying 'Catch-22', without direct email link to tech support. Shame on Linksys for not matching its outstanding router to this prematurely released underachiever. Better off to get a generic unit at half the price.Oh, and not so by the way, this unit installs only only a PC. On my MacPro it went totally unrecognized - further negating any chance of one happy computing family. Two stars for 2-out-of-5 reception bars underperformance.</review>

<review id="7322">Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn PopperI have been using this popcorn popper for years.  I bought a new one after mine was falling apart after many years of use.  The new one is made of FOIL.  Believe me when I tell you that a flip top can has more tin than this popper. The gears are now made of plastic.  Any resistance and it will break.  The gear popped off the first use because there was a small amount of resistance stirring the popped corn. Even the instructions tell you not to get this pot too hot because the metal will melt.  That should tell you something.  Spend more money and get a REAL "all metal" popper. Don't waste your money on this one.</review>

<review id="7324">This review is from: Quantum of Solace [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)      The first of the Craig 007 movies was excellent all round: solid script, superior acting (for the genre) and outstanding direction and camerawork.  This second episode is atrocious.  It is difficult to exaggerate just how feeble this movie truly is.  Starting with the context-free car chase (Wow! A car chase! How original!) through to a disjointed rooftop chase - which must have been more interesting to make than it is to watch - through to an airplane chase... ho hum, another day, another chase to endure.  The problem is that without a real story and without pausing to let us get close to what the actors are trying to do, it's all just random noise and silly sequences.  Bang, boom, thud - and that's the sound of the audience slamming the doors on the way out of the theater or falling from their chairs in a catatonic trance.The second unit camerawork is pathetic - all jumpy cuts and disjointed sequences that rob the frenetic action scenes of any emotional interest and for some people may actually induce a migraine.  The script is flat. This movie feels like it was cobbled together from a third-rate video game.  The producers should have looked at the rushes early on and have replaced both the director and the second unit director post haste.  As it is, a lot of money was squandered to no good effect.  The only positive thing to say about this dire effort is that at least it is fairly short.We can only hope the third in the Craig series of Bond movies involves a director who is capable of producing something more than this amateurish juvenile film-school type of montage.  There's a world of difference between compelling and innovative camera work with tight edits and a disjointed mess of sound and fury that signifies nothing.  Much better to save your money and instead spend it on a copy of the totally excellent Il y a longtemps que je t'aime, even though you'll have to purchase it via amazon.fr because the US site doesn't stock it.</review>

<review id="7326">The image is nice and it works great right out of the box (after charging).  However, it is a challenge to edit, especially if you want to use a 3rd party software.  The MP4 format can be converted to other, but only if you search for the conversion software and hope to find a freeware version or cheap program that will do that.  It would seem easy to add this to the software in the camera, but it just makes using it on a PC a bit tougher unless you want to upload to YouTube, not really edit like you could in Move Maker or Windows Media.  After playing around a couple of hours with this, I'm a bit disappointed, especially after such rave reviews for others on line and in person.</review>

<review id="7332">I'm a young guy with excessive body hair problems (back, upper arms, shoulders, etc.) I've used hair trimmers for a long time to deal with the problem, mainly corded hair clippers or cordless sideburn trimmers to get the bulk off, and then using a razor with cream to get smooth.I had heard about Philips BodyGroomer, was amused by the website, and I received one for Xmas. I let it charge for two days, read the instructions, and let the girlfriend have a go with it on my back.Now, this is coming from a guy who tried waxing his back a couple times. This device actually hurts MORE.At first, I thought she was using it wrong. We tried it on my upper arms to make sure. It pulled and yanked and was extremely unpleasant. Even on patches of shorter hair, it was painful. I didn't dare use it on my nether-regions as the advertisements suggest.It was so painful, I finally grabbed it from my girlfriend and threw it against the floor, where it burst into shards of plastic and metal components. They are now serving a higher purpose as landfill material.I cannot recommend this product. I'd like to see the snarky gentleman in the website promotion actually use the product himself, and see if that smirk stays on his face for long.</review>

<review id="7334">I received the mixer along with an attachment package direct from KA.  Upon opening I found attachment shaft bent and beaters would not stay on shaft as something was missing.  Also found the UPS sticker over top a sticker with someone else's name and address.  I felt that the unit had been returned and reshipped without someone checking it out.  When I contacted KA customer service they were frightening.  Told me they would replace but backorder situation would take weeks or months.  I asked for return for refund.  They agreed, but after two weeks with no pickup made, I contacted again.  Kay at KA customer service told me no pickup had been scheduled nor would it as they only replace equipment under the warranty.  Told me I could ship back at my own expense if I chose.  I promptly packed and shipped back to them with tracking.  Cost me $48.00 which I will never recoup.  Nor will I recoup the originally shipping charge of $25.00 they added to my bill to send me the broken unit and attachment.  So for the "pleasure" of doing business with Kithenaid it cost me $73.00 and I have nothing to show for my money.  Kitchenaid is nothing more than a scam front.  They sell and ship broken mixers that they know or should know are not working.  I could have used the money to purchase another brand that does work out of the box.  Be real careful dealing with Kitchenaid.  They are no longer owned by the same people who built quality mixers years ago.  Like so many good American brands they were sold off to quick buck artists who are recouping their investment by hook or by crook.  I don't know who curently owns Kitchenaid, but it isn't Hobart any longer.  In fact Hobart still makes high quality mixers that work well and last forever and compete directly with the company they started called Kitchenaid.  Buyer beware.</review>

<review id="7337">My wife bought this gadget for my birthday and I have used it for about 6 months.  It is the latest in a line of vibrating clippers, with this one having a new wrinkles, that it is waterproof and has a light, or so Panasonic claims.  I have no reason to doubt it is waterproof, but I have never tested immersing it in the sink. I also don't see the reason for the light.  The bathroom is the most brightly lit room in my house.  My complaint with this device is the same as all the others. It doesn't do much of a job and takes a long time to do what it does. It doesn't cut closely. It doesn'cut all the hair.  It is a device that has basically the same head and cutting components of an electric razor and doesn't cut nearly as closely.  As long as they use the relatively thick tubular head with cutting blades agitating beneath the relatively few slots the hairs might slip into, the device will not be much and not worth the money.  Only wives who hate their husband's nose and ear hair will buy them, hoping to cure a rainy day.  In the end, the husband will end up using his razor to get a clean cut in the ears, or suffer with the lousy job the trimmer does.  And, they will get cut.  Time to rethink this device me thinks.</review>

<review id="7338">I'm giving this product two stars instead of one because, for all the reasons other reviewers have named, this is the cream of the epilator crop.  If you're going to try one, this is the one to try.  And if, like me, you decide epilation just isn't for you, you still have an electric razor to use (I use it to shave the back of my boyfriend's neck between hair cuts, and I've also used the trimmer attachment to trim the hair "down there").Despite its high quality, though, I'm giving this product *only* two stars because after six months of use, I'm going back to shaving daily in the shower.  The reasons:(1) Despite daily exfoliation and using a lotion with alpha-hydroxy in it, my legs are still covered in red bumps from ingrown hairs.  I have very fine, thin hair -- so fine and thin that you can't even see it on my arms unless you look very closely -- and maybe that's part of why I'm having such a problem with ingrowns.  I suspect that with coarser hair, it might "poke through" the skin easier as it grows, so you might have fewer ingrowns than I did.(2) It hurts.  I've been a waxer in the past, both salon and at-home, and I would rate the pain from this higher than the pain associated with waxing.  The big difference is that the waxing pain is a quick thing, a zip and it's done, while using this product requires repeatedly and intentionally inflicting serious pain on yourself for extended periods of time.  Legs, it's not too bad; underarms, it's bearable most of the time; bikini area, I couldn't stand it long enough to use it.  And I have a pretty high pain tolerance.(3)  It takes a long time.  Granted, I'm 5' 10" tall and have long legs, but it still takes about 30 minutes at a time to do my legs properly.  And who has 30 minutes to do that, really?  It just meant I didn't do it as often as I would have liked.  The directions say that to use it properly, you should take 10 seconds with each pass up 1/2 of your leg (ankle to knee, or knee up).  Try it yourself next time you're shaving your legs:  take a full ten seconds for each pass of 1/2 of your leg, overlapping slightly because the width of the epilator head is slightly smaller than a disposable razor, and see how long it takes you.(4) Despite doing a really careful job, I never even ONCE in SIX MONTHS managed to get truly "silky smooth" legs.  With a razor in the shower, I can come out after 5 minutes and have legs so soft that men never fail to comment on them.  With this thing, it never happened.  Period.(5) Regrowth was much faster than I expected.  You couldn't see it, but you could feel regrowth almost the next day, even on the parts that were smooth immediately after epilation.I'm glad I bought this product because now I know, unquestionably, that epilation is not the answer to my hair-removal needs.  However, I can't wait to go out and buy a razor and shaving cream again.</review>

<review id="7339">I got this hub to use with my Macbook Air.  The hub will reliably "black screen of death" my MBA a few times a day.  Devices that I plug into it include: Sierra Wireless 881 USB for ATT, ipod classic, external bus powered hard drives.  The Sierra Air Card will disconnect randomly when hooked up to the hub as well.  These "features" only happen when the hub is in the mix.  I'd return it but threw out the box.</review>

<review id="7340">I have used the product twice and the animals still have fleas!!  Very disappointed after all the money that was spent.</review>

<review id="7341">I read Twilight and I thought it was fabulous.  I read New Moon - not as good as Twilight, but still quite enjoyable.  Eclipse, however, was... disappointing.  I wouldn't say that I regret the read, because I did enjoy it.  However, in terms of it actually being a good book... well, I'd definitely have to say no to that one.Eclipse delivers us with, of course, the highly enthralling (sort of) and tension-filled (kind of) battle between Edward and Jacob for Bella's heart.  (And I do not count that as a spoiler, because I'm pretty sure we all saw that one coming.)  I personally found a lot of this conflict to be overly dramatic and entirely nonsensical.  Particularly Bella's final decision, which resulted in my pointblank staring at the page, yelling, "Oh, COME ON."  (Yes, I talk to my books.  On a regular basis, in fact.)   Seeing as how this was the main emotional carry of the plot... well, don't get your hopes up.A few further disappointments include:- my wondrous capability to predict essentially EVERYTHING that would happen, at least ten pages before it did- the fact that I finally realized that Bella is the dimmest person I have ever read the mind of- the change in much of Edward's dialogue and actions from being swoon-inducingly romantic and enchantingly classy to being just plain unrealistic (I can't find the exact quote, but I do remember there being something about him flinging a bag of frozen hamburger onto the kitchen counter in a curiously debonair fashion)My one really great thing to say about this book was that it had me laughing all the way through - at least once per page.  Of course, that was because I was laughing at its ridiculousness and predictability, so... maybe not such a good thing.  But that was still why I really enjoyed it, so if you want a good time - yes, go order this from your library.Essentially - the book was mediocre, with a soap-opera romance and a high level of predictability.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, but not at all for the right reasons.</review>

<review id="7343">Because I am a software developer I keep many backups of my work.  I own similar external storage devices from Iomega, Maxtor and WD.  This is not only the slowest of many such devices that I have owned over the years, it is so slow that it is almost useless for making frequent backups.  If you don't mind starting a backup at night and letting it work while you sleep, then it's fine.  Otherwise, forget it.  It's a real dog.  I have an older WD drive that does not have this deficiency, so I don't know what they were thinking when the made this one.</review>

<review id="7345">I read the other reviews and thought they must have been unlucky. So I went out to buy the Logitech Dual Action and it was a great gamepad for about 3 weeks until the left stick started acting weird. I'm playing a lot of Madden NFL 2004 and after every snap my QB moves now to the left even without touching the pad. It sucks and makes this product useless. I deserve it though because I didn't listen to the other reviewers. My advice: DON'T BUY IT!</review>

<review id="7349">I am extremely disatisfied with my Keurig.  I loved the company one and loved this one until after 6 months I had problems.  I called and was told to descale it and if that didnt help it would be replaced.  I did everything and when I called back the tech was rude, acted as if I were an idiot and that it was my fault.  I received this as a gift for Christmas 07 so I do not  have a receipt of purchase and because the serial number says it was manufactured in dec 06 - feb 07 theres nothing that can be done.  When I explained it was a Christmas gift the tech flat out told me I was lieing and it showed purchased dec06-feb07 the next tech explained thats when it was manufactured.I now less than a year after receiving this have a semi working $150 coffee machine taking up spac on my counter.  I am severely dissapointed and will make sure I reccomend NOT to buy an Keurig product its not worth the price when it quits after a few months and nothing will be done about it.</review>

<review id="7351">After asking around about hard disk reliability, I was pointed to Seagate. The drive comes in a very nice package/enclosure. It is easy to install and format, even on a Mac. I never experienced any problems switching the drive from Mac to PC...and then after about three months, the drive just died. No warning, it just wouldn't power up one day. I went online and there is an automated RMA/return form to fill out and within few days a refurbished drive shows up, then you send the dead one back. While this is very easy and convenient...I LOST ALL MY DATA and had to spend hours recreating. My next drive will be a LaCie which gets better reliability scores.</review>

<review id="7352">I was delighted when my copy arrived as I use Office 2007 at work and was hoping that some of the cool features would be in Office 2008 for the Mac.Boy was I disappointed.  The first thing I noticed is that it is essentially only a MINOR update over Office X, essentially only giving the user the ability to read/write the new xml-based formats.Excel suffers from serious LOSS of functionality, even over the previous version of Office X for Mac.  In particular, I cannot create a custom-derived x-axis on charts (aka, 'Category Axis').  In fact, the only type of category axis you can create is one of non-formula-based, static text.  Even if you try to create it that way, then replace this static-text data with real information, the chart will not display it (very bizarre).  In my line of work, this makes Excel 2008 completely useless.  The weird thing is, the product itself can actually manage with charts fine if you create them in *any* other version of Excel (Mac or PC).  You just cannot create them because of the lame interface that they've created to try to be more "mac-like".This 'update' is the result of some freakishly bad product management.  I'm afraid this will have to be returned and only when a patch for this serious issue is released will I even think of coming back.</review>

<review id="7353">The machine makes perfect eggs when you fill it completely.  However, my husband and I do not often eat 8 eggs at a time! Their solution for making less than 8 perfect eggs is to "adjust the water level".  So far, I have tried 4 times to make 4 perfect soft-boiled eggs and 4 times I have made medium-boiled eggs.  I'm a good cook and I'm frustrated with their lack of instructions.  The poacher is the same way.  It makes 4 perfectly poached eggs or less than four medium cooked eggs. It will hard boil any amount perfectly, but I can do that without a machine. Disappointed with Oster's lack of instruction.  Maybe you can figure it out...?</review>

<review id="7355">My 3.5 year old son anticipated recieving Wall-e from Santa for at least 2 months.  As soon as he opened it up on Christmas morning he was ready to  watch it.  Well I'm sad to say that it did'nt keep his attention very long.  A couple days later I asked him if he liked Wall-e and he said, "Yeah, well it's kind of boring."

<review id="7356">I was excited about this toaster at first, until it randomly stopped toasting! The egg portion works fine, but one morning it just wouldn't toast. I also wasn't impressed w/ the hard boiled egg function. Even though I pierced the eggs according to the instructions, they still cracked and oozed outside of the shell. Boiling the eggs the old fashioned way would be much cleaner. I would NOT recommend this toaster unless you want to replace it right away.</review>

<review id="7358">I have owned 3 Kitchenaid stand mixers, starting with the Artisan. I just replaced my 600, Professional, unit because the motor burned out after less than 2 years of use.  While these mixers look good, are easy to operate, and they work well for cake and cookie batter, etc., they are not built rugged enough to handle yeast bread and pizza dough.  The new model 600 I purchased last month has the same problem. I went to make 2 loaves of wheat bread with 6 cups flour, using the dough hook, and setting the mixer speed to number 2 as the manual states but within 3 minutes, the mixer over-heated and shut itself off.  I checked the manual and it said that the mixer has a built in fuse and that the unit would be operational again in 30 minutes.  Great, but what do I do with the yeast dough that needs more kneading?  Of course I had to finish the kneading the old fashioned way, by hand.  I've basically had it with Kitchenaid small appliances.  They are okay for the casual person in the kitchen, but I am turning my attention to the Viking Mixer which is the same price and has 900 watts of motor power as opposed to 575 that the "professional" Kitchaid 600 model offers. For this reason, I do not recommend spending so much money on a mixer that is really not built tough enough for kneading bread and for serious home bakers.</review>

<review id="7359">I purchase a LaCie 1TB Big Disk Extreme (w/USB & Firewire).  Initially I was very impressed with the product.  Packaging is sturdy and all the features seemed to be well thought out.  Within three weeks, one of the internal disks crashed and all the data on the drive had to be recovered by a professional recovery service.  (My fault for not having another backup of some of the data.)I shared this experience with some friends and although not many had used LaCie drives, two LaCie owners had the same experience.  One of them is still using his for a door stop.  I was very pleased with Amazon.com in the way they handled the return.  I couldn't get it back within the 30 day window since it had to be shipped off to a recovery service but they entered an exception and will process a full refund.  If you insist on buying a LaCie drive, make sure you do it through Amazon and have it backed up well.  It's not a drive upon which I'd like to depend.</review>

<review id="7362">I am a Senseo user now for several years.  Got a new job where it's 'Bring your own coffeemaker' and immediately went to buy a Senseo again.  I had the original model with the extra-capcity tank at home, and just like everyone else, had to brew using the the 2-cup button and then the 1-cup button to fill my oversized American mug.    Still, the coffee is good and much cheaper than a whole pot since I am the only coffee drinker in our house.I also have complained frequently about the low spout - no travel mugs and some taller coffee cups won't fit under it.So, I was delighted to see Senseo's apparent answer- the 'Supreme'.  Not only did it have a new 'multiple serving sizes up to 10 oz' feature, but it also had a larger tank and 'adjustable spout for different mug sizes.' WooHoo!!!  Finally the perfect coffee maker!  --NOT--!After unpacking and using it for a while, I realized it was all marketing hype.  Here is what I found (objectively, for all to benefit)1) The 'adjustable spout' is only adjustable DOWN.  I measured both the original and the new spout, and both are 4 9/16 inches from the drip plate to the bottom of the spout.  SURE, it adjusts DOWN to the different mug sizes, but NOT any higher as the marketing words would imply.2) The 'multiple serving sizes' is also a farce.  Using the same mug on both machines, I had to use the 'brew 2 cups' button and then the 'brew 1 cup' button to get the mug to fill up to the same place (both machines produced the same amount of liquid).  Again, a farce.  So, what I can figure is this:  I paid $50 more for a machine that has blue lights instead of red ones.Oh, the quality problems really do exist - read the other reviews carefully (I should have!)  While the "standard" model is sturdy and well-built (including fit-n-finish), it is very true that the tank does not "feel" as snug as it should.  This isn't a functional problem, but it just makes you wonder if the fit isn't quite right, what else is lacking in quality?    **This was my 2nd 'Supreme' model unit** the first had to be replaced by Amazon because the power on button was broken (it wouldn't  turn off) and the boiler unit simply wouldn't heat the water. Senseo customer service and Amazon customer service was great during the exchange, which was handled professionally and promptly.My bottom line?  Buy the original, no-frills model and an extra-capacity tank and get good coffee without spending the extra money.  They both fit the same size mug, and make the same coffee.</review>

<review id="7364">Nothing worked easily with this Router.  I had set up 4 other wireless networks with Netgear and Linksys.  I followed the instructions very precisely. Although the router connected to the Internet, it wouldn't pass the connection to the wire connected computer.  After three calls to Dlink Support, they finally figured that I should change the default IP address of the Router...then it worked.  Next I tried to connect laptops by wireless connection to the router.  I was able to do so if there was no security on the network.  But if I wanted to run WEP or WPA (which is what I wanted) it wouldn't make a complete connection...only a limited connection that wouldn't allow me to use the Internet on the laptops.  After spending three hours with Dlink Support, the technician finally got frustrated because nothing she recommended worked. So she gave me a silly excuse that the Dlink notebook adaptor needed a firmware upgrade.  It didn't...it had the latest firmware.  By the way, the 655 came with firmware 1.02.  I upgraded all the way to 1.11...but nothing could make this sucker work.  I'm sure it connects flawlessly on many systems.  But on mine nothing worked automatically.  In the end I decided to return it.  My system consisted of several Windows XP computers (all with SP2) and a Vista computer. The wired computer was an XP.  I have a Siemens DSL modem and ATT DSL. I think I may have read a post somewhere that this router doesn't work with ATT DSL...so maybe that was it...don't know. Needless to say I went back to my trusty Linksys G router.</review>

<review id="7365">Ugh, this new router is terrible. Without the external antennas, the range is more limited than the Linksys routers with external antennas. While our existing WRT54G and GL routers were a breeze to install, we had a lot of trouble getting the laptops to work with it. We set this one back and purchased a Linksys WRT54GL version instead. The GL works great, but I won't buy anymore of these G2 version routers.</review>

When I was talking to the company rep I was told that this model has a problem with the computer in them. Also was told they had none on hand to send me a replacement.1. Why 24 hours for it to reset??2. Why no machines in stock to replace defective ones? Or even to sell?3.

<review id="7368">I have a friend who uses the Mac version and swears by it. I purchased the PC version and it's certainly interesting. It behaves like no other text editor I've ever seen. Simple operations like cut and paste become strange exasperating games to see what text Final Draft will actually decide to let you cut and paste. I guess it's trying to keep script elements contiguous--but there are times when you just...want...to move...the damn...WORDS. Final Draft makes the mistake of assuming too much.Edit: I hereby redact the rest of my review.

<review id="7371">This is my first ipod. All over, it is a well done product. A lot of cool apps to keep you from boredom. But this ipod as a media player...it's just average or even below average in some cases. My other MP3 player are the Sony Ericsson i750 & Sonly Clie TJ37, they blow this ipod away when it comes to the sound quality. It's hard to believe there's no EQ for ipod Touch, sound quality is flat as the result of all genres play on one flat EQ setting. iTunes 8 is extremely slow on Windows XP doesn't help much neither. Video is cool, instant access to youtube. Once again, lack of video controls. It only has brightness control, no contrast (I might be wrong on this)Pro:- Near perfection integration between iPod & iTune, very easy to use- Display lyrics on screen (if lyric is loaded on iTune)- Superb user interface- Accelerometer really brings fun out of the games, kinda like Wii.- Supports microphone, which enables to use VOIP such as Skype over wifi- A tone of cool apps and a tone of junk appsCons:- Too large and fragile to be an everyday portable MP3 player, unless you have a man bag. lol.  One drop, it is gone. I've dropped my i750 many times and it still rocks. - Average sound quality with no EQ support. What is Apple thinking?- Turtle speed with iTune 8 on Windows XP- Average earphone - expensive accessory. $15.00-30.00 for a piece of thin silicon skin that is made in China?If you want a solid and durable MP3 player, this is not the one for you. But if you want an average MP3 player with lots apps to keep you entertained, then this is a great gadget for you! Update 3/08:Good news, it does have an EQ. Bad news, it is buried in the Setting->Music->EQ.The difference between the EQ settings is barely noticeable, it's better than none.It also a bug, its clock will go crazy when it connects with the PC where iTunes 8 is already running. You have to make sure iTunes 8 is not running on the PC before plug in the USB, otherwise you have to set the clock each time.Apple, iTunes movie rental is a great idea. But $3.99 for 24 hours on a tiny screen? Hmmm...you should have a 0.99 rental for iphone/ipod touch category.</review>

<review id="7372">This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series (DVD)      I purchased this product in a store, on impulse, after seeing it on the discovery channel. My wife and I were entranced by the beautiful music, the soothing voice of Ms. Weaver, and the astonishing videography. What we go was rather different. Mr. Attenboroughs nasal british accent is quite annoying, enough that I think the music is different as well. We watched about 1/2 hour of the first DVD... that was enough. The retail packaging carefully avoids mentioning who the narrator is; classic bait and switch. If you loved the TV version, avoid this DVD. It's nothing like what you are expecting.</review>

<review id="7373">This is my revised review of Norton 360 version 2.0.  I previously had given a positive review and my review was rated as "The most helpful favorable review".  However, after extended use of the product I have to remove my first review and mark this product as DEFECTIVE.  I believe that if the professional review sites that have given this product positive reviews were to run extended trials and followed a policy of revising their initial ratings that they also would drop their ratings after they find that the product starts failing after extended use.I installed the Norton 360 version 2.0 trial edition downloaded from Norton's website and ran it for 13 days on my Windows Vista SP1 PC before activating it. During that time my system did not have any noticeable computer slowdowns and it ran in the background without any need for intervention.  It also ran just fine for another 7 days after purchasing a license and activating it.Sounds great, right?  Well, in my second week of owning it, Norton 360 v2 suddenly started having "Service Framework" failures and told me I should reboot my PC to ensure stable operation.  I found that I better heed the warning and reboot, because my Quad core PC with 3 GB of RAM would turn into a brick that barely functioned. This is really, really annoying when you are in the middle of doing something and suddenly you have to interrupt your work to reboot the computer... oh and saving your work takes about 10 times as long since the computer suddenly doesn't want to function.  I went through tech support and they had me try a lot of different fixes, including doing a complete uninstall and reinstall of the product. Doing a reinstall actually seemed to make things better for a few days and then suddenly Norton 360 decided it was time to start failing at random intervals again.  I looked on message boards and found that some people claimed that there might be a corrupt file on your system that Norton was scanning and failing on.  The problem with that claim is that is 1) Reinstalling the product and doing a "comprehensive" scan didn't cause a failure so I don't think that is really the root cause and 2) even if that was the root cause, if a security product like Norton is going to crash when it finds a corrupt file, then exactly what value does the product provide?  Do you really want to go on a witch hunt for corrupt files on your computer every few days when Norton starts failing on you?BOTTOM LINE: I wish I could recommend the product, but I CANNOT RECOMMEND.  It simply is DEFECTIVE.  When it works, it works great, but it is NOT STABLE and I believe that any installation of it WILL EVENTUALLY START CRASHING EVEN IF IT SEEMS TO WORK AT FIRST.If you decide to buy anyway, here are a few notes:- By default eavesdropping protection is turned off. You can enable it via the settings page. I saw in a professional review that they really recommended turning this feature on.- You need to ensure that any other virus or firewall programs that you have installed are fully uninstalled before installing this product. Having multiple competing products installed can really mess up your system. I used the Norton removal tool from their web site to fully remove the trial version of Norton Internet Security that I was using prior to installing this software.- If you are uncertain about this product, download the free trial from symantec first, but note that my problems with the product didn't show up until about day 20 of having it installed.- If you choose to download the full version of the software from symantec, they place a copy of the full version under C:\ProgramData\Symantec Temporary Files on Windows Vista. Just grab a copy of the software and back it up. This way you don't have to pay to have an "extended download period". Or just keep a copy of the trial version around since it allows you to activate it using the product key that the symantec store gives you.- If you are deciding between purchasing the shipped package from Amazon or Symantec, I would choose Amazon in a heart beat. Amazon customer service rocks. You also could probably download the trial version from symantec, buy the package from Amazon, and then just enter the product code from the Amazon package in the trial software once the Amazon package arrives.</review>

<review id="7374">My dog (Cairn Terrier mix) had terrible side effects from this medication.  Not only did he scratch his back to the point where it bled, but he acted completely bizarre for approximately 6 days -- my dad called him the LSD dog. He was jumpy and paranoid and just seemed miserable and haunted.After I returned the remainder of the medication to the vet, I told him what had happened and he said he'd never heard any other complaints about Advantix, but after a quick search of the internets, I realized I was not alone. Bayer needs to put a warning on this product -- if your dog experiences any side effects, bathe him/her *immediately* using Dawn liquid detergent.Clearly every dog is different. The good reviews are from people whose dogs did not have a bad reaction, but if you've never used it before, why take the chance when you have other options? I have since switched to Frontline Plus with no problems. (We used Revolution in the past, which was fine, but it is not effective against ticks.)</review>

<review id="7375">Our family enjoys many Disney movies (Mulan, Peter Pan, Fox & the Hound, Robin Hood, Sword in the Stone, etc.), but Little Mermaid is terrible!  I can't believe this plot was developed anytime after 1950.  16-year-old mermaid "falls in love" with prince after seeing him once (never actually speaks with him), gives up everything (family/talent/etc.) to see him again.  If you are looking for a strong female role model, watch Mulan - it is amazing.  If you are looking for a girl-gets-prince movie, watch Cinderella - it is a classic.</review>

<review id="7377">The 2009 Quicken Basic will only import files from Quicken 2008 (in the fine print).  This is apparently not a technology problem, because if you spend $30 extra for the deluxe version, you can import files from Quicken 2007 and earlier. This policy seems to be derived from the same stealthy-price-increase thinking that was used on the new Turbotax edition wherein initially it had a limitation of doing only a SINGLE tax return.  Intuit finally reversed themselves on that one, but check out the opinions of long-term Intuit customers on the Amazon tax-software Turbtax forum(over 225 negative comments)!</review>

<review id="7378">This review is from: Eclipse Special Edition (The Twilight Saga) (Hardcover)      I put off reading this book for a a year or more, although I bought it pretty soon after it came out. After the fiasco of Bella's character in New Moon, I had lost some of my trust in Stephenie Meyer's ability to make me like her characters.This book had a great start. Even though there wasn't a lot of action, there was some relationship development and hints being made at future danger.But as the book dragged on, I removed myself further and further from Bella. How can I sympathize with a person whose entire existence depends on her boyfriend? It's one thing if Stephenie Meyer had been able to sell it, but as it is, it just seems hugely anti-feminist and annoying. A character who is nothing without another character is DULL. Especially since the reader is unable to escape from Bella's point-of-view, it becomes really unbearable.I think the book started to go bad for me when she manipulated Edward into staying with her during the battle. Firstly, because she just gets really emo afterward, going on and on about what an awful person she is. Secondly, because Edward really starts to lose his edge. A lot of what was interesting about them was how difficult it was for Edward to be around her, and how his love for her made him overcome that. All of those things are gone. Her blood doesn't bother him in the slightest. And now all she has to say is please a few times to get whatever she wants from him. Through it all, through everything awful Bella does to him, he is steadfast, forgiving, unselfish. I could have overlooked this, enjoyed it even, had Meyer not royally screwed Edward over in the end.By the way, the idea of Edward as a virgin made me laugh. His concern about getting into heaven made me laugh. And his insistence on marriage before sex made me roll my eyes. The author does a clumsy job of trying to hide her own ideals in the story, forcing them onto characters who have given no hint of such principles beforehand. In a whole century, Edward has never once tried to bury his pain in the arms of a woman? COME ON. It would have added a much-needed flaw to Edward's character. Besides, Edward being what he is, I would have expected a little more spiritual confusion.For me, these books have always been about Edward. Stephenie Meyer made it that way, most of the plot hinging on the state of their relationship. But rather than further explore the vampire/human difficulties of their relationship, throw some conflict between them and have them come out stronger than before, she tosses in your run-of-the-mill love triangle. Again, I would have been fine with this, could have forgiven the flatness of Bella's character, had things not gone so awfully wrong in the end.When Bella kissed Jacob back, I was livid at the author. The whole scene disgusted me, and I skimmed it to avoid the gory details. Does Bella not realize, or not care, that Edward will be able to see every one of her actions through Jacob's eyes? Does she even realize how excruciating that will be to him?But I kept reading, hoping Meyer would redeem herself somehow, would relight Bella and Edward's fire.After the scene in the truck, where she longs for Jacob's arms rather than Edwards, I threw the book down and didn't finish it for days after, I was so infuriated. The WHOLE POINT of the story, of Bella's character, was her steadfast, undying love for Edward. And suddenly the value of their relationship is reduced to the fact that she loves Edward just a little more than she does Jacob. It's SO unfair to Edward, who is really the innocent party in all of it. And then Meyer tries to take them back to what they were, returning them to the meadow at the end, and it doesn't work for me any more. The chemistry was gone for me. I didn't care whether Bella became a vampire, whether she would marry Edward...I had no expectation that the conclusion of these issues would be fulfilling at all.On top of all this, the big battle at the end was thoroughly disappointing. Not one character is lost, despite the danger...Seth isn't even injured fighting with the newborn vampire, despite his youth and inexperience. After all the Victoria build-up over two books, to see her ripped to pieces with extraordinary ease by Edward was hugely unsatisfying. No one had to sacrifice anything; in fact, the scene was so uncompelling I skimmed most of it. After 600-odd pages, this was inexcusable.This book thoroughly pissed me off. I will not be reading Breaking Dawn, or any of Stephenie Meyer's other books. I can't trust her anymore, which is too bad, but I don't think I have ever been so screwed over by an author as I was in this book. Yuck.</review>

<review id="7380">As a long time Dragon Nat. Speak user and recent iListen user, don't buy this product yet, at least don't pay full price for it. I had the bad DATA disk problem and just got my new one and now am up and running with MacSpeech.I like it but with the lack of being able to add new vocabulary and spell correction, this product is not of much use in real world dictation. There is no way to train new words to your voice. You can add new words via adding document. Wait until they have a "real" full blown version, then buy it. You will love it.Its pretty much exactly like Dragon Nat. Speaking, just for the MAC. It is much better than iListen by far.I work in a science dept, so not having the ability to train new words or correct them, puts me at a distinct disadvantage.  I am still using Dragon Nat. Speak (for WIN).There are some nice features, adding new global commands, text macros, that I will use often.But they rushed to get this product out before it was ready (did they used to work for Microsoft?!) and in so doing have made a lot of unhappy customers including myself. It WILL BE a nice product when they have it all together.If you do buy it, keep these limitations in mind.</review>

<review id="7381">Talk about going off on a tangentthis book was such a disapointment in comparision to the firsti felt the story was flighty and the characters lost much of the charm they had in the first book. while not as bad as the third book, i can think of a million things to better ocupy the time this book takes to read!this actually made me dislike the first book which is not a good step!my recomendations if your determined to read this series is read book one and four! SKIP BOOK TWO and THREE at ALL COSTS!</review>

<review id="7382">The new waterpik ultra is not as good as the older model! First problem is that it is hard to trun off. When you push on the off switch - with wet hands - the waterpik is so lite that it moves accross the sink and in order to turn it off you have to put down the hose and hold the waterpik with two hands! Then the other problem is that the plastic tank that holds the water can't be used to cover the waterpik. You can put it on top of the waterpik but it falls off and always onto the floor. The way that this new waterpik is made is such that any dirt or bugs (fly or nat) in the room can land into the deep well and it is not easy to clean it all out and it is not very healthy to leave the waterpik well uncovered. When you flush a toilet, any airborne germs can and will land into this waterpik. It was a very big disaportment to me. The company that sold it was fine, it's just a very poor modle. Plus it has  much less power than the older model.Jonathan Galente, long time waterpik user!</review>

<review id="7383">Just saw the last episode and was terribly disapointed in how predicatble and cheap everything became just as to make clean slate for Season 3 I guess.The story had juice but the comercial drive not to tarnish this mass murderer for more audience and wider acceptance ruined everything.If anything just a remake of season 1 with the killing of his own brother. Season 2 could have had a great finale if the last 2 minutes had been cut out and everyone had just moved ahead, but no, we had to endure a horrible cheapening by having a rightous Dexter fly around the globe as some silly rightuos vigilante.</review>

<review id="7384">After reading all the other reviews I couldn't wait to get my hands on this... but it wasn't 'all that' for me and my long haired cats. The Furminator took off less fur than the wire brush I had already been using!  Maybe it has to do with they type of hair/fur, who knows?  Obviously it works great for some people, but it wasn't worth $20 to me.  I'll be passing it on to a friend in hopes they have better luck with it.</review>

<review id="7385">Beware - this player is not for use with audiobooks!  Also, SanDisk has discontinued this model and no longer supports it!! Unfortunately, when I bought it there was no indication on the description or packaging that it did not work well with audiobooks.  The reason I bought the player was precisely for audiobooks!!!  I was extremely disappointed when I downloaded some books and tried listening to them.  They'll play on it; however, when you turn the player off you cannot get back to where you were!!  There's no bookmarking capability and when you try to FF through a large file, the player either locks up or returns to the beginning of the file.Apparently, the customer service for SanDisk is not too good either based on the info and reviews I found online.  I did try to submit a request for help due to my issue with this player but never received a response.  That is probably because the player is discontinued  I think the inability to play audiobooks is a 'bug' for this player and SanDisk either cannot or will not fix it.However, it does well with a typical 3-5 minute songs and has an FM tuner that works well.  For what it does do, it works relatively well.  It did not do what I wanted (play audiobooks with the ability to return to where you stopped), so I had to return it to Amazon.  Amazon was great about it, too.  Instead, I bought a used Creative Zune V Plus that does meet my needs for audiobooks.</review>

<review id="7386">I have not purchased this product, so the 1 star has no meaning, but I do use #4 Melitta Coffee filters in my current coffee maker.  What I do with the filters (and what the box instructs you to do)is to fold the bottom edge up and fold the side edge over on the filter before use.  If the other folks who purchased this product are not folding their filters, this may cause the problem of the filter being too high for this coffee maker.</review>

<review id="7387">This product is unreliable with notorious Netgear customer support. Warranty is useless.Purchased from Amazon back in Aug, 2008, had been happy until the day before Easter Day (March 22, 2008). The switch suddenly stopped working, all 8 lights blinking with wires unplugged.Called the support twice, both transferred outside USA. The second time during normal business hours, asked to transfer back to USA, was told no customer support in USA, asked to talk to supervisor, after 20 minutes, the supervisor picked up and put me on hold, then hung up the phone after 20 minutes...Also according to the warranty card, you have to pay shipping charges BOTH for the defective unit and the replacement unit. Plus the replacement unit is REFURBISHED. By taking into account of the shipping cost, you are paying half price for the refurbished and error prone product again.I have so many network switches with a lot cheaper prices, they have never failed. So why pay more for this unreliable device?We don't mind paying more for quality products. My recent experience did raise concerns on Netgear's ability to maintain the quality for the product.</review>

<review id="7388">I ordered Intuit Turbotax Delux 2008 from Amazon.com on January 2, 2009. I received my tax statements by mail on January 24, 2009.  This morning (January 25, 2009), I opened the Turbotax CD case and attempted to remove the CD, but found it stuck so tightly to the plastic center retainer that it cracked without budging.  I see this as defective packaging. But Amazon.com has a policy against return of OPENED software. I rate both of them a ONE-STAR ripoff.</review>

<review id="7389">I do not like the new program. It is much harder to use than 2003. It may have a few things that are now available in 2003 but the additions are not worth the frustration of having to search through all the different menues to find something that is available on the tool bar of 2003. Why can't microsoft  just add the new stuff without messing everything else up. That seems to be the way of all their upgrades!If I hadn't paid so much for the program I wouldn't think twice about going back to 2003. I may anyway!</review>

<review id="7390">I've had a lot of linksys routers and netgear routers which were basically plug and play, so to speak.  No hassele setups.  So when I heard about all the positives on this router I decided to upgrade.  Big mistake!  Out of the box, this router did not work at all with my desktop comupter; it was broadcasting a wireless connection for my laptop, but my desktop's connection was completely dead.  After numerous hours of trying to tweak it by both CD install, and both manual installs and checking the Dlink site by rehooking my old router back up, I gave up.  As other reviews note, initial setup can be tricky for this router.  I've had lots of routers in the past and none of them required the amount of tweaking I had to go through and even then, it still didn't work correctly.  Save yourself a big headache and get something else.</review>

<review id="7394">What a jumble of stuff this is in the 4th book!  Page after page of problems with easy solutions.... in fact, more so-called problems than anyone anywhere would ever experience, or even think about.  I loved the first book (I am a grandmother who loves good books).  Everyone can relate to young love..... The second book was about Jacob, and who cares? He was always mean and even hateful to Edward and what was there to like or admire about his relationship with his so-called best friend, Bella?  The third book.... I forgot what it was about..... But this final book is ridiculous.  I always hesitate to criticize episodic books, especially when they are written to soothe the readers of a first book, but this is too much.  Rosemary's baby meets Frankenstein's monster?  Too bad.  But I am still pleased with the casting of the movie and am looking forward to seeing it.</review>

<review id="7395">This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      Very disappointing. I found it boring and had a hard time sitting through the whole thing. The basic plot may have some content and a hint of morality with its warnings about trashing planet earth, but it comes through as a slow moving sequence of images with no meaningful dialogue. Having said that my 3-year old still likes it.The cardboard DVD case is also flimsy and would not last long in a household with children.</review>

<review id="7396">I gotta say I was interested due to all these high ratings. I purchased the download and started it right up. From the first looks I had a bad feeling. Let me say I am no tax expert and was hoping for more guidance on questions I didn't know about. One thing I don't like is when I come to an option that for the most part does not apply to business the highlighted option suggests to do it...you know what I mean? What I love with Turbo Tax is if it doesn't apply to the majority of business or Not Common it will suggest to Not do it. Plus TaxCut shows the tax form which makes it even more difficult for me personally. If I am missing something let me know. I would call may self an expert with software to say the least.I actually stopped halfway and went back to Turbo Tax.</review>

<review id="7398">I informed Intuit almost a month ago that I could not update TTax because it crashed my System every time I did "Check for Updates" (at startup).  They told me their Engineers were aware of and working on the problem, and would get back to me with a solution.  No response to date and I still can not update the program!A week ago, I used their "Repair" option, and that also failed -- so I uninstalled and re-installed it.  It did update during the Reinstall, but crashed again as soon as I tried to update it the next time I used it.  During the install I noticed that the Vista Aero Graphics were displaying on my XP system, and when TTax crashes, the Screen is only partially functional and the display is incomplete when it Crashes.I have used TTax since way back when ChipSoft owned it, but this year Intuit has outdone itself.  I expect to have to buy TaxCut to get out of this mess, and have to reenter all of my data.  That certainly means goodbye and good riddance to Intuit for me -- which has ruined another outstanding productTurboTax Deluxe Federal + State + eFile 2008.  I hope others are not experiencing my problems.  I will update this if anything good happens very soon.</review>

<review id="7399">Sadly this book was a let-down for me.  I wish I would have rented it from the library.  I was so excited to get this book after SM's first 3 books in the series.  I got into the series late 2007 after my sister-in-law had read them back in 2006 from her teenage cousins and stumbled across them in the library one day.  As a huge fan of the witch or vampire genre novels when I was teenager, SM did NOT disappoint with her first book.  BD was a bit of a let down as the writing style was completely different than her previous books.  I agree with the current most helpful reviews of B. Donereu, swong, and J. Harbert.  I can't say anything more than what has already been said.   I will reread this book eventually but it doesn't invoke the same excitement as re-reading the first 3.  I hope Stephanie does release Midnight Sun and was saddened to hear what happened to her.  I hope in a few years she might consider going back to the writing style of the first three and work on growing her characters a bit more.  For a young writer though, I think this was a fantastic effort.  Her writing style is becoming predictable though (as evident by "The Host" - which I also ready on the day of release).</review>

<review id="7401">This review is from: Transporter 3 (Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      Bond Schmond.  Bourne, McClane, not even Ace Ventura can elevate foolishness to this level of absolute goofy absurdity.  If intelligence is Mercury, Transporter 3 is Pluto.  No gov't bailout could save this massive debt of dumbness. No hope for common sense, somebody owes me an hour and a half back.  Oh well, at least I didn't pay to see this turd.Now, I love a good action movie, even if it stretches the realm of realism.  A competent director can make you accept the impossible, like in Tarantino's KILL BILL or Besson's TAKEN.  But unfortunately there never is a single shred of believability here.  The nonsense completely undermines the decent fight choreography and quasi-impressive stunts.  Example--Frank escaping the bad guys by driving his car into the river and using air from the tire to breathe underwater?  Stupid!  There's plenty more where that came from. Anyway, I'm done ranting about this garbage.  If you liked DIE HARD 4, this movie might be for you.</review>

<review id="7403">I had been using Norton 360 Version 1 for 10 months. It appeared to function as advertised, although one has no way of knowing whether it really works or not. I was offered an update to Version 2 as part of the 1 year subscription entitlement. Version 2 not only disallows the backups I carefully made under Version 1 (which means I cannot restore from them) but I can no longer even use Windows to back up my files nor use System Restore. So the most critical and basic security function no longer works under Version 2. What happens is that when you attempt to do a backup (or restore), Norton requires you to configure it (no problem with that), but you cannot do this because you no longer can set a local drive as the backup destination! So you can no longer use local hard drives or DVD drives or anything but their online backup space which you need to pay additional for, is not large enough, and which is, by definition, insecure since you have no control over it. Of course when you try to contact the company, you are faced with daunting obstacles. You may, of course, pay them extra so that you can talk to someone. Otherwise tough for you. Their online chat is a joke with wait times of an hour or more. They then disconnect you from the session and you have to restart from the bottom of the queue again. I never did get through to anyone which I gather is by design. At this point, I will go back to Version 1 which I hope I will be able to do successfully and then use a completely different product when my subscription expires. So be forewarned!</review>

<review id="7404">I have been attempting for some time to use this drive as a backup for my Mac.  Ideally, one would like to drop large folders on it, containing, say, your photography archive.  Unfortunately, the drive eventually times out and gives various errors.  When this happens, I cannot umount the drive or to get DiskUtility to verify it.  The drive basically can't be written to until I reboot.  I have reformatted the drive for Mac HFS, twice now, yet the problem remains.Seagate support did not respond to my email.I am extremely disappointed with this drive.</review>

<review id="7405">As someone who researches a product extensively before purchase, I thought I had found a winner in the Keurig B60 Special Edition brewing system. And honestly, there IS a lot to like about it. No grinding or measuring of coffee is a HUGE plus. There are lots of different brands of K-Cups out there to choose from, so the coffee choice is not limited, which was one of my fears when I purchased this brewer. On top of that, being able to brew one cup at a time at a preferred size setting is incredibly convenient.However, there are enough negatives about this coffee maker that I just can't recommend it. First, the coffee is weak, even on the smallest size setting. It's not bitter, which is good, but most of the K-Cups produce a less-than-flavorful blend. Regular coffee, flavored coffee, decaf coffee -- I tried it all with the same results. In desperation (because I am actually a light-to-medium roast fan), I tried the Extra Bold K-Cups that are out there with MUCH better results, but there aren't too many varieties of Extra Bold to choose from at this time. So I ended up with a limited coffee choice after all.The other issue I had with this brewer is that about six months after I purchased it, the display would say "ready to brew," but when I pushed the button, nothing happened for a few minutes. Then it did brew -- the entire contents of the reservoir! I had a huge mess all over my kitchen. I called Keurig to get support and was told that 1) I probably needed to descale (run vinegar through it for a full cleaning); and 2) to unplug it for a few hours to let it "reset."I did both of these things, and lo and behold, the coffee maker worked like new again -- for about three weeks. Then it was back to its old tricks. At Keurig's suggestion, I kept descaling and unplugging until one day, about a year and a half after purchase, it started brewing and spitting water and steam out the top, and nothing I could do would get it to stop. Of course, this was after the warranty period had expired!I will admit that it's entirely possible I got a lemon. I know and fully accept that this happens sometimes with electronic devices. With all the other folks on here raving about this exact coffee maker, I wonder if I just got a bad one. Or maybe I didn't descale enough in the first six months that I had it and that caused some kind of problem. Still, I have heard and read similar comments about the weakness of the brew these coffee makers produce. And it would have been nice if Keurig customer service had seen fit to replace my coffee maker within the warranty period rather than simply telling me to descale and unplug.The Keurig brewers are expensive, and so I expected something very solid and exceptional. Unfortunately, I think my old Hamilton Beach Brewstation did a better job at half the price. I see why people like these Keurig brewers, and maybe someday I'll try one again to see if they've been improved. But for now, I think I'll replace this brewer with something completely different.</review>

<review id="7406">I have used TT for 8 years now and I am finally going to switch.  I have been considering purchasing the product again this year, despite the inflated price and the printing fees (which were rescinded) but now that I hear the Deluxe version will not support Schedules C or D, that is the final straw.  What kind of Company switches it's product to include less for more money?  That is just ludicrous!!!!  I will use Tax Cut this year and import my data from TT files.

<review id="7408">This is a nice coffeemaker in that it has lots of great features.   Unfortunately, it is unreliable.  My first one failed after 18 months.  Cuisinart was very accommodating and mailed me a second one.  The downside was that I had to pay for shipping on the new one ($10) and the broken unit (also about $10) that was to be returned.  I weighed my options and decided that $20 for shipping both was worth it to get a new one.  The second one lasted 3 months.  Same problem as the first one.  When plugged in it would work for an hour or maybe just a few minutes.  After a while it wouldn't work at all.  As a scientist, when I see two failures of the same nature in one product I become suspicious.  My guess is that they use cheap electronic components in this coffeemaker.  Buyer beware!p.s. Also beware of customer service.  On my first call for the second unit the agent offered to waive shipping costs for the new unit.  Nice gesture.  I didn't have my serial number handy so I had to call back. They won't setup a case file for incomplete calls so you have to start over.  Very irritating!  The second agent refused to waive shipping even though I mentioned the first agent's offer several times.  Bottom line, just keep calling back and maybe you'll get a sympathetic customer service agent.</review>

<review id="7415">After seeing the amazing Kung Fu Panda 2 weeks before,I had high hopes that 6 yr. old granddaughter,her Dad and I were in for another treat going to see this,boy were we in for a MAJOR letdown!WALL-E doesn't even come close to KFP's production quality on ANY level!There is almost no story to speak of,nor dialog,for that matter which consists entirely of Wall-e saying Eve's name and Eve saying WALL-E's name! There are maybe 4 cute actions in the entire movie.We went to the 7:30PM show and the theater though packed,was mostly very quiet. None of the laughter throughout,like at the showing of Kung Fu Panda,where it seemed everyone was being thoroughly entertained.In fact,I suspect that many like my granddaughter,and her daddy,had fallen asleep,and I couldn't keep from yawning the last 40 minutes. This film is not entertaining or even remotely interesting,and it is incredibly UGLY to look at!Warning Spoilers Ahead: Earth is nothing but an enormous uninhabited garbage dump,and the space station that WALL-E follows Eve to by stowing away on her rocket ship is full of morbidly obese humans who are so fat(nothing to do because everything is automated) that they can no longer walk so they fly around in motorized chairs.The Pixar Short shown before the film far surpasses WALL-E!This is one that should have gone direct to video,because I sure wish we had saved our money and waited to rent it on DVD. It isn't worth an outing to the theater,IMO.`Kung Fu Panda' Clobbers `Wall-E' at Annie AwardsKung Fu Panda shut out its competition in every major feature film category at the 36th annual Annie Awards celebrating 2008's best animated movies. The DreamWorks Animation pic bested critic favorite Wall-E and other nominee Bolt for "Best Feature."The surprise win is the first time DreamWorks has beaten a Pixar film for the top prize since 2001's Shrek over Pixar's Monster's Inc. Panda took home fifteen statues Friday night and tied for the most wins ever. The Annie Award has matched the "Best Animated Feature" category at the Academy Awards every single year but one.http://newsinfilm.com/?p=8544</review>

<review id="7418">Have you noticed the price of the older 2008 version has gone from $130 to over $300 on Amazon?  That's because the word is out that 2008 works and 2009 doesn't.Most of the problems I've had were with online banking downloads HOWEVER if you are running a business and don't use online banking I highly recommend you try it.  In 2008 online banking really works and saves time.  Unfortunately it doesn't work for me in 2009.The only nice addition of 2009 is it handles foreign currency, however, 2008 works so much better I can live without that feature.  Wait for QuickBooks Pro 2010 and hopefully they will get these problems sorted.</review>

<review id="7419">The 4th generation IPod Nano is a wonderful product in itself if you plan to use it as a stand alone device.  The unit is beautifully sleek and the screen display is very sharp.  When I first took it out of the box I was amazed how slim it is.  Everything about this Nano looked and felt elegant and streamlined.I was extremely happy with my IPod purchase until I started shopping for accessories.  Apparently, the 4th generation IPod Nano is not fully compatible with a lot of IPod accessories out on the market.  Originally I had envisioned building up my home and car audio systems around this IPod.  As I shopped around I quickly learned that many products are not compatible with the 4th generation IPod.  This is making shopping for accessories a very unpleasant experience.  I have to resort to researching the product documentations to see which IPod is supported.Not being able to charge the 4th generation IPod seems to be a very common problem.  Not sure what Apple had in mind when they changed the 4th generation IPod interface, but for me the incompatibility issue is a huge disappointment.  I've scuttled my plans to build a home audio system around this IPod and to upgrade my car stereo simply because they are not compatible.I'm giving this IPod 2 stars because of the huge potential that is lost by not being backward compatible.  I hope Apple will better standardize their IPod interfaces.  Having to constantly read through product fine prints, when shopping for accessories, to see which IPod is supported and which is not -- only to find that the 4th generation seems to be the least compatible verion is a very disappointing experience to say the least.</review>

<review id="7420">The program worked fine for my needs--fast, straight forward tax preparation.  However, my major complaint is the advertising on this package.  It says Federal + State right on the cover, but what is mean is Federal + 1 State.  Since I lived in two different states during 2007, I obviously am responsible for filing taxes in both states.   This is not the program to do that with.  They wanted an extra $40 for the second state.  No where on the package that I can find does it say that the program is good for only one state.  I feel cheated.  I doubt I will by another TurboTax in the future, just out of principle.</review>

<review id="7421">Our daughter graduated from the Swaddlers to the Cruisers.  We bought 2 boxes, because we figured she'll need a lot of diapers.  We liked the fit and they didn't leak BUT they left little cotton pieces all over. She started to get mild irritation on her bottom.  We contacted Pampers and they sent a coupon for replacement diapers.  There was no correspondence from them, just a coupon.  We assumed that pack was just defective.  We bought another box.  It still left cotton.  We returned it and bought another.  Finally a package that didn't leave cotton pieces!  Yet her irritation changed to a rash covering her whole bottom, her lower abdomen and lower back (everywhere the diaper touched...but not in the creases...).  We stopped using her wipes, thinking we were wiping off the bits of cotton too hard.  Then in a few days her rash had developed further.    We thought maybe it was allergies, so I stopped introducing new foods.  It persisted, then we thought it was diaper rash due to moisture; therefore we changed her every hour.  We lathered her in diaper rash medications, trying 4 different ones--none of which worked.  We gave her Aveeno baths and the rash would become milder, but would come back just as bad in a few hours.  Then a doctor told us it was it was fungal..yea gross!  Therefore we treated it by applying a topical cream twice a day for weeks.  This helped reduce the irritation by half, at least, but it still persisted.  3 months we thought of everything, we tried everything for a few days to see if it would go away but nothing seemed to cure it!!  Finally, I said that I didn't want to use the diapers at all for a week.  We switched to Huggies.  Like magic--I kid you not--in 2 days the rash was almost completely gone.  Today, 4 days later, there was no sign of any irritation at all!!Searching online, I have found other cases of parents having the same problem :(  We are contacting Pampers to see what might be causing this, because she doesn't have allergies nor does she have sensitive skin.For those of you that it doesn't cause a rash, you are lucky.  For others, if you are seeing a rash, I'd try another brand :(</review>

<review id="7422">I just want to warn everyone who uses this product that I personally believe that it caused seizures in my 7 year old Boston Terrier.  One day after Frontline Plus was applied she suffered a seizure.  After the seizure happened, I tried to think what she may have come in contact with that could have caused the seizure.  After doing a Google search of "Frontline Plus" +seizure" I found numerous pet owners who believed this pesticide caused seizures in their pets.  Please do the same Google search before you continue to give this product to your pet!  My dog had one more seizure 22 days later and since that time has been seizure free.</review>

<review id="7425">I have no issue with the pedometer's functioning but the battery compartment is closed with a very small screw which is very easy to drop and not easy to replace.  The cover  has to fit a small tongue into a slot so the screw must come all the way out and you need a tiny screwdriver for it.  The battery costs about $6 but you can't use it if you can't put the cover back on because the tiny screw has disappeared.  Easy to use,  screw-on cover designs for batteries this size exist that can be opened with a coin, why make it so very difficult? I am looking for something that doesn't waste my time and money so I can go walking.</review>

<review id="7426">I have been using trimmers for years. This trimmer is low maintenance because it is totally mechanical. It is as good as you twist your hands to make it mechanically function. It does a decent job on hair in a middle location. It is no value for trimming close to skin or for doing real detail work that an electronic model can do. You can trim behind ears or hair real close to skin. I find now that I am back in the market for an electronic model because this is so limited in what it can do. Just be aware that if you don't twist your hands just right you'll have poor results anywhere. I am greatly disappointed with this purchase.</review>

<review id="7427">Purchased this toaster oven about 20 months ago - it worked splendidly for that time and then it inexplicably died it won't toast on the top and the oven function (thermostat) is now useless.  It may be that with four in the household we killed it through over use, but I doubt it - our previous toaster oven (a crappy Black and Decker)lasted 4 or 5 years.  I'm hard pressed to understand why a $90 product works out to about 60 bucks a year and then you have to toss it.  I may go back to buying $30 crappy toaster ovens and replace annually.</review>

<review id="7429">There is something wrong with the DHCP server on this router. Even after upgrading to the latest firmware, the DHCP server constantly drops the IPs from my computers. I can be in the middle of surfing, playing games over the net or even mid-download, the DHCP server will attempt to renew and drop the internet connection. The LAN will still be operational, but the internet will suddenly be inacccessible. The support page only offers "reset everything..." which is ludicrous. A person should not have to constantly return to the router to reset it manually. I end up resetting the router 3-4 times a day. I had a Linksys 802.11b router and gave it away to my brother when I upgraded to G. I seriously regret that now. This Netgear is the most finicky/exasperating router I have ever encountered. I will never buy from Netgear again, and will now spend more money for a new Linksys g rouiter.</review>

<review id="7430">We purchased this coffee maker and received it promptly. After brewing the initial hot water to clean the machine, we made one pot of coffee in this unit. It tasted fine -- nothing spectacular here. We unplugged the unit to move it to its permanent home on the counter and when attempting to make coffee the next morning we were surprised to find that the unit wouldn't turn on. We tried everything would could think of, but it was as if the machine had completely died after brewing twice. The clock wouldn't even come on. It was then that I actually noticed all the negative feedback this unit has received. We returned it and are now trying to pick out a non-Cuisinart brand of coffee maker to buy. Pretty disappointing.</review>

<review id="7431">Besides the cockeyed video expressed by other reviewers, what makes this series really annoying is that they made it politically correct. Are we to believe that John Adams wife was his mentor and that she guided him on what to do? How about George Washington and Thomas Jefferson's wives, were they instrumental in their decisions too? I seriously doubt it. In 1776 the view of women was not as mentors and equals but as wives and mothers who watched after the home and children and that was it. They had no say in politics or for that matter much else. Another farce expressed in the movie is that at the Boston Massacre was started because a British soldier, Hugh White, was being picked on for no reason and that the order to shoot was not given by a British soldier. According to historians this is how it actually happened.   On March 5, 1770, Hugh White served as sentry on King Street.  Some time after eight o'clock, White entered into an exchange with a wig-maker's apprentice, Edward Garrick, who was demanding payment from a British officer.  The exchange escalated into violence, as White struck Garrick with his musket, knocking him to the ground.  Regardless of which version of the story is more accurate, it is undisputed that within minutes an unruly crowd of young men surrounded Montgomery and began hurling insults such as "Bloody lobster back!" at him.  When the crowd swelled and he began being pelted with pieces of ice, Montgomery hurried to the Custom House, banged on the door and shouted, "Turn out, Main Guard!"  The eight-man guard finally emerged and marched to his rescue through a swelling crowd.  Private Hugh Montgomery was one of the eight soldiers in the main guard commanded by Captain Preston to march to the Custom House in an attempt to save Hugh White.  After making their way to White, Montgomery and the other soldiers found themselves being surrounded by the mob.  They formed a sort of semi-circle.  Soon, after a confusion of snowballs, ice chunks, and coal rained down on the British soldiers, someone shouted "fire" and five Americans were fatally wounded.  Trial testimony never definitively answered the question of who shouted "fire" and who fired the fatal shots.  In 1949, however, with the long-delayed publication of notes of Thomas Hutchinson, it was revealed that Montgomery admitted to his lawyers that it was he who started the Boston Massacre.  Hit in the chest and knocked to the ground by a club wielded by one of the rioters, Montgomery responded, he said, by shouting "Damn you, fire!"  Montgomery fired first then the other soldiers followed. Of the British soldiers tried in October 1770, the jury convicted only Montgomery and one other soldier, Matthew Killroy.  Both were found guilty of manslaughter.   Montgomery and Killroy pleaded "the privilege of clergy," a procedure that reduced their punishment from imprisonment to a branding on the right thumb.Don't believe me?

<review id="7432">Normally I might wait to install a new software upgrade, but I just got a new laptop and thought it would be best to use Office 2007 with the new Vista operating system. I was wrong.You would expect that a multi-billion dollar company like Microsoft could put out a powerful and bug-free piece of software. But after a month of using Office 2007, you get the distinct impression that this software is not ready for public release. Microsoft should be ashamed.I don't know the root cause of my problems, but I have to stress that I am running a clean install of Office 2007 on Vista, so there shouldn't be any software conflicts or issues. So what are my issues? The list is long:-- My biggest concern is that MS Word constantly hangs and stalls. It can making editing a document very painful. I suspect the problem is when I put images or Visio diagrams into a document. But that is something the old MS Word was able to do without an issue. Oddly, if I have a colleague open the document and save it out in Word 2003, the problem goes away! What?! It's killing my productivity.-- When ever I cut and paste from an old document, Word hangs for 15 to 20 seconds. And often the formatting and margins in my new document go haywire. I keep having to spend a ton of time fixing things. This never happened in the old Word. This is another time killer.-- Every few days, Outlook 2007 starts telling me that it cannot display my email folders. Uh oh! I have to completely restart my computer to see my email again.-- Outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails that people send -- they look like a mess. It is because Outlook 2007 does NOT render HTML correctly since it uses the Word engine, not Internet Explorer to display email. I have no idea why Microsoft did this, but they have got to fix it.-- Many of the issues in the old Word 2003 still haven't been fixed. If you place an image, it can often be hard to get it to appear correctly. Why can't they solve this one?-- While most Office programs have the new ribbon interface (which I like), some programs like Visio 2007 do not. So you have to remember how to use two interfaces. Couldn't Microsoft find the time and money to update ALL its programs? Give me a break.-- On a few occassions in Visio 2007, my files have failed to save correctly. At first I thought this must have been my fault, but it's happened to me a few times and can't be a coincidence. A few times I've gotten an error message and lost my work. Ug.-- Word and Excel 2007 use a completely new file format. So anyone you send a document to has to have 2007 installed (which isn't likely the case). To get around this, you can save it down to a 2003 file format, but then you end up with two files on your hard drive -- one in the new format and one in the old format. What a pain! Also, there definitely seems to be an issue with Office 2007 opening older Office 2003 files. Could be the cause of many of my problems, but there is no way I can avoid using old files. They should have worked harder on compatibility.There are good things about the new 2007. I do like the new interface design and the new features in Outlook 2007 are amazing for organizing tasks and sharing your calendar.But I don't think it's fair that Microsoft released a product so full of serious, serious bugs that have cost me hours and hours of extra work. I didn't spend hundreds of dollars on a beta product and don't think the public should have to suffer. Surely they can afford to do better!NEW ADDITION TO MY REVIEW:Today I discovered that I can no longer paste Excel charts into Word like I used to. When I try, the chart goes in, but any bars/lines disappear.</review>

<review id="7434">Well I don't think anyone should be "flipping" over this video camera.  Yes, the Flip Ultra powers on quickly, has an easy software installation and use and is convenient in size/functionality...but that's it.  This camera will soon disappoint even most moderate camera or computer savvy person.  First off, the 640x480 resolution I think is the worst thing about this camera.  This pixel ratio translates roughly into a 4x3 inch size on your computer monitor for good resolution, go smaller size on your screen and the picture is really good but how small of a image do you really want to view your video at?  Go bigger than this size and the picture instantly degrades to a very poor image, i.e.: you will never view a quality video from the Flip even at a size of a standard monitor (e.g. 17 inches or bigger).As for the TV Out viewing (via Composite video), it too is ok, reasonable at best but the image will black letter box (left & right) to fit a television.  I tested this capability on my sister in law's brand new 46 inch Toshiba plasma - it looked ok, but no where near the resolution of the 4x3 inch picture this camera is intended for.  I also tested it on my home theater set up.  This did not work at all because as for most folks who have an aged but properly set up system - you can only use one single video cable type if run through your receiver.  In my case, I have s-video so in order to view the Flip video on my system I would need to disconnect everything - not worth my time on that.  I did manage to get the cable to work on my projector, again the resolution was the same as plasma TV - nothing to rave about.I wanted to rate this lower but the camera does what it is supposed to at it's price point. I just wish I knew more, or if the company Pure Digital who makes the Flip was a bit more upfront about its limited resolution capability...I would of not made this purchase.If you are a stickler for quality in general (albeit enjoy higher resolution) and/or do not want to have to watch all your videos on a computer screen at a really small size - I suggest you chub up and buy a better camcorder from a reputable company.Oh, BTW their customer service is mediocre, prefers to handle everything via email even though there is 1-888 number, and is not quick in response.The best use I see for the Flip is to (as Amazon has already caught on) use it for video reviews from now on.  So with that, my next review will be visual.  Hmmm...if that's the case maybe Amazon can sell a cheaper camcorder even marketed just for this purpose - I'd bet they sell.</review>

<review id="7435">Well, I hate giving a bad review, but I was really excited about these sheets, and really disappointed in what I got. It's hard to complain when you're getting them for half normal retail, but they are the quality of factory seconds at best. The pillow cases are the most poorly made I've ever seen; the fabric is completely bunched up and both unattractive and uncomfortable. Also, the cloth became rough and "fuzzy" after one wash. I suppose even Egyptian cotton thread can be poorly spun.On the bright side, the blue color is just lovely, and as I said, they were relatively cheap. If you're in the market they are worth a try, maybe you'll do better than I did.</review>

<review id="7438">As a work of fiction and a theological narrative The Shack scores average or below average on both fronts.  For a book so highly touted by well-respected critics, this book was a huge disappointment.The Fiction.If I was grading just the book for the sake of it's fiction and Young's writing prowess I'd have to give it a C+.To Young's credit the plot is provocative and excellent.  It's the perfect set-up to inject the kind of encounter the central character ends up having with three characters who represent God.  A runaway teenager grows up, goes to seminary and gets married all while battling the demons of an abusive father and family he leaves behind at the age of 13. Our central character, Mack Phillips moves to Oregon, finds some success and marries a down-to-earth Christian woman with sense and sensitivity. While in his early 50s, Mack undergoes the tragic abduction of his six-year-old girl at the hands of infamous serial killer.  Four years later, Mack gets a mysterious note in his mail box during a fierce ice storm that sets in motion his return to the cabin, hundreds of miles away from his home, where his young daughter was murdered and his faith was left behind.  Mack returns to ultimately discover God and has a long face-to-face with his Maker while being sent a few "neatly wrapped gifts" to help bring closure to his grief ravaged life. Young's great set up unfortunately unravels in the details. The first two chapters read like a special presentation on The Hallmark Channel and the last two read like a Left Behind novel.  Dripping with sentimental goo and unnecessary adjectives, Young waxes eloquent (tries anyway) about ice storms in the Pacific Northwest and the majestic beauty of the Eagle Cap Wilderness area in Northeastern Oregon.  Now don't get me wrong, as a native of the area I can tell you first hand that our region is beautiful, but Young over-labors and belabors his imagery and works extra hard to pull you in.  It's not until the chapter "The Great Sadness" where Young finally settles down and tells a good story and in doing so, he finally does pull you in - at least until he takes you back some years later.  The rest of the book plods along, sometimes akwardly, sometimes strangely, with Mack's encounter with the Trinity.  The Trinity is represented by terribly conventional characters (never mind all that stuffy Old Testament imagery depicting God in a cloud, the wind or fire that's actually in the Bible) and to Mack's amazement the love and relationship each of these persons have for one another wins him over - though you might be left shaking your head.  The end of the story is clumsy and predictable but with a few near redeeming moments - and overall the emotionalism works in keeping the story memorable though not all happily so.The Theology.If I had to grade this book purely on Young's theology, that he painfully tries to convince you is orthodox and revolutionary, I'd be forced to give it a D+.  Many reviews here deal with Young's defunct views on the Trinity as it relates to Scripture, and so I won't beat the proverbial dead horse, but I do have more subtle, yet deeper theological bones to pick with Mr. Young that haven't been touched on from those reviews I've seen.First, ironically, Young tries hard to paint the picture that God is nothing like we can imagine, but then fails to accomplish this task by making God as ordinarily human as possible.  Jesus spills some sauce.  Each of the members engage in ordinary household chores.  Dinner conversation between the members of the Trinity is as normal as any family.  The banter throughout the book between the "trinitarian three" is surprisingly glib and irreverent - and yes, all very human. Each person tell and shows us how much Young wants us to see how God lovingly condescended for Mack, but Young takes it too far and kills any hope for awe. And what exactly is so awe-inspiring outwardly about an African American and Asian woman along with a Middle Eastern man speaking glibly with each other and Mack in such common ways?  God is depicted in Scripture as being beautiful and amazing outwardly, not just inwardly, no?  Young does some quick covering for this in the book, but it leaves with you with the kind of grimace and head shaking that says you just aren't buying it. What is most probably the most tragic part of this book - keeping in mind that it is a book of fiction engineered to promote the author's theological convictions - is how God (in all persons) is not just tolerant of Mack's self-absorption, but rather encourages it.  Young quickly dances back-and-forth between Scripture and personal philosophies that requires us to go to Jesus to find God and finding this path to God through self-discovery apart from Jesus.  What the reader is left with is the kind of eastern mystic mumbo jumbo that has you wondering if the character Papa wasn't just a wholesale lift from the Oracle's persona found in the movie The Matrix.  Seriously, I half expected at some the point for Papa to say:  "Now Mack, take a cookie and go fishing on the lake.  I promise you that once you go through that doorway, you'll feel as right as rain."The end result of Young's portrayal of God is a low view of the sinfulness of humanity, despite it being the very root cause of Mack's inability to submit himself to God and his distrust of Jesus. For instance, Mack gets to judge God, and finds him guilty, but Mack isn't really asked to consider his sin nature as the true reason he is unable to see and trust God.  Instead, Mack is asked to shun authority, individuality and modern thinking as the true evils of life and he is then urged to join a relationship with God in spite of them. On other occasions, Mack is then taught that all humans are God's children and that none will likely see hell in the end - at least he's given no reason for any to expect hell. This seemingly subtle, yet massive shift in Young' portrayal of the Gospel, unveils a gospel presentation that removes the Gospel itself.  That is to say, it removes Mack's essential need for a Savior to begin with. And afterall, this is what Mack came to the cabin looking for: Reconciliation and release from his guilt and all his doubts about God, yes? Young fails to see and deal with the problem at the end of the book.In another instance Young's Jesus says, "Papa, I loved watching you today as you made yourself fully available to take Mack's pain into yourself and then give him space to choose his own timing.  You honored him and you honored me."  But beyond the immediate Scriptural problems this presents, it also reveals Mack's whole problem.  He has been choosing his timing and wanting his own space his whole life and he's just as spiritually miserable and lost now after the death of his little girl as he was before - so Papa ends up teaching him nothing that he hasn't already learned - he's just telling Mack that everything's a-okay, just be a sinner and be my child and we'll worry about all that wrath, sin and hell stuff later.Now it's obvious that Young is using The Shack to vent his own theological frustrations well before you get to the end which has him saying as much.  I for one, applaud Young for using this kind of medium to express it in an entertaining heart-felt way.  But what's disappointing and disturbing is that Young tosses his ideas about hell (his universalism?) and God's sovereign will (his open theism?) around while contradicting himself. There is no anticipation of the objections he had to know would be coming and there is no effort to resolve them any deeper than at a surface level.Here's a few examples.One example of this involves a scene where Mack is condemning his little girl's killer to hell and then is asked to decide which two of his five children should go to hell a few moments later.  Young makes a good emotional appeal here to get an unrepentant serial killer out of hell, but he never resolves the contradiction between his views through Mack's dilemma and Jesus' constant warnings of hell that are found repeatedly in the Gospel.  On another occasion, we have Mack and Papa talking about his little girl's death that leads Papa to say that he doesn't orchestrate evil to accomplish his purposes.  Again, this is another wonderful emotional appeal, but it doesn't align with Scripture. The greatest evils ever committed on earth were orchestrated (foretold by prophets hundreds of years earlier no less) by God so that the death and resurrection of his Son could take place as meticulously planned.  So if God had planned the greatest of all evils in order to rescue those who would believe in him, wouldn't he use "lesser evils" to accomplish his purposes in bringing his children to him as well? Young, sadly, doesn't say.But here's the creme de la creme.  Young writes as part of his conclusion:  "Our dream is to sell enough copies of this book to open the door for a feature film that the world would want to see and that will present an accurate understanding of God's character and nature to a world that longs in the deepest places of their hearts for such a God."  Uh, shouldn't the medium that accurately reveals the God of the Universe be the Bible itself? And why does Mr. Young seem to be suggesting that The Shack is a better vehicle than Scripture to accomplish this? This is an old trap with success, and no matter how well you tug the heart strings, a half-truth is still a lie and a contradiction is still a contradiction. The proof of Young's claim here will take at least 50 years to judge, but if history is any indication, what you'll see is yet another flash-in-the-pan fad excite the masses only to wane and die as it bears no lasting long-term fruit for the Kingdom of God.All that said, there are a few redeeming qualities about the book, but only a few.  For instance, individuality needs to be left behind in the Christian life. God seeks relationship with us, though in a far different manner than Young suggests.  And Young's constant prompts for us to love one another is good stuff.  In the end, the Shack may indeed turn out to be this generation's Pilgrim's Progress (as Eugene Peterson suggests it will be) but if it is, it is I fear it's likely to be the allegory of the spiritual shallowness that dominates and firmly grips the American Church today.</review>

<review id="7439">The N Band on either 2.4 or 5Ghz did not work with my Linksys DMA2200. The a/b/g wireless worked great on my laptop. However, I bought this router to do N only so I had to send it back. I would wait until they fix the issues with Wireless-N.</review>

<review id="7440">Looks great, and worked fine for me as a casual, intermittent user (about once every two weekends). After 18 months of intermittent use, it inexplicably stopped heating the water. Now I just get cold water to the brew basket, and cold water getting squirted out of the steam nozzle. Now it's just a heavy block of useless metal. I'd imagine if I had used it on a daily basis, it would have broken much sooner -- perhaps within the 1-year warranty period, but from reading other reviews, it sounds like their warranty service is poor.</review>

<review id="7441">First try:I tried to install it on a non English notebook. Failed -- said that it's not competitable.Second try:I try it on my notebook with English version Windows Vista. Still not working. I tried to install it for a couple times but it keeps telling me to subscribe the service. I follow their instruction but it still no use. Keep sending me to the same web page even after I register for a brand new ID.Conclusion: This software is a joke. Microsoft is not doing a good job on supporting their own product. I have a couple of Microsoft's products, including the Live Cam for XBOX. I can't get it work with my Vista notebook. It's a shame.</review>

<review id="7442">I've been reading the Twilight series for awhile now and I loved Twilight, and New Moon to a lesser extent, but the lack of character development throughout the series has seriously annoyed me. I thought the creation stories about Rosalie, Jasper and the pack were interesting in Eclipse, but Bella just irritated me all the time. I thought I was supposed to identify with her, as the heroine of the series, but I don't at all. She's whiny, dependent and selfish. I find Jacob and Edward to be less annoying than Bella, but their complete obsession with her is throws me a bit.Breaking Dawn was entertaining and kept me reading, but some of the things SM did to her characters, I just can't understand. I mean Renesme Carlie, seriously. Who on earth thinks that its a nice name? And the anticlimactic battle scene at the end. I'm interested in the Volturi and the other vampires that exist, but we barely get to see them and learn about them. I would have loved to hear more about the Romanians, or Dracula 1 and Dracula 2 as Jacob put it.  And I thought Leah's story would have been way more interesting than Breaking Dawn. She developed more as a character in one book than Bella has in four. Also, I know some people have been complaining about Bella's power, but I guess she does worry an awful lot about everyone. I just wish SM had explained what happened to Bella's extreme aversion to blood (Twilight biology anyone?)Overall it was an entertaining read, but I won't be reading it again. It'll just be on my bookcase to complete the series.</review>

<review id="7443">I bought this as a replacement for my much-used Creative Muvo TX FM, which is nearing the end of its life.  The Sansa's display is more informative, and it makes good use of MP3 tags for organizing files, but two dealbreaker problems mean I'll be passing it on to someone else:First, I expected to use the arm strap to carry it around.  The "case" to hold the Sansa for this is a piece of the thinnest, flimsiest plastic.  It fastens together with two buttons, one of which broke the first time I unsnapped it.  They really could have splurged and spent $0.002 per unit to make this usable, instead of $0.001.More importantly, there's no way to delete a file directly on the player.  You have to delete a file on the computer, then sync it to the player to get rid of it.I can't imagine what they were thinking.  I use my player to listen to podcasts, some of which are daily 1-2 minute episodes.  I usually delete them right after listening to them.  Am I supposed to walk around with 20 already-heard files until I can get back to my computer, skipping around them and trying to find the ones I haven't heard yet?There's no way I can use it like this.  I wish I'd known before taking it out of the packaging, but who would have imagined such an obviously necessary feature could be missing?  Now all I can do is put it on Ebay.</review>

<review id="7444">I have a Cruzer 1 Gig drive and it has served its purpose well.  After two uses on this one, it went capoot.  I'm debating trying again.

<review id="7445">I bought one of these, used it 3 times and it stopped working. Won't connect to my computer anymore which is great because I have some songs on there I backed up, but can't get to now. Not too cool having a back up drive that fails.

<review id="7446">I have had lots of problems with the installation of this product.  I have spent over 7 hours on the phone with Microsoft India and it still isn't completely right.

<review id="7447">The performance of this oven was just OK and it's not a cheap oven. Then, after 15 months, a part of the top heating coil just stopped heating so you can only toast on the left side of the oven. I've had cheap ovens last much longer. As pointed out by other reviewers, it's just too expensive to repair one of these units out of warranty, so it's just pretty much junk.</review>

<review id="7449">I dont want to go on whole rant with spoilers, but I will say that I was disappointed. The character development and personalities of Bella, Edward, and Jacob that made me fall in love with them in the first three books gets washed away because of weird rediculous events that happen that you would never see coming...or you would expect too much to happen, after reading Eclipse. SM just made it too easy for everyone to get there cliche happy ending. Its worth the read to see what happens and I still read the book in just one day, but I dont know if I even want to bother with ever re-reading the first three or Midnight Sun when it comes out knowing what happens later.</review>

<review id="7450">Your mileage may vary, but I feel the pain of the reviewer who went through two routers already. Been there.  Doing that. I bought the WGR614 as an upgrade to my MR814, which ran like a champ.  I had visions of blistering-fast wireless speed dancing in my head, since my Dell X300 has fast wi-fi built in. Set-up was a no-brainer on the first WGR614, but it croaked fifteen minutes later--just up and died.  Amazon's great return policy had a new one on my doorstep two days later.  This one isn't dead, but weeks later I am concluding that it is definitely ill. At least once a day I have to reset all of its information entirely.  Several times an hour, the router drops the connection--last night I was walking a staff member through a long Web-based project, and realized what a nightmare this router is in terms of reliability.  I have a rock-steady DSL connection, so that's not the problem (if I take the router out of the equation, all's well, but then, of course, I don't have wireless access for the other PCs in the house). I've switched the channel on my wireless phone and twiddled with other settings, but that didn't help.  Yes, it's fast, it's easy to set up, and it's compact. If yours is working, mazel tov.  I just don't have the patience any more.  I'm going to admit defeat and turn this in for another brand, and get by in the interim with my older router. I've been loyal to Netgear, and tried hard to stay loyal with this purchase, but I can't. (You can check my other Amazon reviews--I'm pretty generous with stuff I like.)  I need a router that works. Try again, Netgear.</review>

<review id="7451">I just bought an "Elite B40" brewer from Sears. At $100+ dollars, I'd expect better.First the positive:It's easy to clean- easy to use - brews a decent cup of coffee (not like a quality drip brewer though) - the controls are easy and there are tons of coffees available at a reasonable price (factoring in the convenience of the k-cups)...Now the negative:Due to a poorly designed pump mechanism, the noise this machine makes is truly unbelievable!!! It vibrates the whole counter and everything on it. It sounds like a DeWalt Hammer Drill, or for those potential customers who don't know what a hammer drill sounds like... it sounds like a cheap, handheld air compressor or like the air compressor at a gas station. No exaggeration! This thing will actually dance around the counter for the few seconds it takes to load the water into the heat chamber!I make my coffee in the morning around 5am. This vibration can literally be felt around the house and it wakes everyone up. I had to move the B40 to the garage so I wouldn't disturb people sleeping! Keurig Engineers obviously live alone or are hard of hearing to have designed such a noisy appliance! It's actually embarrassing to use when company is visiting and I end up using the good'ol (quiet) drip maker! We bought a Black & Decker Home Caf?pod machine which is similar to the B40, except it is very quiet and much smaller. It uses pods similar to the B40, but the coffee is weaker.The other draw back is it's size... It's almost as large as my Rotisserie Jr. It's also made entirely out of plastic, for $100+ dollars, I'd expect this thing to have some stainless steel on it!</review>

<review id="7452">I admit, I was caught up in the big Twilight craze for awhile. Who wasn't at one time, though? But as I grew in age, and thru many more read thru's of the books, I slowly began to realize how horrid these books are. Twilight was interesting in some parts, New Moon was bland, but Eclipse was just plain bad. Edward and Bella thought they would have their happy ending by now, right? Wrong. It seems there's been reports of strange killings, and they may be Vampiric killings. At the samet time, Bella is battling an inward battle as Jacob grows more attached to her then ever. Is she starting to fall for the raven haired Werewolf? Or are these feelings being pushed on her by Jacob himself? Sounds good right? I was actually interested to read about more tension between Bella and Jacob; and even Edward and Jacob. But, as I cannot seem to stress, it was weighed down by the following. Bella Swan is still the perfect example of a Mary Sue.Bella's relationship with Edward is full on 'addiction.' It seems the heroine cannot live one solitary moment without him, or thinking about being with him.  Apart from her 'addiction,' Bella is a pretty boring heroine indeed. She has no common goals, dreams; or hobbies to even speak of. Indeed, Edward in Eclipse is 'forcing' Bella to go to College, but she would rather just become a Vampire and live Happily Ever After. It's a sad day indeed when the Male is telling his Girlfriend she needs to go to College.In this day and age, women need to set goals to make it in this world. But Bella I'm afraid has none; apart from rereading 'Wuthering Heights' over and over again. Bella's an exasperating character, especially sense I've read other books with much better heroine's. Take for instance, Jane Eyre, Elizabeth Bennet, Emma Woodhouse, or the Dashwood sisters; all empowering heroine's who all face adversity with...what else..? Men. But here we have a heroine who does nothing but drool over her man. Even Hermoine Granger from Harry Potter has backbone; sharing her smarts and not being afraid to do anything. Something that also annoys me to no end is how Bella toys with Jacob. It's sickening, as Bella KNOWS Jacob is in love with her, and would do anything for her. How she often flip flops on her feelings towards him is annoying as well; and the 'steamy' embrace at the end was awkward and weird to read as a reader. Secondly, let's talk about Edward Cullen, our Vampire Hero. Edward himself is a male equivalent of the Mary Sue type. He's perfect, a god, and can do no wrong. Edward needs only to whisper a few words of love into our Heroine's ear; and she's swooning. Now, I'm a romantic girl, and typically a guy who speaks romantic things would make any girl swoon. But the phrases Edward utters are so overly gushy, one might gag upon contact. However, in Eclipse, gone is the romantic; hello over protective stalkerish boyfriend. Edward cannot seem to stand it when Bella visits with her friend Jacob, so much that he goes and does something to the tires so she cannot go visit him. If my boyfriend ever did something like this, I'd kick his behind to the curb. Edward in Eclipse comes off as jealous and clingy. And while a jealous guy usally makes for an interesting read, here it's over done. Shall I say more? Ms. Meyer's characters are one-dimensional, and one cannot seem to ever fully care for these people. If a person doesn't care for the characters, and the current situation, one should just put the book away. If you don't 'care' for something, you needn't continue it. Now I must admit, Ms. Meyer can write good when she wants too. Jasper and Rosalie's backstories are wonderful parts, but not enough to save a 600+ page book. Which makes for another point; the book is far too long. There's not enough action, there's much too much tension between the main characters. At least Twilight had a crazed Vampire killer, New Moon had a car theft; but Eclipse has nothing but overly cheesy dialouge. Also, the 'steamy' scenes with Edward and Bella are uneeded. Don't get me wrong, I've read worse, but in here these things came off as rushed and uneeded. Eclipse is like the censored, edited, and teen age bodice ripper. I suggest you read some real romantic books with great, smart, Heroine's. Try Jane Eyre, Sense and Sensiblity, Wuthering Heights, or even Pride and Prejudice. Once you enter these worlds, you'll never want to leave. FYI, Twilight, and Ms. Meyer cannot touch J.K. Rowling. I really do wish everyone would stop saying Ms. Meyer is the new Rowling! I now fully expect the fangirls to come at me with pitchforks. And as for what I want to happen in 'Breaking Dawn?' Edward leaves Bella for Jacob. THAT would be a good book!</review>

<review id="7453">In my opinion, this is a giant step backward for Microsoft software. It is radically different from previous versions, much less intuitive, and more complicated to use. I'm staying with 2003!</review>

<review id="7455">I worked with my dogs on this toy for several days. Using it as an interactive toy we played tug, and the rubber stopper became wedged tightly so that it sealed the hole, trapping the kibble inside. The goodies inside would only fall out when the rubber stopper and straw was in a very specific position, AND the straw-like piece had grabbed the treat and pulled it through the hole, AND the bottle had to be upside down. This was something that my dogs could not possibly do with their mouth, tongue, and feet. They would pick it up by the rubbery end, sniffing and chewing at the rubbery purple parts, making it impossible to use gravity to allow the tiny treats to fall out, let alone accomplish the amazing "straw grabber" feat described above. Of course with no reward the motivation waned. Even my highly intelligent dog got frustrated and then became indifferent. After I had left the room for 10 minutes, my other dog had chewed up the purple rubber stopper and straw, and transformed the already useless toy into just a bottle with a small hole and no rubber stopper. Don't waste your money. I'm not impressed with the other two toys (by this maker) that I bought: busy bouncy bone, and busy bristle bone. (see my other reviews)</review>

<review id="7456">This didn't give a very good shave. Did the job for a while without complaint but then got dull real fast. After a year or so the pop-up trimmer stopped working. They say you can clean with water but I think the water rusted the spring on the pop-up or something. My Braun has lasted longer and is much easier to clean. These microscreens don't rinse out too well. You still have to dig in and clean stuff out. My Braun rinses clean and after 2 year without replacing anything it still gives a good shave.</review>

<review id="7457">Well, when I first got my Lachesis everything seemed fine. I started to notice the cursor would jump randomly. Finally 3 weeks later, Razer released the new firmware. It sorta fixed the jumping, but the mouse still seems messed up. When I restart my computer the mouse is always off and I have to unplug it and plug it in again. Also, the driver has lots of errors and will cause several access violations crashing your computer. I am running Windows XP MediaCenter and While I had the driver installed I would get blue screened every 15 mintues. Uninstalled the driver and bam no more violations or blue screens. If you want a stable product get something from Ideazon or Logitech. The only thing I really like about this product is the feel, it fits my hand much better then any other mouse I have ever used.</review>

<review id="7458">I have 2 Corgis, and also foster for Corgi Rescue. So far none of the four dogs I have had since buying this toy (my 2 plus 2 rescues) have played with it for more than a few minutes. They are all otherwise high energy, playful, food driven dogs.They LOVE Tricky Treat, Buster Cube and MolecuBall so I thought this would be a nice change. Big expensive yawn. I gave it two stars only because it appears well made. I bought it almost a year ago, and kept it around in case one of the foster Corgis might like it, but so far nothing. It is currently in the donate to the animal shelter box.</review>

<review id="7459">I should have read more reviews before I bought this, because after a few weeks on my keychain, the end broke off cleanly.  The unit still works, so I'm going to attempt to superglue it on, but I'm disappointed.  For something that claims to be washer and dryer "safe", it's very fragile. The hole for the keychain ring should extend through the PCB, not the soft white plastic cover.  I'm glad I didn't lose my data, but I'm not sure I'll trust this with anything important from here on.</review>

<review id="7461">This hard drive looks nice, it feels nice, but it has NO DURABILITY!! If you already have this hard drive, DO NOT leave it connected for a whole day as I did when downloading large files!! If you do, then what will first happen is that the speed will diminish to usb 1.0 instead of 2.0, slowing down the file transfer by a lot! Then after continued use and overheating (I assume overheating because I have never dropped it or really moved it in months)it will start to show an i/o error (input/output). This causes some errors when either transferring files or copying them. After more use though, when it is connected to a computer, it shows up, but the drive cannot be accessed and neither can any information be found on it!! I lost all of my critical files that I needed! And data recovery is freakin expensive! Bottom price is $300 and it goes up from there depending on how extent the damage is. DO NOT OPEN IT YOURSELF as it will void the 3 year warranty and you will not be able to get your money back! Save your money for a better hard drive and ALL WAYS MAKE A BACKUP FOR YOUR FILES! Don't procrastinate and make backups now, as I learned the hard way... Other than that this is a pretty good hard drive!</review>

<review id="7463">If I wanted to brush up on theology there are a lot of great theologians who have done a much better job of explaining theology than Wm Paul Young ever will. In fact, some of his theological points are inaccurate and misleading. I would go so far as to say that Young's book is actually dangerous in that it is leading Christians in to heresy concerning the Trinity, the incarnation, free will, etc. Just a caution, don't check your brain at the door if you are going to read this book. Let Scripture and not Mr. Young inform your view of God. [...]</review>

<review id="7464">A financial software such as Quicken is suppose to make your life easier, which it was doing that when it first came out in the 15 years ago. But Intuit has slowly added a lot of "features" to Quicken over the years and made it more complex than it doesn't really need to be as a personal/small business financial software.Each upgrade is not seamless, there's always something that doesn't match during the upgrade. Then you have to spend your valuable time to changes the unmatched records from the previous version to the upgrade. Now, Intuit is forcing the owner of Quicken 2006 to upgrade to 2009 by shouting down 2006 online features. That is an unethical tactic by any measurements.There are only so many feature you need in a personal/small business financial software. Yet, Intuit is coming up "new feature" every year, which is fine for new user. But forcing the previous owners to upgrade by shouting down the services that was already sold? That is just low.Intuit, DO NOT BITE THE HANDS THAT FEED YOU. We've supported you over 15 years. If you shout down the services we've already bought, we WILL file a class action law suit.</review>

<review id="7465">The machine makes a nice white noise sound which is adjustabel in "tone", but not volume.   I found it much too loud for our bedroom.  So loud that it kept us awake.   If you are looking for a soft background noise machine do not buy this.</review>

<review id="7469">I needed a removable hard drive to backup my data and then store off site.  I bought this and the Western Digital WDH1CS5000N 500GB My Book Home Edition External Hard Drive  After using both for the last two weeks, I clearly prefer the Western Digital.  It is, or was when I bought it, $20 more.  However, it has firewire and can be daisy chained.  A very nice advantage.The Seagate is a much taller drive and has that funky base.  It seems more likely to topple over, although it hasn't.  I can do without the slowing 'flashing' activity light bar on the front too.I'm not sure I'll go through the trouble to return it but I definitely recommend the Western Digital over this one.</review>

<review id="7470">I do computer repairs.I normally don't like to see reviews that rate a product with only one star because they got an "out of box failure" but I will have to add myself to the category of people that will not give a product the benefit of a doubt.I already have a 500gb Maxtor that has worked perfectly. I back up a lot of customers machines in my line of work and like to keep their data for a few months in the event they have a failure, so that was the reason I needed even a larger external hard drive. Also I liked the fact this had an esata connection for my own personal computer. I plugged the power in and started hearing a double clicking sound. It didn't sound good from my experience with hard drives. I then connected the USB connector. Nothing happened. I waited a while longer and, pulled up the directory and the drive was there. Created a folder and ran across the instructions again. It should have installed the software when the USB was connected.So I shut it down (and powered down), rebooted my computer and went through the same process again. This time it worked as expected. No clicking sounds... just normal drive activity. It installed the software automatically. Good... I was happy... must have just been a fluke.A few seconds later I got an error, "delayed write failure" and an explanation the data was not written.I've never been too impressed with Seagate. I always liked Maxtor (before they were bought out) better with Western Digital in second place. I decided to give it another chance. I uninstalled the software, ran a scan on the registry and cleaned it up. Started all over again with a new USB port, just to be safe. Exact same thing as my first experience. Started the double clicking sound, pause, then double clicking sound. Once again, Seagate is not up to prime time. It will probably be a number of years before I try Seagate again. Too bad, because I like the company as I know some people that work there. I think the engineering is top of the line but production must really suffer. Amazon reviews are so valuable. A quick search found the delayed write failure a common problem when it dies. I took it back (BestBuy) and got a 1 tb Western Digital (My Book). It is very quite... a little larger than the Seagate (about the size of my Maxtor), and much quieter (almost no sound) operation than my Maxtor and Seagate (when it wasn't clicking, but simply accessing data). I've only had the WD for a couple of hours so I can't attest to the software or how it will perform in the future, but I can say that I have been very pleased with the Maxtor. I've had the Maxtor for about a year. Just looking at the reviews here and my own experience, I would say avoid this product... especially this model.</review>

<review id="7471">i bought this item because its effulgent no-costs-barred exterior speaks of quality, and i believed it. the U3 software was a nuisance to get rid of (i'm a mac user, and it required that i hunt down a pc-using friend), but i managed. i still have un-deletable crap on the disk, though...apparently i don't have the "privileges" required! and within weeks, the hardware started malfunctioning: once mounted, it was impossible to unmount the disk except by restarting my computer and yanking the cruzer out of the usb port while the system was down. if the computer goes to sleep with the stick in it, all bets are off; click on the icon and you get the spinning wheel of death that heralds whinces and pangs for mac users everywhere. it's actually crashed my (otherwise bulletproof) G4 no fewer than 5 times. my advice to mac users: get a kingston--they're cheaper, and there's no obnoxious self-perpetuating software bundle.</review>

<review id="7473">to answer the question, the difference appears to be Enron got caught.  Every year Turbotax gets a little sneakier in their marketing efforts.  The last two years, I noticed I could buy Turbotax cheaper through Amazon.com and at Office Deport than from their emailed "promotional" price, so I did.  This year, it is the same (about a 20% savings).  You would think if you come back each year, they would give you a discount.  Or, if you already have a downlaoded copy installed, they would provide an update to convert you to the next year forms which would provide an incentive to being a loyal customer.  But no, these slimeballs charge you more each year.  Well, no more for me.  The E-file feature does me no good, as my return has to be physically mailed due to the number and type of forms used.  It is not hard to set up an Excel program to do your calculations which I've done any way in order to crosscheck the Turbotax numbers.  I also understand TaxCut can upload prior Turbotax returns so I may go that route.  Basically, after using Turbotax for nine years, I'm tired of being ripped off and treated like a gullible idiot.</review>

<review id="7474">The new MacBooks were out and boy was I ever excited. I watched Steve Jobs' performance, saw the machines were really and truly to die for, just like he was saying they were. These were the next best thing since sliced bread. I had to have one and I had to have it now. I went right online to the Apple store and ordered mine right up. Then I did my last backup of my fifteen inch MacBook, a machine I really loved, but I was going to love the new one so much more, so backup complete, I put my baby on eBay and seven days later I packed it up and shipped it out.And for a whole two days I was sans MacBook, but then I got the knock. The FedEx guy was at the door with my new MacBook. I was one happy girl. Okay, I was a little disappointed to see I couldn't hook my new baby up to my twenty-three inch Apple Cinema Display, because Apple changed the connection on the new MacBooks and they didn't supply an adapter and only one company makes those adapters. Guess who? You guessed it. Apple! Was this a way to sneakily get a little extra money for their new machines? Shame on you Mr. Jobs.My neighbors are in Paris for three weeks and I'm watching their daughters while they are away, they're six and eight and they were as excited as me about my new toy. The really loved the bright screen, the way the colors just pop out at you. And that night we lay in my double bed, me in the middle, a girl on each side, lights out as we watched Monster's Inc, then Robots. What a beautiful machine for watching movies on in the dark. What a beautiful display, what eye popping color, there is just no better way to cuddle up with a couple children and watch a movie.And if I was a guy I could throw away my bathroom mirror and shave with that display. I can't work with it in any kind of light though, but it's perfect for checking my makeup. And I don't really like Leopard all that much. I was running Tiger 10.4.11 and loving it. Fast it was, faster than this, especially with my virtual machines.Oh how I wished I had my old baby back. What a stupid display. How come I didn't think about glossy versus matte. Glossy is fine for movies in the dark, fine for shaving too, I suppose, but not fine for working at twenty-some thousand feet with all those overhead lights on. I suppose I could ask the flight attendant to ask all the other passengers to shut 'em off. I suppose when I'm working out on the patio I could sort of rotate my machine as the sun rotates in the sky.What to do, what to do? I'll tell you what I did. I e-mailed the guy who stole my baby from me via that eBay auction and asked him would he like to trade for an almost brand spanking new MacBook that only went on one short flight with me and two little girls to San Francisco and back. He wanted to know what was the catch. I told him I hated the screen. He said he'd call FedEx straightaway. I told him I would too. The machines, the old and the new, probably passed each other somewhere over Kansas or Iowa. Now I've got my old baby back, am out a few hundred dollars, but I'm a little wiser now. Matte makes a difference. If you're going to be looking at a screen all day, glossy is not the way to go. Five stars for the nice design, minus two stars for the screen and minus another star for not putting in that video connector, which I threw in when I traded and got my baby back, and that leaves two stars and I'm being generous.I love you Apple, I really do, but you missed the boat with this one.Reviewed by Stephanie Sane</review>

<review id="7475">I have not been able to use this product since I was planning to convert my data from Quicken 2009 to QuickBooks 2009.  You would think that Intuit would have worried about conversion from their own software, but obviously not.  Quicken support is practically impossible to reach.  I had to purchase Quicken 2009 because I could not reach Quicken support to figure out how to move my Quicken 2007 from one computer to another.  MISERABLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT FROM INTUIT.</review>

<review id="7476">I had read all the reviews that said, "this is just a USB stick that can play MP3s. Don't expect a fancy interface." Because it was so cheap, I figured, "why not?"Well, I am returning mine. Don't get me wrong, it plays mp3s like it's supposed to. But after using the Sansa model of mp3 players, I'm spoiled --- I like an interface that allows me to select mp3s quickly. I just found this one to be too bare-bones.</review>

<review id="7477">I think it is great that all the other reviewers (and their pets) have had positive experiences with this product. I, unfortunately, have not. I left my 65 lb dog in his crate for 45 minutes only to come home to the wire on the door having broken welds and the wire bent up at my dog's eye level. I understand that some dogs will be able to damage their crates, I just feel that the crate should withstand my dog trying to reach a toy that ended up outside of his crate. This damage has not only made this brand new crate unusable, my dog could have been seriously injured had he been left for a longer period. To make it worse, I was told by MidWest's customer service that the warranty will not cover anything because the damage was inflicted by the animal. I was told I should have "more thoroughly inspected the crate for any defects prior" to leaving my animal in it. So I guess I was supposed to check every single weld on every single wire on the entire crate before use. That is ridiculous. Further, no parts are replaceable (except the tray) and it is not possible to order a new door. I was told to go purchase a new crate at full price. Be careful with this product. Apparently the warranty is void once your animal has been inside the crate. I gave it one star only because zero stars was not an option.</review>

<review id="7478">The drive indicates it has 1 gb of space but only holds about half of that... I returned it for a refund.  Amazon was very good about quickly responding to the problem.</review>

<review id="7479">This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [HD DVD] (HD DVD)      I am very unhappy with this product.  I purchased the set as a Christmas gift for my husband only to find that it would not play in out HD DVD player. There was no mention of the special viewing device needed. This product was returned & I purchased a different copy that does play for us.</review>

<review id="7480">For the record, I am dictating this review, using MacSpeech Dictate. As others have done, I will leave in any errors period. (Like that one!)Four [for] years, I had hoped that someone would develop a voice recognition program for the Mac that was as good as Dragon NaturallySpeaking (now you want us [Nuance]) both ViaVoice and I listen [iListen] were just terrible products, so bad that basically they didn't work at all. This was because they were based on the Phillips "engine". It just so happens that I got my new quad core Mac Pro desktop at the same time that MacSpeech announced the new Dictate program based on the drag and [Dragon] voice recognition system.As others have mentioned, the MacSpeech customer service department is completely not functioning. I just don't know what else there is to say. They can NOT be reached by any means.Furthermore, this is not  the feature complete version of this product, which I hope ships as soon as possible and should be free to those of us who have purchased version 1.0.I can't assign a percentage of successful recognition. If you read through this review you can see that although it gets a lot of things right, it also makes significant number of mistakes. Actually, that would be okay if there were some form of correction/teaching built into the product, but as of yet, there is not. Also, some commands which are listed in the program are not functional as of yet.(Such as spell checking)New(it's(I was trying to say "new line")one thing I should mention, is that I am still using my old Telex had said [headset] and that I plan to update to a new headset. I have no idea how many stars to give this product at this point. I ordered this version, which is effectively a prerelease version that was rushed to market in order to capitalize on the momentum of announcing the product at MacWorld, in order to take advantage of the $79 "cross grade" price for those of us poor chumps who were stuck with ViaVoice/iListen.I would not order this program at the present time, instead I think it would be better to wait for the updated, full-featured version and period.</review>

<review id="7481">Online banking & matching credit card transactions worked just great in my 2007 version, I have no idea how they could have destroyed something so badly in two versions. Way too many graphics, feels bloated, and lacking features that were in previous versions. Why on earth do i have to close other windows when matching transactions? The 2010 version of Quickbooks should include a pop up blocker for all the annoying ads that pop up on my screen trying to sell me on payroll services, credit card services, WEB HOSTING?!?!?, and other silly crap that eats up resources on my computer and prevents me from getting my accounting done. I already don't like to do accounting, Quickbooks 2009 just exacerbates it. I'm going back to the 2007 version until Intuit decides I can't do online banking with it any more. Then I'm switching to another product.Save your money, don't upgrade. Newer is NOT better!</review>

<review id="7484">D-Link DPH-50U Skype USB Phone AdapterThis product has given nothing but trouble. The main problem is that it crashes in the middle of most calls that last longer than a few minutes. After downloading new software from the d-link web site the problem still persisted. When I contacted d-link I was told that the software hadn't been updated to work with Windows XP SP3 and that I would have to remove it and reinstall SP2. Furthermore, nothing on the d-link web site warned the potential buyer of this problem. Advice - don't touch it with a ten foot pole.</review>

<review id="7485">I purchased this model. It worked fine for 2 days. The head/micro screen broke off. I returned and got a new one. After 4 days of minimal usage the micro screen broke off again. Head is poorly designed. Love the portablity of it and ease of use but till they fix the head design its not worth the big bucks at this time.</review>

<review id="7486">Bad News:The USB & Firewire  connectors for this model Canon HV30 camera do not function well with  Windows XP or Vista.  This HV30 works great with MACs and formerly  worked well with the old Windows XP before SP1.Most relevant issues:[..]Ok, before you click that...its big. It is a 13 pages of people giving various complaints about the HV30. There are dozens of similar people to us who have this same problem with the Windows & this damn HV30. Apparently it works very well with Mac. It works poorly with Vista & XP.   The short version of it is this:FireWire is a high-speed transfer mechanism on 1394 interface. Microsoft has been developing several security patches to this. Those patches interfere with the communication of the camcorder with the computer.  The very earliest version of Windows XP did ok, but nothing after Service Pack 2. Microsoft has claimed the problem is the fault of Canon.  Canon claims the fault is Microsoft. The camera suppliers just say its not our problem.One of the most notable problems......Canon's website does not have ANY drivers/software/links  for this HV30 ....they expect it to magically work right out of the box (which is obviously does not for many people).  There was one workaround fix that a smart guy had, and I got the camcorder to be recognized on the computer as the CanonHV30 , but it only lasts for 5minutes before the microsoft standard setting resets itself. I tried on 3 of my computers....same result each time.  Windows XP & Vista will not recognize the camcorder on the USB or FireWire  wires.I have also tried several of the un-official ugly "tweaks" that were mentioned on those forums, none worked.I cannot see any solution to it. Options I did not try.  I do not have a mini-SD card here.  I am guessing that if you could record your pictures and videos directly onto the mini SD card ...you could then remove the card from the camcorder and insert that into the computer. (thus you would not need the  USB or FireWire interface). But I think the recording time of those things is small in comparison to the DV Tape you have in there now. Other option would be to connect the camera up to a MAC, save the video file there on the mac, then burn it to disc, then put that disc into your home PC and edit the video. Advise: Get a more reliable brand! or tell CANON to put themselves to work to improve this issue.</review>

<review id="7487">USED IT FOR YEARS, THIS YEAR AFTER SENDING IN FORMS I FOUND IT HAD MADE MISTAKES, FILLED OUT ON WRONG FORMS, HAD TO GO SEE IRS OFFICE, AND THEY HAVE ME FILLING IN AMMENDED FORMS BY LONG HAND, AS TAX CUT DOES NOT SUPPORT AMMENDED FORMS, IT HAS BEEN VERY STRESSFUL  AND I WILL NOT USE TAX CUT AGAIN.

<review id="7488">I have been a user of Turbotax for decades.  I was just about to buy 2008 version when I read about the extra charges that Turbo Tax has sneaked in.  I prepare taxes for my 95 year old stepmother and two student sons.  Under their new "improved (for them)" plan, I will have to pay $54 plus an additional $30...that's $45 more than last year.  I consider this a terrible rip off and I am not going to continue to deal with Intuit in any manner.An Unhappy Wisconsin Ex customer</review>

<review id="7489">I have used this product for 20 years and agree with many of the other reviewers.  The not-so-hidden price increases are becoming intolerable.  They actually would be a bit more tolerable if Intuit could come right out and say that they are increasing the price due to such-and-such reason.  But to hide the price increases behind feature changes is sneaky.  There has been a pattern of this for quite a while.  I have been surprised a couple times in past years to find that a feature I had used in a prior year was no longer available in the current version and I had to "upgrade" to the next higher version to get the feature I had been using in the past.  I would find myself halfway through the data entry process doing the online upgrade (along with the extra charges) to gain back the features that I needed.I will be looking into other products.</review>

<review id="7490">I think my dog is just too intelligent for this.  She quickly figured out that she could just bark until the citronella runs out...which was just a small annoyance, not really a deterrant.  She also was able to shift the collar's position so it didn't spray her straight in the face.  The citronella collar might work for a dumb dog but not for my australian shephard.</review>

<review id="7491">I am not that happy with this litter box.  I only bought it because of the reviews it got here.  I thought that since I had tendonitis it would do away with scooping and save the stress on my arm.  Well...A lot of the litter sticks to the bottom, making it necessary to bang and bang hard on the bottom to free it, and some of it still sticks.  And you can't see what's happening, since you have to keep the lid on.  I have had to kneel down with a flashlight to see inside.  Then, somehow the dirty litter gets stuck behind the receptacle and boy is that fun to remove. All this banging and kneeling and twisting is harder on my muscles than scooping!  I am disappointed; this was a $40 outlay for a product that, once again, fails to live up to its claims.</review>

<review id="7492">I never found S.M. to be a brillent writer, or an author who will be remembered for anything more than a so-so young adult novel. However, her first book had a certain sparkle that enabled me to over look her very raw writing ablility. Sadly, she has successfully destroyed all that was good about the first book by attempting these sequels. She ought to have left well enough alone and quit while she was ahead. It is completely unacceptable for a published novel to contain as many gramtical errors and typos as this one does. S.M. needs to take the time to go through her work after her proof reader. I have a hard time taking an author seriously if they don't even care enough about their work to make SURE what they have written is readable.         Instead of growing and improving as an author she, astoundingly, is growing worse. The plot has become cheesy, melodramatic, and trite. It says nothing original, and does nothing original. Bella is a feminist nightmare. If you are looking for something with meaning and depth or even just a tolerable light read, don't turn to this series for it.</review>

<review id="7493">It worked fine for 11 months.  Went to shave and it was dead even though it had been charging for most of the day.  I researched and found other people had same problem.  I am dreading the hassle I know awaits me of trying to get this fixed.  Sorry Braun, for years I used your products but $200+ for 11 months can by me a lot of disposable razors.  Before buying read the reviews (1 star and 2 star) to balance out the higher scores.  I rated it highly too, at first.</review>

<review id="7494">This can NOT be 600 Thread Count. It is super thin and is not as soft as the $12.00 bed sheets I bought at Wal-Mart.  The sheets look nice, but that is where it ends.  Not happy paying so much money for poor quality.</review>

<review id="7495">Product worked as well as my previous Ipods for the 1 1/2 hours I kept it.  Unfortunately, due to a change in the power configuration to save a few cents by Apple, the Ipod would not recharge from either of my car adapters or an Altec Lansing iM3 speaker system.  Don't buy this product unless you are willing to replace your accessories or buy an expensive and unwieldy adapter.  Your money, your choice!</review>

<review id="7496">I bought this product to replace an old WaterPik (model 49)-- a great piece of machinery that I would have kept on using, except that the plastic hose leading from the water well to the appliance tip split and couldn't be replaced.  This new model is remarkably inferior.  I can barely feel the water pressure generated, even with the most focused tip and with the highest setting.I sent a complaint to WaterPik, via their website and have yet to hear back.I would never recommend anyone buy this product.</review>

<review id="7497">The Comfort Zone diffuser did not make any detectable difference in our cats spraying problem.  I had such high hopes because every single product review I found was so positive!

<review id="7500">Microsoft has a nasty habit of arbitrarily moving and adjusting elements of its popular applications with each upgrade; however, I have never seen anything as bad as this before.  Anyone who spends any semi-serious time using Office is going to have a really bad time trying to figure out how to use this new version.  I have to be honest - I only tried working with Word and didn't even get to PowerPoint or Excel.  I had to stop before doing every little action and figure out how to do it.  EVERY.  SINGLE.  ACTION.  And some functions are just not there (or I couldn't find them).  I'm pretty good with figuring out how to use software on my own, but after a couple of hours with Word 2007 I just gave up and reinstalled Word 2003 on my new PC.  I cannot tell you how frustrating it was to try to use this program.  If major corporations try to upgrade to this new version, their office activities are going to come to a dead, screeching halt.   I suspect this 2007 version of Word will go the same way as Word 2002 -- quickly replaced with a newer (like the older I hope) version.  Otherwise, I'm looking to find some new software.</review>

<review id="7501">This book was a disappointment.  I have enjoyed the campy Twilight series.  It is that sort of read you can have on an airplane or a book you can read when you just want someone to give you a happy entertaining story.  I know when I read a story like this it is akin to eating fast food.  I am not looking for intellectual nutrition, but at the same time I don't want to be able to predict everything that is going to happen in the book during the firs three chapters.  Unfortunately this book did nothing for me.  I was hoping to end the Twilight series on a much higher note.  That said if you liked the first three books in this fun innocuous series, then go ahead read this one too, just throw away your expectations and hopes.</review>

<review id="7502">As a long time user of Watepik the only problem  I have had is quality, so when this new model was introduced I purchased it thinking improvements had been made. It is quieter but everything else lacks the quality I would expect in a new model costing almost $50. Additionally none of the previous attachments fit, so if you have had 1 or more older models you cannot reuse the attachments.</review>

<review id="7503">I have had nothing but trouble with my camera, and what's worse, when I sent my camera back, they lost it! I can no longer get hold of them on the phone. I see the house of cards starting to tumble. Caveat Emptor!</review>

<review id="7504">This review is from: Wall-E (Three-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)      The movie Wall-E is a great movie!  However, the DVD "special edition" (non-blue-ray) does not contain a DTS audio track that is common in other special editions.  Disney did however include a DTS-HD track on the blue-ray regular and special editions.  Amazon also covers this up by vaguely referring to the specifications of the both the blue-ray version and the regular dvd edition.  Additionally, Disney also left off the disney home theater audio track that accompanies other special editions... this must be so that Disney can re-release Wall-E in the future... with a "Specialer" Special Edition...  brilliant marketing Disney!</review>

<review id="7505">1 star is far too high for this junk.I installed it this morning.  The screens were blurry and hard to read.  I used to be able to read my email from halfway across the room.  Now I have to squint and get up close.  Everything is low contrast, the fonts are blurry, the menus are byzantine at best.  From an useability standpoint we were better off with WORDSTAR.  After a few painful hours trying to figure out how too make the software minimally useable I've uninstalled it and am reinstalling 2003.  Even if I lose all my settings and old emails, it will be worth it.  Heck, it would be worth it to roll all the way back to DOS to avoid this ill-conceived piece of junk. For the record, I've got a high-powered machine with dual high quality monitors, this isn't a hardware issue.  If I display Office 2007 on the right monitor and something else on the left, I can easily read the left monitor, but not the stuff from Office on the right.  This happens even when the fonts are smaller on the left monitor.</review>

<review id="7506">Set up was a breeze, I really liked the software easy to use, but over the next couple of days my connection started dying out. I hooked up my router to a PC and then I use internet on my laptop and my iMac, from at most 40 feet away through two floors. Now whenever I am online I have to refresh a page at least 3 times until it will load, it is so slow, I wish i had my old one back. By the way the phone support was horrible, 40 minutes of my life I will never get back. I also pinged my router and it said I lose 0% of my connection, so I have no idea what the problem is, but I know it's something with the router</review>

<review id="7507">My original review was deleted.  I am a CPA and was a loyal TT user since the days of Chipsoft.  The latest changes are unbearable: high cost, return printing restrictions unless you want to pay more to print additional returns...etc. etc.  I switched to Tax Cut and it works fine.  The cost is much lower, all the forms are there and you are not limited on returns you can print.  Tax Cut with business capability comes with all the state forms also and cost 1/2 of TT.  I'm glad I made the switch.</review>

<review id="7508">I don't do dark.  True, occasionally I'll find something dark I do enjoy, but that is the rare exception.  There's a reason I stick to family entertainment, I truly enjoy it.Which is why I was so surprised I enjoyed Batman Begins when it hit the theaters three years ago.  Despite the dark tone of the preview for this movie, I decided to see it.  I'm sorry I did.The criminal element in Gotham City is on the run.  It's really a triple effort thanks to Batman (Christian Bale), Lieutenant Gordon (Gary Oldman), and new DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).But just as they are centering in on the leaders of organized crime, a new villain emerges.  The Joker (Heath Ledger) is attempting to become the next leader, getting all the other criminals behind him.  And as he wins their confidence, things get worse in the city.  Can Batman save the day?The movie started out fine with a few laughs to lighten the mood and an interesting story.  But as it progressed, it really fell apart.Part of the problem was the overly gruesome nature.  Oh, I'll grant you that there was little if any blood.  But there were still some images that were truly horrific.  How this movie escaped the R rating it deserved is beyond me.Then there are the story issues.  The writers bit off more story then they could chew, even in two and a half hours.  Complicating the problem is the random nature of the Joker.  The end result is a movie that feels so scattered in the final hour it's hard to figure out what any one's motives are any more.One of the things I enjoyed the most about the last movie was the character development.  Here, it's completely lacking.  It would have taken away too much from the gruesome images and explosions, I guess.  Instead, we get a few attempts at development, all of which come across as forced and trite.But I can't blame that on the writer alone.  I honestly felt like most of the cast was just going through the motions, making it hard for me to find anything to grab on to.  Potential love interest Rachel Dawes was one of my favorite characters in the first movie.  The roll is taken over here by Maggie Gyllenhaal who is only passable.  One of the few exceptions was Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent.The other exception was the late Heath Ledger.  He was brilliant as the Joker.  I couldn't look away when he was on screen even if I wanted to.  All the praise he has gotten for the part is well deserved.  In fact, his acting job earns the movie its second star.Now I know what you are thinking, "What did you expect from a movie with Dark in the title?"  And you're right, I have only myself to blame for sitting through it.  But if you are like me and don't like darker movies, take my experience to heart and walk away from this film.</review>

<review id="7509">Purchased this router for my new laptop and loved it for the 1st 15 minutes.  After that it failed to respond to any attempts to connect unless it was power cycled/rebooted.  spent two days on the phone with Linksys support after which they told me it was defective and needed to be replaced.  Amazon was great and promptly sent me a 2nd "identical" router.  It worked great for 1 day after which it began exhibiting the same behavior, which was that it needed a reboot every 15 minutes to function properly.  spent another day on the phone with Linksys which included a remote session via the tech who promptly called me back and told me the unit was defective and that I should return it and buy another brand or model next time.  Absolutely zero stars (it made me give it one) on this model, it's as buggy as mosquito season in Wisconsin.</review>

<review id="7510">I am an attorney and my wife is a tax attorney, and we have spent hours reverse engineering and confirming TurboTax software problems (with dummy numbers) last night to determine ONCE AGAIN that the brain trust at TurboTax is giving us bogus product.  I have used TurboTax since 2005 (only for the spread sheet aspects), and, now that the IRS has made free online filing spreadsheet software available regardless of income (check out the new "Fillable Forms" at the IRS Free File website), THIS WILL OFFICIALLY BE THE LAST YEAR I USE THIS SOFTWARE.  Hooraahhh!  Every year I find numerous errors in their software (from mortgage interest deduction, to carry-overs, to properly completing non-cash charitable donations per IRS requirements, to calculating AMT credits, and now to yet another problem described here), and like many of you guys, every year that I write in about a problem I get one of their generic stupid replies from some low-level non-attorney who knows nothing about the tax code.  Like last year, I spend more time beta-testing their software bugs than actually doing my tax return.  [In other words, I easily computed and input all my data for our 2008 return this year, but I can not get TurboTax to generate (unless I start overriding everything . . . which can lead to other problems) this year's requisite Form 6251 for the AMT so that I can actually e-file my return.]  Unlike most people, we do our returns manually per the paper IRS forms, instructions, publications, and tax regs (again my wife is a tax lawyer), and then we input it all in TurboTax to e-file it . . . and like this year, I ALWAYS find major problems in their software.  For example, thousands of Americans are claiming a mortgage interest deduction on Schedule A that they are not entitled to due to the way TurboTax incorrectly distinguishes between home equity indebtedness and home acquisition indebtedness in the context of, e.g., refinanced primary mortgages that include a cash-out component, as well as due to the lack of direction in their menus about the need to compute average mortgage balances [they just generically refer you to the IRS publication, which no one tells me they have time to do . . . even my attorney friends don't refer to it and say they simply claim everything on their 1098 Mortgage Interest Statements (which is wrong!)].  And now this year, I wonder how many filers are not including Form 6251 (even if they do not owe AMT, the form must still be attached in many cases) due to this software bug that is not generating the Form.  As I say to all my friends, if you don't learn the tax code and check your taxes manually, you will be in trouble if you solely rely on any version of TurboTax . . . I have found that TurboTax has done my taxes wrong every year (2005, 2006, 2007, and now 2008).  As I said, now that there is no income requirement for completing your return online at the IRS website with their free tax spreadsheet Fillable Forms (brand new option this year!), I will be saying GOODBYE to wasting $30 a year on this software that my wife and I have to beta-test for days.  So Goodbye TurboTax. As an aside, I wonder how many tax attorneys they have on staff at Intuit??  [Not many I bet . . .  and that's the problem.  They have non-attorney software programmers trying to develop a set of questions that fails to account for important legal distinctions.]I have posted about this debacle as part of the following comment on a question thread I started at TurboTax's Live Community:FORM 6251 not being generated!MAJOR ERROR IN TURBOTAX DELUXE 2008!!My wife and I are attorneys (she is a tax attorney), and once again your software is saying I do not need to submit a Form 6251 when in fact I am REQUIRED by the Form 6251 Instructions to attach a Form 6251 to my return (even though I do not owe AMT this year, the form must still be generated and attached).I am required to attach the Form 6251 because, per the Instructions: "The total of Form 6251, lines 9 through 28, is negative and line 32 would be greater than line 35 if you did not take into account lines 9 through 28." In my case, all of our home mortgage interest is deductible under the regular tax this year, because all of our home equity debt (which happens to be used for investment) is less than 100K; thus, we do not need to complete the TurboTax questions (under the regular tax) for Investment Interest Expense (i.e., because we already are claiming all of this interest as home mortgage interest, we can not and do not need to take it again as investment interest expense simply because the proceeds happen to be used for investment). Thus, TurboTax correctly does not generate a Form 4952 for the regular tax.However, under the AMT regime, I need to enter values on lines 4 and 9 of Form 6251 to add the interest on the home equity debt back into my AMT income and then subtract it out of my AMT income as investment interest expense. I realize this is essentially a wash, but it does not exclude me from the requirement of filing the Form 6251. WHY IS TURBOTAX FAILING TO GENERATE AND E-FILE A FORM 6251 IN THIS CASE? Also, TurboTax should be generating a Form 4952-AMT (for my reference only of course), but IT IS NOT GENERATING ONE EITHER.Clearly, TurboTax's inquiry can't handle a situation where you are not claiming investment interest expense in the regular tax world (because it all qualifies as home equity debt), but then you need to claim it in the AMT tax world. PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP.TURBOTAX NEEDS TO GENERATE BOTH THE FORM 6251 AND FORM 4952-AMT IN SITUATIONS LIKE MINE.Follow-up Message from me to TurboTax programmers:You guys screwed up! Why do I have to beta-test your software every year!?!?!?I just sent you a detailed problem about Form 6251 not being generated. It turns out that at the beginning of the AMT questionnaire, there is an error in your Form 6251 worksheet programming. In response to the AMT question "Tell Us About Your Mortgage Interest," if I input a lower value for "Interest Paid on an Eligible Mortgage" (as compared to the home mortgage interest value from my regular tax Schedule A), then your software does not enter any "home mortgage interest adjustment" in the worksheet (and on line 4 of a Form 6251). Thus, no Form 6251 is being generated when in fact it is REQUIRED per the instructions to the Form 6251.Also, in prior years, there was always a question in TurboTax that would then ask you to adjust for any investment interest expense you might be able to claim under the AMT if any of this above ineligible interest happened to be used for investment (and therefore could be subtracted out on Line 9 of Form 6251).Shame on you TurboTax. I can't even correctly file my return this year until you fix this. I wonder how many people have already filed their taxes without Form 6251, even though they were required to do so (regardless of whether they owe AMT, the Form 6251 must still be attached in these cases).</review>

<review id="7511">This review is from: Wall-E (Three-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy and BD Live) [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)      Wall-e is a very weak movie. The plot is extremely thin, the characters (human or otherwise) are forgettable and, worst of all, it's boring.I can't see why people are calling it the best animated movie of all time. It doesn't work for adults because its plot is so childish and feeble, and it doesn't work for kids because it's just plain average.The proof is in the repeated viewing. My kids will (and indeed have) watch Toy Story, Monsters Inc, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, etc again and again and again. I can happily watch them again and again! They never get bored with those movies and they want a Buzz doll, a cuddly Nemo, the book of Monsters Inc... they just can't get enough.But they watched Wall-e once and maybe a half times more and that was it. No more interest. Back to Buzz and Woody and Sully and Crush.Let's just hope Pixar's next offering is better.</review>

<review id="7512">Bought this for my wife for Christmas, and she was very pleased. We weren't so pleased to find the battery won't charge. I had to wait until today, the 27th, for Tech support to be available, then told to call back the 29th to get an RMA# --  I'm a Mac user & when I buy PC's, I go Dell. This was a leap for me, but the specs, reviews, & price seemed good & my wife needed a very portable solution, so I'm giving ASUS a go. Naturally it's a major bummer to get a brand new product with problems, out of the box. "Apple" would have had a replacement battery in the mail already, as would Dell. Oh well, par for the course I expect. Will let you know what transpires :-)</review>

<review id="7513">We are on our second camera.  Both cameras were faulty causing movies to be trapped inside and lost FOREVER.  The customer service is SLOW and ineffective.  It takes days to get a call returned and the problem still doen't get fixed.  We would not reccommend going with this brand; not sure if the company is just too small or just don't care.  Either way, the customer loses.  We will be going with a nationally known company for qaulity equipment and better customer service from now on.</review>

<review id="7514">I saw this litter box online, and thought it sounded like a smart idea. However, it turns out to be less practical than I had hoped. 1. The clips that attach the hood to the base are very poorly constructed, so each time I roll the box, litter pours out of the seams and all over the floor.2. The waste tray doesn't quite fit the space properly, so clumps will often roll into the space at the end, or underneath the tray. This means I have to re-roll to catch clumps on a second attempt.3. If you roll too soon after your cat has used the litter tray (and there's a wet clump in there) the clump will stick to the grill, requiring some unpleasant cleaning!4. It's quite small, so if you have a larger cat then it will be a tight squeeze. My orange tabbies do fit in there, but only just.Overall, I would not recommend this product. I now use it like a regular litter tray, just taking the lid off and scooping it, instead of trying to roll it. I find that it's less work that way.</review>

<review id="7515">I received the worong hair iron. I had ordered a Generic Value Product hair iron because I was very satisfied with the one that I had bought at Sally's. It is the same as the CHI but cheaper. The one that was sent to me is a complete knock off with 2 name brands labeled on it. It burns the hair and does not work well! It is cheaply made and is evidently easily breakable. There is not even a knob to increase or decrease the heat intensity; meaning there is only one level of heat. Do not buy from this vendor.</review>

<review id="7517">I loved the first three books and couldn't wait for this one.  Now I wish the series had ended with Eclipse.  The first three books stressed sacrifice and making choices. Edward or Jacob?  Mortality and family or Immortality? No one has to lose anything here - everyone has everything they want fall relatively easily into their laps.The writing here is also a let down.  Much of the story reads like bad fanfiction.  Like, first, Bella and Edward get married.  Then the have lots of sex and then, like, they have a mixed vampire baby...  Edward is technically dead.  No beating heart, no circulating blood.  No mixed vampire babies.  And the way Jacob is released from his love for Bella?  Not just a cop-out, but also rather disgusting when you stop to think about it...  Very disappointing.</review>

<review id="7519">For the love all that is good in this world...run, do not walk, RUN away from this software.  Where should you run too? A copy of parallels, VM ware, or bootcamp and get the windows version of this program.  Since switching to the mac I have been frustrated with this "software".  It had been sometime since I had used personal financial software and the first time on a mac.  I thought man....this program seems worst than my 2002 version on windows.  After trying the usual suspects, liquid ledger, ibank, icash etc. I went to the windows 2008 version of quicken via parallels.  Oh my god!  the feature set is night and day.  The windows version has about 15 essential features that the mac shows no signs of ever attempting.Until intuit gets serious about the mac version stay away from this nonsense.</review>

<review id="7520">I bought this b/c my son is not able to sleep unswaddled and he gets tangled up in regular swaddling blankets (scary!). Unfortunately, it was a waste of money.  The blanket is not designed to swaddle tightly (which is the point) and my son is 9 lbs, 7 oz (clearly within the 7 - 14 lb range).  He got his arms loose and they flailed inside the blanket even after I stitched on additional velcro to make the swaddling tighter.  Unless your child doesn't wiggle at all, don't bother with this blanket.</review>

<review id="7521">The concept is great, but function and performance is poor.  I ordered the Flip for my wife for Xmas, but after reading the reviews, I decided to test it first.  The record and stop button would not work consistently and the uploading to the computer was a real test of patience.  I returned the product to Amazon and will pay the extra dollars to get a real camcorder.</review>

<review id="7522">If you would like a really good joystick for MS FS 2004, don't under any circumstances buy this one! I've had it for less than a month and it's already going wrong. Although the idea is a good one the joystick continually loses the wireless connection, despite the fact that I've got the transmitter sitting right next to it. You also find that the buttons fire off with out you even touching them so, as an example, you'll be flying a plane and all of a sudden the gear will descend for no reason at all. My advice is buy a USB joystick and leave this well alone.</review>

<review id="7523">The first model i got was all dented from shipping, i decided to use and bread came out flat.  I replaced it through amazon and the second model had no external dents but the internal oven was disconnected or hanging and i was afraid to use it.  Thge third model had large dent in fron but looked ok.  My wife and I followed the directions to a T, and the bread came out flat.  We decided to bake one more loaf and when i went to put in the yeast the yeast from the first batch was still in there, it never dispensed.  Biggest Hassle and waste of time.  Poor workmanship, cover feels like it will rip off.  Very very poor product packing</review>

<review id="7524">I've had the unit about a year. My wall adapter just died this morning for no reason. I like the shaver, but am not looking forward to dealing with costumer service and 2-3 weeks to get a replacement that in the end (from what I've read) I'm going to have to pay for anyways. I might just use a 12v adapter I have for an old CD player. I don't get it, wall mount power transformers are nothing new and are supposed to last pretty long. My god, I can still find junkers from the 60's that still work fine and have been sitting outdoors for years. Braun should be ashamed for selling out to the cheapest bidder on very standard part...</review>

<review id="7525">If you go buying this product with extremely low expectations you will be pleasantly surprised. It is quite a sleek mp3 player, extremely good price, and cool features. But I just had too many complaints to suggest this device.I bought the 8 gigabyte version at my work because I was soon to buy a Zune and the Coby was on sale for $50. I figured I would give it a chance. I like that it's shiny and the touch controls are cool and they glow! The little button on the top left is cool also it changes the view in some lists, really nice when you are looking at pictures. There is also preset EQ's which is nice. Comes with a nice suede case. But that is about where the pros end on this device.The menu is extremely bland but a lot of people don't care about that. Navigation is slow. The device will only respond to a hit in one direction so fast, so going through large lists is a pain. You can't change the background image. The way the music is organized is odd. If you go under artists then click on an artist it will list all the songs by that artist in alphabetical order. I couldn't find any way to change that, but if there is someone please correct me. If you just browse the device though under music though you can have it be organized Artist>Album since that's the way the folders are on the device. Getting album art to work with a mp3 player using WMP is a pain as well.The sound quality is also quite bad. I compared it to my 1st gen iriver clix with my J2 jbuds and it was very noticeable that the Coby sounded bad. Can't comment on the video quality because I didn't mess with it at all. Other than watch a few seconds of the videos on it.I was fine with everything about the device until I realized the sound quality was lacking... quality. I returned it the next day. I could imagine getting this for a younger kid with a decent size music collection. If you take your music somewhat seriously though I don't suggest the Coby. I have an 8gb Zune now and I am extremely happy.</review>

<review id="7527">I would give this program only one star except for one fact:  It doesn't crash and eat your data, and the backup settings are actually pretty good.  All that said, believe what you're reading in the other reviews:  the functionality of this program is terrible.1.)  You can't select more than one transaction at a time.  This is currently a problem for me because Quicken's insanely non-intuitive, confusing automatic download program just plunked three or four thousand of my credit card transactions into the wrong account.  So, I'm going to have to move them all one at a time, which is a time-consuming process without a keyboard shortcut.  I tried simply exporting the account containing my data for import into the correct account, but this didn't work - the import kept stalling out, until it finally quit.  I tried this three or four times, using different criteria, but it wouldn't work.  Something tells me Intuit will be amazingly non-responsive, should I attempt to contact them about this bug...More likely, I'll take another reviewer's suggestion and buy a copy of Parallel Desktop, so I can run an actual financial management program instead of this waste of $69. 2.) As others have mentioned, you can't sort transactions by many criteria at all.  You have to go through a number of confusing steps to create reports, etc., which makes the workaround for the problem difficult to use.BE WARNED - the 10.5.1 Leopard update broke my copy of Quicken, and tonight I wasted a couple of hours reinstalling Leopard from scratch, as it's nearly tax season and I need access to my financial records.There really aren't many other viable options for financial software for Mac.  This is definitely a market niche in need of a fill.  Until then we're stuck with this bomb.  Unfortunately.</review>

<review id="7528">I've been a fitness instructor for over 20 years.  I am not a trained dancer by any means.  And unless you are very used to taking dance classes, don't bother getting this DVD.  I was extremely disappointed.  AFter going thru the 1st routine, I realized it was going to take me so long to actually learn it, without really getting any kind of workout before, during, or after I learned it, that it was simply a frustrating waste of time.  This gal doesn't cue worth a flip, and changes moves at any given moment.  There are never repetitions for you to really get the move down and then put some intensity into it.  I stammered around on the 1st routine for 30 minutes and never broke a sweat.  So I switched over to my Turbo Jam DVD and got my butt whipped as usual in about 40 minutes of non-stop cardio moves with good instruction.  If you want to do a great cardio dance-type class, keep moving, and burn lots of calories, checkout the Beachbody.com DVDs, or Billy Blanks.  If you want to learn some complicated, ever-changing choreography, without too much physical exertion, then Tracy is your girl.</review>

<review id="7529">I bought this because, everyone said it was great.  I thought it was kind of expensive but I did by the furminator grooming kit which includes the shampoo and conditioner.  I did not think that the brush performed as specified.  It did work better on my Collie shepard mix than my German Shepard.  However,  I am able to remove more fur with just the rake and slicker brush.  When using the furminator it felt like the hair was being ripped from the dog.  My German Shepard does not like the brush and my collie mix tolerated but I don't think he really cared for it either. When I got the brush out again my Shepard ran away.The shampoo and conditioner did leave my dogs fur looking nice.  The shampoo smells like coconuts, and the conditioner was more floral, I am not sure who decided those two scents went well together. But over all the shampoo and treatment seemed to work well.  I am not sure that it added any reducing to the shedding.</review>

<review id="7530">I've wet shaved all my life except when I was a teenager, and I've always envied those who just grab an electric shaver, whisk it over their faces, and hit the door, so thought I'd try it. The Braun scored highest in quality and satisfaction, so I got this shaver, the top of the line, and gave it a go. I decided to keep at it for several weeks, since it takes time for the beard to become used to a new way of shaving, but by the time my 30 days in which I could get a full refund were up, I sent it back. As another user noted, I had to shave every which way to get at all close, and my skin felt hot afterward. Finally I pulled out my old Gillette Trac III razor and shaving cream and did a comparison test. The Braun couldn't hold a candle to the closeness and comfort afterward of a wet razor shave. So if you're into electric shavers, this is probably the best on the market, but if you're thinking of switching from wet shaving you might want to think again. The proof is in the feel of your face afterward, and there was really no comparison. I'm back to blades for good.</review>

<review id="7531">This computer is awesome hands down.  It is pretty fast for a computer this size.  BUT expect to have some problems with it when you open it up.  Two days after I received mine it would not turn on, the power light would come on but no display at all, and Acer wanted me to pay shipping for me to send it to them.  Following this guide [...] I was able to fix the issue.  My mother bought one 2 weeks after I did and hers was broken out of the box.  It would get in a reboot loop whenever you tried to shut it down.  I restored the unit 2x and upgraded the BIOS 3x but still no luck.  She is going to have to ship it out.  So IF you can get it running right like mine then you will have a blast with it!</review>

<review id="7532">You will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have. Don't expect to turn this version on and be able to use it. Many changes are literally imposed on you, like the ribbons instead of the familiar icon bars. Missing menus and the auto-double space setting every time you hit return. There are new features which can be helpful to some, but Microsoft probably thinks you can afford a week for retraining. The arrogance of Microsoft not even to offer the menus everyone is used to as a classic or traditional option is incredible. You upgrade for hundreds of dollars to get totally stuck and run out to buy a manual.</review>

<review id="7533">Like others that have recently gotten the IPOD Nano 4th Generation.  I understand the grief over the previous IPOD accessories that are no longer compatible.  I received my IPOD Nano (hot pink) for Christmas only because my 3rd Gen. Nano (hot pink) cr*pped out on me.  (the screen went out in only 2 years of owning.  Never dropped, not left in a hot car or anything like that)  Anywho....  I received in December due to holiday and since then my Nano has been playing my music like skipped CD's.  It cuts the song off 1/2 way through, skips through the songs, cuts off the ending of the song.  None of my music is pirated.  They all came from CDs (which I got rid of before I moved) or through ITunes.  It is completely random on which songs it will do it to during play and I've returned the IPOD to factory settings with the same results.  All songs worked splendidly on my 3rd generation and continue to work just fine in ITUNES.  I also don't appreciate the shake to change feature which becomes super annoying if you're jogging and forgot to turn it off.  It only works when it wants to.  Also, it doesn't help that the only thing I can charge my Nano on is my computer.  1/2 the time I'm not home to keep tabs on it. It's an okay product, but I'd rather stick with the 3rd generation.  Now I've got a Nano I can't rely on until I get another one which might end up being 'refurbished' from the factory.  And my IPOD IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY!  Apple needs to get it together and send a product that will be reliable and compatible with the previous accessories that were available, if not, at least put it within the marketing plan (which that probably won't happen)</review>

<review id="7536">The pedometer itself is OK. It tends to overestimate steps, but I don't think a perfect pedometer exists, short of attaching sensors to your legs. As long as you use the same one, it will presumably overestimate all the time, meaning you can at least compare measurements across the same pedometer.My main problem with this pedometer, and the cause for its low score, is how often this thing goes through batteries. I go through a battery every 3 weeks, so in a year, I expect I will go through almost 20 batteries. Yow! The pedometer itself may be relatively cheap, but 20 batteries a year for a glorified wrist watch is an amazing feat.I am not surprised to see that the Omron sometimes gets packaged with a set of replacement batteries. That's not a very good sign ...Anyway, buyer beware.</review>

<review id="7537">They changed everything!  In an effort to make it more user friendly, they've rearranged most of the controls.  Menus are replaced by headings.  It is difficult to accomplish what were easy changes before.  Some of this will likely improve with use.WORD 2007 is constantly trying to think for you, auto formatting as you type.  However, it often isn't thinking what you are, and making it obey your commands is frustrated by the new headings.  Particularly frustrating, when I "right-click" on a list to restart numbering at "A" (ie. after roman numeral II on an outline), WORD 2007 flatly refuses.  My research paper is now formated:I.   Heading  A. subpoint  B. subpoint  C. subpoinII.  Heading  D. subpoint  E. subpoint  F. subpointIII.  Heading  G. subpoint etc....etc...This is ridiculous and inexcusable!  I also had to individually superscript 130+ footnotes.  Somehow, in changing the font from the Widows default "Calibri" back to "Time New Roman," the footnote setting was altered and I have yet to determine how to restore it.  However, if I open a new document it is fine, but I really don't want to retype a 30+ page research paper.POWERPOINT 2007 works well enough, compared to the older version.  They have added a few bell and whistles, but nothing that gets in the way.If you have to buy a new computer you're likely stuck with the new MS Office 2007.  But don't buy it until you have to.  It is NOT an upgrade from the previous two versions.</review>

<review id="7538">I've used Final Draft since version 5 through version 6, and although it was antiquated and clunky compared to contemporary word processing software, it was at least useable and relatively stable. HOWEVER - I recently upgraded to FD7, and it's a mess. It implemented new features in such a way as to make them impractical in daily, minute by minute by use, while simultaneously dumping several genuinely useful features from previous versions. It's already been through two patches since it was released, and it's still clunky, bug ridden, crash prone, and less usable in practice than the previous version. If you are a first time buyer, I'd recommend delaying your purchase for at least six months till they sort out the bugs (assuming that's possible), or consider buying another of the many products available, e.g. Screenwriter or Sophocles.ADDENDUM:I'd also recommend you read some of the reviews on this site with a pinch of salt - there are a couple that I would consider suspiciously glowing. There's nothing to stop someone from the manufacturer adding a review, is there...?UPDATE: 24/9/04You're going to love this... Following "problems" with the latest patch, they've withdrawn it. Now even their PATCHES don't work. I'm so appalled by this abysmal software launch that I felt compelled to share my experience, if only to share the pain. Actually, it's gone so far beyond abysmal it's become laughable. I've used FD5&6 professionally for about 4 years, but nothing on earth would persuade me to buy anything from this company in the future.</review>

<review id="7539">This year my wife and I started out with a join HSA but needed to split this into 2 separate personal HSAs during the year because of company insurance changes.  The TurboTax HSA entry screen cannot understand this and insists that the joint HSA contributions are over the single limit and adds to my taxes due.  So now I get to fill out my forms manually while TurboTax looks nice in its box next to my PC.  I will certainly never buy this product with this kind of support.When I requested technical support on how to enter this they replied back that this sounds like tax advice so I will have to pay for help.  Then to top off this insult, when I tried to enter a negative comment to the survey they sent out asking if I like their support, the web site errors out everytime I try to submit my comments.</review>

<review id="7541">Seemed like a great idea.  My husband, quite difficult to please, LOVED his birthday present - the Flip MINO.  First problem was how to attach the wrist cord (very brief instructions; it's the new thing - go find the how-to guide on the internet), but he mastered that.  The size is great, the quality of the picture - surprisingly good, and it was simple to use.  We even downloaded to e-mail and bored our friends with our test results.  Then we tried to watch it on TV, using the attached cable.  Nothing!  We had sound and a scrambled picture and their technical assistant could not help us.  And then - the lights on the back wouldn't go off, and we couldn't use the Flip.  Called another techie and was told to stick a pin in the pin hole in the bottom, which we did.  It re-set everything.  But the problem occurred every time we used the Flip:  the lights stayed on and it stopped working.  The battery kept charging when we tried that as a solution.  We gave up and sent it back (thanks to Amazon, returns are always simple).  Would like to try it again, but I'm nervous about this problem and the overall quality of the product.</review>

<review id="7542">The product failed on me only after having it for 3 months.  Corsair customer service has been slow to send me a new one.  Not worth the hassle of paying for shipping and being out of a drive for such a long time.  Go with some other manufacturer.  The rubber is unnecessary and makes it hard to connect.  I end up leaving the dongle on it so my drive has essentially doubled in size.</review>

<review id="7543">I bought one, then two more after the first one worked OK for a few days -- a mistake  The drives (all 3) continually have directory corruption issues in XP, and require dskchk, even immediately after fixing in the same session!  ... Now after several months one has failed completely.  Simpletech's website has a contact form that claims they'll get back within 24 hours... three weeks later I've yet to hear a word.  Try calling the numbers on their website?  All you'll get is a 'beep beep beeeeeeep! all circuits are busy' message, all the time.  In short, they cannot and will not be contacted, caveat emptor once again.Another company that believes the best policy is to sell unreliable junk and then hide behind their website and busy phones to avoid responsibility.  So much for quality or ethics at simpletech. BTW...

From the womb my son enjoyed having his hands on his face and he is not able to calm himself without them.  This product traps the babies arms underneath it. Whereas with a blanket, he can get his hands out if he needs them.  Also, this blanket is hard to figure out, it does not multi-function like a blanket can, and once any baby becomes aware of their hands, they don't want them trapped anymore.  I found the Halo Sleep Sacks to be a much nicer product!</review>

<review id="7545">This review is from: Quantum of Solace [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)      With their lavish budgets, handsome actors and eye candy actresses, and gorgeous onsight shooting locales at vacation spots around the world most of us fantasize about visiting, the 25 James Bond films have often been triumphs of style over substance. Never has this been more readily demonstrated than in "Quantum of Solace", the most recent spy movie in the series."Quantum of Solace" is a movie loaded with action, beautiful women, a noticeable bad guy, a pretty good Bond figure -- and no discernible plot. I sat in that theater for 105 minutes and continually waited for all the pieces to fit toghether, and they never did.The film opened with the same nonsensical action sequence of the last Daniel Craig as James Bond film -- "Casino Royale" -- with a couple men continually jumping 50-100 feet at a time from tall building without incurring so much as a sprained ankle. At the end, after a lot of shooting with automatic weapons, there was a car chase. At the end of that, Bond opened the trunk to show he had a tied up guy in the trunk. Are you following this?If not, that should be a clue to you how much sense this movie will make for the whole thing was just about the same -- a lot of disconnected action sequences built around the slimmest storyline you've ever seen. The was something called Quantum but I never figured out if it was animal, vegetable or mineral; whether it was a company or a product; and whether it was a good thing or a bad thing.Here's what you can figure out: the movie involves a bad guy and his quest to capture the market on either oil or water in a Mediterranean country. He makes a deal withe general of a junta to get rights to one of the above. This is, Bond thinks, a bad thing. This seems to be the entire premise of the film and it's not clear by the end whether this was a bad thing.There are other disturbing trends in this film, as well. As in Craig's earlier Bond film, "Casino Royale", his character is more of a thug than a spy. He kills countless people in this movie, some of whom you can't tell whether they are for or against him. There is a scene in this film -- the first scene ever in a Bond film of its type -- where someone actually dies onscreen.Such is the way "Quantum of Solace" fails to achieve the goal of every film, to suspend disbelief for a couple hours. The essence of a Bond film is a hero that can do anything, a sort of hypersexed Superman called on to wipe out the Lex Luthers of the world. In the Craig duo of movies, it's not clear whether Bond is the good guy or Luther.And this is too bad, for Daniel Craig makes a striking Bond figure. He's tall, ahtletic, with a great build and gets a lot of beautiful women. He's good with the gun, good behind the wheel of the car, and good in bed. He knocks out the bad guys a dozen at a time and has unending energy. He looks good in a suit and tuxedo and demonstrates a quantum of subtley on occasion that aids his cause.However, he cannot overcome the near complete lack of cerebral energy in his films. The scripts are poor, the storylines are marginal, at best, and the end product becomes a sequence of action scenes leading to no discernible end. To this end, this movie may as well have been the one I saw advertised in the theater, the second sequel to the brainless "Fast and Furious" series coming next summer to that theater.I recently saw a movie critic that attempted to identify his five favorite and least-favorite Bond films in one of his columns (he called them the five best and worst Bond films.) Most people that have seen them all will attest that, once Roger Moore left and th Ian Fleming novels were all captured on celluloid, the movies tended to get worse. With "Quantum of Solace", the Bond movie anthology continues that trend. This one joins "Octopussy" and "Never Say Never Again" at the bottom of the barrel of Bond films.</review>

<review id="7546">I just returned mine today after spending a week trying to get it to maintain connectivity to the other PCs and to my cable modem.  I called tech support a total of 5 times.  I upgraded the firmware, reflashed it, changed the internal network address, changed the MTU setting, and changed the broadcast setting.  This was all done while connected to my wired PC.  Nothing worked for more than a few minutes.  Tech support, being out of solutions, gave up and finally said it was defective.  I was more than happy to return it.  I don't think mine was defective.  I think the product itself is worthless.</review>

<review id="7547">Unfortunately this product never arrived to my home in Arizona.  I tracked it until it was scanned in Phoenix.  Amazon claimed that the product was returned to them because it was marked undeliverable. UPS told me, my address was correct, and that the product was lost.  Amazon refunded the cost of the product without giving me the option of shipping another similar.  It was a waste of time and phone calls to Amazon and UPS. Its is ironic that UPS still post the tracking number of the product "In Transit".   My wife ordered a similar product for Amazon.  This time, however, she choose to pay the shipping.  The product was at home, same address, in less than five days.</review>

<review id="7548">Well well what da ya know. I hate to do this because I love to give props when they're due and give 5 stars to everything I ever got from amazon because most of it works great. But this device here..This $#!T should be taken off amazon. I kid you not, no more than 5 weeks of owning this crap I encountered problems. You never know what kind of stunt its going to pull. It's a blessing if the computer recognizes it and you're actually able to transfer a file but more often, it makes the sound that windows makes when it recognizes that a new device has been inserted and within the same second it is "pulled out" and makes that sound that says a device has been removed. Other times it says USB device not recognized. This also happened to my sandisk 8gb but my 2gb sandisk worked fine for a year! I'm thinking its the bigger flash drives in general. HEAR MY CRY!

<review id="7549">The biggest drawback of this camcorder is that it uses Sony 3" Rewritable DVD+RW. And it has only 30 minutes storage capacity. So after every 30 minutes you need to change the DVR. Now who will use a camcorder with just 30 minutes of one time recording capacity? These are the days of hard drive based camcorders where most competitors use a 40/60 GB hard drive which gives around 1000+ minutes of video. Unfortunately Sony decided to use them in their high end camcorders.</review>

I can't see how that would be less work than scooping, even if my cat had wanted to use the thing. To be fair, he walked in it once to pee because for some reason he does that with his butt facing out, but he poos looking out and couldn't even turn around in there!

<review id="7556">I will admit I am tough on Joysticks.  I picked this up about a year ago and I have just ended up trashing it because it has gotten worse and worse with keeping calibration.  I have even noticed that when setting the calibration in Windows the stick no longer does full movements all around the box and the Twist axis also will not max out to both sides.  I also HATE the throttle control on this thing.  I have had more problems trying to keep the throttle perfectly centered so I am not moving planes, Choppers, and vehicles in forward or backward direction.  If you are like me and tend to max out the different axis on you joysticks and tend to push a little harder than normal this stick will drive you nuts.</review>

<review id="7565">This machine is underpowered for all but the most basic of uses - namely web surfing.  After loading MS Office and a few other basic productivity applications on it, performance to a molasses crawl and I resigned myself to letting my six-year old take it over for Disney.com access.  That's about all it handles well and even then, only when hooked up to an external keyboard, mouse, and monitor.  The internal keyboard is much too small to effectively use for anyone with average size hands or fingers.  Video files of any decent bitrate density choke the underpowered processor such that one sees only a jumpy picture.It suffers from very poor quality control issues as well.  The networking functions (both wireless and Ethernet) stopped working within a few days of turning the unit on.  While this may have been a WindowsXP issue, I had to go through the e-recovery process to regain this functionality.  While this worked, it meant wiping the hard drive and reloading all of the software I had loaded to date as well as ensuring getting any personal files off of it prior to rebuilding the drive image.  This took a lot of time.  (Loss of network functionality is unusual unless the hardware stops communicating with the OS for some reason.  Reloading the drivers for both networking devices did not solve the issue.)If this is not enough to stop you from buying this unit, please read on.  Two months out from the date of purchase, the battery stopped holding a charge and would not recharge, even after repeated "cycling" as I was advised to do by Acer's automaton e-mail response.  If you ever have a technical support issue under warranty and must get in touch with Acer, grab yourself some soft melodic meditation music, a six-pack of your favorite tasty beverage, and a large supply of whatever substance you routinely use to calm your nerves - you will need it.  One can't actually speak to a human being at Acer.  Instead, they prefer to hide their human-based technical support folks behind web  or IVRS interfaces and the only way to get past the initial step of either is to posses a valid SNID or serial number, which is found on the bottom of the computer.  For reasons unknown, neither the website nor the IVRS system would accept ANY number off the bottom of my system.  When this occurs, the website sends one through an endless loop of "That does not appear to be a valid serial number, please check the serial number on your computer and try again. If the serial is valid and you are still unable to register, please Contact Us."  The "Contact Us" link sends you to a web-based e-mail submission page which took 24 hours to get a feckless response which just referred me back to the IVRS phone number (1-800-816-2237) which I encourage the dear reader to try for his or herself for general amusement.  Once the IVRS system rejects your valid serial number of SNID, you either gets referred to another automated system which requires you to PAY for technical support, or it just hangs up on you, period.I spent about two hours retrying my calls and pressing various buttons and finally defeated the labyrinthine IVRS system, only to be shunted to Acer SALES.  When I finally did get in touch with a live human being, I was transferred twice, finally landing in "level 2" technical support, and in the hands of a somewhat friendly human being.  And then I got cut off.  My phone service is landline-based, Verizon FiOS provided and is quite reliable, so I can only hope Acer continues to pay their phone bill by the time you need their help, and in all likelihood you will, at least with this unit.Undaunted, I started over, and one hour later, I again made it back to "level 2" and this time gave my phone number up front to the SALES person (no, this was not a tech support person even though that's who the system led me to believe I'd be directed to) and finally began to solve the problem.  Acer does not trust you.  In order to get a replacement battery I either had to (1) provide a credit card to them to enable them to send a replacement battery to me and then quickly send the defective battery back to them lest I be charged for the cost of a battery I already bought OR (2) send the defective battery to them first and then wait for them to send me a replacement.  Neither seemed to be a good option for me after having wasted so much of my time to solve a problem of Acer's creation.  I decided to return the product from whence it came.  Let me save you some time and frustration.  I strongly urge you not to purchase this product!</review>

<review id="7566">My Home & Biz 2008 takes 5-10 minutes to load on an idle quad-core Vista system (same for XP virtual machine) - process and splash screen doesn't even show up on Task Manager for 1-2 minutes after clicking on the iconImport took 9 minutes to unfreeze after going 100% on all 4 bars. TurboTax freezes for 20 seconds when trying to select "File" menu. If you can get past all that, the speed for everything else is fine.Note for those in Colorado that are trying to claim the CO Alternative Fuel Vehicle Tax Credit (which includes Hybrids) - the state module is totally mangled but you can manually input the credit on 104CR. Unfortunately for me, TurboTax won't let me specifically select the "Limited" version of the 2008 Toyota Highlander Hybrid (which has a different credit amount), so there's no way to get it to print right without doing a manual override all the way back to your federal forms.I've used TurboTax for probably 15 years, but this may be the last year of that streak, as the quality keeps going downhill, the pricing becomes increasingly predatory, and the overall experience manages to suck more every year.

<review id="7572">Can't have a viable triangle among two handsome men and a homely woman.  Doesn't work.  Nor does it make sense for the Joker to call Rachel Dawes "beautiful" when, in fact, Maggie Gyllenhaal is anything but!  These two disjoints nearly ruined the movie for me--why?  Because every time Maggie/Rachel came on the screen, my eyes said, "Ouch!" and my mind said, "not 'beautiful.'" I realize that such a reaction is limited and limiting; however, remember that this is movie and moviegoers consciously or sub-consciously expect traditional Hollywood esthetics.  As I said, you can not have two of the handsomest men in Hollywood vying for the love of one of the homeliest women in Hollywood without jarring the audience right out of the flow of the movie.  And I was jarred!   Heath Ledger was fine, not great, in my view.  The real talent in the film is Christian Bale--in any film he acts in, to be exact.  Bale, is without question, one of the world's finest.  Caine, Oldman, Eckhart, Ledger: all fine supporting actors, but Bale takes the prize.

<review id="7583">Breaking Dawn is the final book in Bella's point of view, and I must say it didn't live up to it's expectations. Edwards relationship with Bella was not as strong in the previous novels.  I have to admit the wedding scene was great, well written. However after that it seems like their relationship just became about sex and was just kissing.  In a way I was expecting this because what made the book series so great was the idea that he was madly in love with her but was faced with the challenge of wanting to kill her. Yet by her becoming a vampire, the thrill of that is gone.  So, i don't like how their relationship lacked the spark it once had.Breaking Dawn was full of many ideas and thoughts that simply weren't followed up on, for example Bella at one point decides she wants to stay human for a while and go to college, problems arise and it's not once mentioned again.  There are other examples like this in the text.  Stephenie Meyer could have excluded a lot of irrelevant details, that simply took away from the book and made it drag.Mary sues killed the story.  The book felt like I was reading a mediocre fan fiction. One that if I were reading off another site, I would've stopped reading. The whole pregnant situation is very common, she could have used that mary sue and make it her own, but she didn't.  The whole "battle" at the end was completely pointless.  I don't get the point of setting up everything for nothing.  I think Stephenie Meyer probably just wanted to add more characters for future novels, but I think that was a stupid thing to do.  It made the ending weak.As for Reneesme, I thought she was okay, if I were witting the book, I wouldn't have made Bella pregnant.  Reneesme basically caused all the conflicts from the old book to disappear.  It was an easy way out for Stepehie Meyer to keep from having to solve everything.  For that reason, I didn't like her, or her silly name.Would I ever recommend this book, no!  It was a waste of my time. I love the Twilight series but this was a horrible ending to a good series.</review>

Be sure to carefully read the instructions thoroughly before installing.  It will save you time.  If you have trouble connecting at first, be sure to review the ip address settings on the access point.  My only glitch was not putting in the correct default gateway on the access point.  Once I corrected that, I was connected.  If you already are using a router, go with the access point.</review>

<review id="7591">The 3 versions of this movie are not even released yet and people are reviewing it?  God, some of you are really stupid.  This isn't a place to review the movie itself, this is supposed to be reviews of the actual DVD or Blu-ray product.People want to know how well the audio and video quality are when they buy the Blu-ray/DVD...we all know how great the movie itself is.  Amazon should really lock reviews for products till after they release or else you get morons like all these people putting up reviews that have nothing to do with the actual product for sale.</review>

<review id="7592">I usually just use the the online version but after reading this thread it made me realize what a rip-off the $34.95 for State filings is.  I'll give TaxACT a try this year.  Thanks Folks.</review>

<review id="7593">I watched this movie online, and I couldn't even sit through half an hour of it. It's just as horrible as the book: all the characters are just as two-dimensional, even going as far to look like and talk like they're zombies from what I could see of the film, certain aspects of the storyline are hardly realistic (the amount of time that passes for Bella and Edward to fall in love, how Bella becomes the most popular girl in school within the course of one day, etc.), and well, basically, it was just a waste of time to watch as much as the book was a waste of time to read. I couldn't even read halfway through the darned thing. The characters (especially Bella) make me just as sick, and how they're able to speed up time and defy the laws of physics makes me just want to slap the author even more for coming up with the concept of this book and for having it made into a piece of garbage they manage to call a "movie." I didn't like it, not one bit. If you did, good for you. Don't take offense just because I absolutely abhorred the book and hated the movie just as much. You like what you like, I like what I like, and this was... not my cup of tea.</review>

<review id="7594">I thought this gate would be perfect for us.  Unfortunately, I was completely wrong.  The cup mounts (so that it could be screwed into the wall) were not included.  It can't be used in a doorway that has moulding along the bottom.  It is extremely difficult to install correctly, and equally difficult to open and close when it is correctly installed.  I certainly can't open it one handed, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone with kids of varying ages.  It might be fine if you have a dog, as long as it isn't a big heavy dog that likes to jump up.  It might also work if you need it in a low traffic location.  However, for us, it was a complete bust!  Thumbs down!</review>

<review id="7596">A cool little gadget, but far from replacing a good video camera. It's zoom range is very small and therefore only shots close to your subject are worthwhile. Surprisingly good in natural indoor lighting. A fun "toy" for teens who want to get fun shots of their friends. I would not recommend this camera for family archiving use. Get a really good camera to shoot those baby and kid videos.</review>

<review id="7597">I own a lot of USB drives of various sizes.  I started a while ago using them to run portable applications on other machines.  So I transferred everything off my 512M drive onto this one and was instantly disappointed.In a word, it is slow.  Painfully slow.  It took applications approximately 5 times longer to launch and close.  I did some benchmarking on it and it appears the write speed is the issue - which is a factor for portable apps.Other than the speed, it functioned as advertised - but if speed is an issue for you, you might look elsewhere.  I sent it back for a SanDisk Cruzer and was more than happy with that unit.</review>

<review id="7598">I never watched this show on TV. When I saw that Seasons 1 and 2 are available on DVD I bought them because I loved the original show. I wasn't disappointed until the end of Season 2. I loved the plot twists throughout the show but when I saw the Season 2 Finale I could do nothing but being totally disappointed. Baltar the "bad and crazy guy" becomes president. Roslins is a teacher again and doesn't seem to care about politics anymore. The huge time jump and stuff. I don't kmow how someone can find this entertaining. I for one found it irritating and not compelling storytelling. Who am I to say something like this? I WAS a fan of the show. I hope they bring Season 3 out on single DVDs with four episodes per disk with a reasonable price. Then I can decide if the show gets better again but I won't waste my money on a Complete Season DVD box set of a probably bad show.</review>

<review id="7599">Every time I use this flashdrive it is like aliens are testing my intelligence. You try to push it in the port, the connector slides in. You try again. And again.

Finally, it connects.Dont buy this. It sucks.</review>

<review id="7600">This is my first ipod brand mp3 player, we have had creative zen, microsoft zen, disney mix stix and some others in the house.  But I went for a nano for mine!  The rest of the family went non ipod versions of mp3 players.  I made a mistake!  I can use the ipod really well with my computer and with external speakers but to listen to it with earbuds is a total waste.  The headbud jack is a total waste if you push it all the way in you only get sound from one earbud and if you pull it out a little you can get sound from both but if you move it boes back to one ear lony.  Hoe on earth does ipod expect you to move around let alone excercise if you are always having to jiggle the speaker connection to make it work right.  Don't be a fool like I was and expect great quality from ipod, go for a microsoft zune or a creative zen before you get fooled by nano.Apple replaced my nano with a new one and it is a little better, the sound quality is better, now you hear really good in one ear bud and pretty good in the other ear bud.  I bought some skull candy full metal jacket 11mm earbuds and they help alot.  Now the sound is even closer to the same, it is anoying ot have to  spend extra on something that should work right in the first place.  I still have the problem if you move the plug at all the sound totally cuts in and out, the plug should be able to plug in all he way ans work!  Really If I did it over again I would go with a Zone or a Zen.</review>

<review id="7602">I deeply regret Microsoft Office Professional 2007 UPGRADEupgrade. The new ribbon means that I have to completely relearn commands that I have used effortlessly for years. Some users find the ribbon to be intuitive; to me it is cluttered and obscure. It has become a game in my office, when we are searching the first time for a command, to see whose guess will lead us to the hidden treasure. Unfortunately, in our intensely busy, deadline-driven office, we don't have time for this.Especially disappointing is the lame Help, which I have finally abandoned. I've had to resort to Google-searches for the commands I need.The only way I have been able to get any work done in Word or Excel is through the prior version's keystroke commands, which are still built in. But you have to know the entire series of keystrokes.I feel betrayed by Microsoft. Such a sudden and dramatic change with so little support for users of prior versions has slowed my work to a crawl. You would probably like Office 2007 if you are new to Office, if you tend to use just the basics or if you really like exploring new software. If you have invested a lot in using prior versions and just want to get your work done, be prepared to lose a lot of time. Either way, I strongly recommend downloading a trial version before buying it.</review>

<review id="7604">I have never seen a computer accessory or piece of computer equipment as poor as this one in my 22 years of working with computers.  The connection points for the power and USB are so unstable that merely brushing against one of the wires will foul up your connection and cause failure of the drive.  And installing it crashed my XP system.  And even after I managed to get it working (sometimes) it still prevented my system from booting.  I had to remove the USB connector in order to boot.  And the software was so buggy it over a three day period was unable to complete a single mirror back up.  I set it to RAID 1 but it never worked property.  And after many software stalls - lock ups - it would report it had more and more files to back up as time went on.  After two weeks of trying to get this software to automatically do backups as it should it would on most mornings report a failure the night before.  I never did get the software working right.  As I said before, the connection points are so delicate that this is definately NOT a good product to rely on for your backups.  I down loaded new drivers and the latest versions of software and NEVER did I get this piece of c**p to work properly.  I returned it and will never purchase another western digital My Book product.  Funny thing: I ordered a 500 Gig SATA WD hard drive at the same time and it works flawlessly.  I think WD just needs to work out the bugs on this USB mirror drive and software.  But even if they do I'm not going to try one ever again.  I invested enough of my time in this already.  I'm looking to some different back up hardware and software.  Maybe a network back up drive would be better.I was going to give it 0 stars, but 1 star is the lowest rating possible.  FYI, The computer I tried to connect it to is a HP Pavilion desktop system running 3.06 Hz with 3 gigs of RAM, XP service pack 3.  There were no other conflicts, issues or problems with this system at the time this WD MY Book mirror was tested.  I'm still waiting for my credit for the returned drive.  Hope this helps.</review>

<review id="7607">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      Wow... the first one was at least good to read the first time, but this just sucked. I'm the kind of girl who hated Romeo and Juliet. I hated the way they committed suicide over each other, and how Juliet picked Romeo over actually having a life even though being with Romeo meant suicide. Therefore, it's not to hard to figure out that I wasn't all too fond of this.I actually don't know who I pity more: me, for reading this book when Chinese water torture might have been preferable, the editor for having to fix it from whatever level of absolute hopelessness it was in to the level of suckiness that it became, or Bella whose love left her (a sign to get over them to anyone reading this- don't wallow over some idiot) and was adament about their inexistent future together in the first place. Hm. Real tuffie. I don't know if me or the editor had it worse. What about Bella? Who cares, she was an idiot. And if love makes people fools, then it's not all its cracked up to be and I'm fine being single.</review>

<review id="7609">I bought this because of all the great reviews, but was very disappointed.  First of all, it is sort of akward to use.  I knew that it was not a battery operated device, however, it requires the use of both hands.  One hand to insert the object into your nostril and the other to swivel the bottom.  Not only is it quite strange to use; it wasn't as effective at trimming as it should have been.  I had to go over areas several times and even still didn't feel as "neat"  as twenty dollars should have bought me.  It did not pull, but that's because it barely cut anything.  I am sorely disappointed with this product.  On the plus side, the shipping was fast...UPDATE 07/14/07  The company has contacted me in reference to my poor review.  My review does not reflect the customer service of this company; the service they provide would receive five stars. My review is for the product itself. The trimmer was not for me, however, as you can see from the other reviews, some were completely satisfied. They have advised me that they would return my product for a full refund, and if I wanted to upgrade to another model, they would do that at no extra cost.  My review will stand, however,as I believe, reviews are strictly set up to inform consumers on the experience of one individual and his/her outtake on that product, not the service of the company that sells the product.</review>

<review id="7613">Linksys WRT610N Simultaneous Dual-N Band Wireless Router I replaced a Linksys WRT54G router with this model.  It never worked correctly from day 1 (After 60+ days, I replaced it with a D-Link DIR-655 and all of the problems I experienced went away).Throughout the day, for no reason, the Linksys 610 simply dropped the wireless connection three or four times every day.  I wasn't changing location so it wasn't attempting to move from the 2.4 to 5 GHz, the 2.4 simply disconnected.  In some cases, it would automatically reconnect after a minute ot two,  in other cases I had to power down and then powr back up both the router and the cable modem to re-establish a connection.The connection speed would vary from 130 Mbps to 1 Mbps and back with no other users on the network, no movement of my notebook connection, and with no large file transfers in progrss.I have read that the 610 had a heat problem.  To make sure that this wasn't the cause, I tipped the 610 up at a 45 degree angle to make sure that there would be sufficient airflow.  It didn't work any better.I had a Linksys wireless print server that worked flawlessly on the 'G' wireless modem for 2+ years.  When I attempted to transfer it to the 610, it would connect when initially installed, but once onplugged and moved back to its permanent location, it would never re-connect.  When I called Linksys about it, because the printserver was not new, they wanted me to pay for support.  Instead I bought an HP wireless print server and experienced exactly the same problem, indicating the problem was in the 610, not either of the print servers. (As an aside, this morning I re-installed the HP prnt server to the D-Link in less than 15 minutes and it works flawlessly).LELA is another bone of contention.  It has been touted as a home network management tool.  The only function I found was the ability to select a wireless networks from a list of ones available.  There was no management of anything.  This may explain why Cisco acquired the company that created Network Magic.The Linksys 610N is NOT a quality product, it isn't even a stable product.</review>

<review id="7614">Been buying Turbotax Deluxe for many years now.  Was very disappointed this year when I couldn't easily find and use the necessary forms to declare uncompensated employee expense. This was the first time this had happened.  A popup box came up urging me to upgrade to the $90+ professional upgrade.  What a rip!

<review id="7619">If you have never used MS Office before then ignore this review, because you are unlikely to be bothered by the issues raised here.As an advanced Excel user for nearly twenty years, I have to say that Microsoft has rolled out the software equivalent of new Coke.Many professionals learned spreadsheets back in the 1980s when Lotus 123 enabled tremendous advances for ordinary business users. One of the great strengths of Microsoft Excel, when it became ready for Prime Time, was its ease of use for legacy 123 users. At that time, 123 was THE spreadsheet program for business and Excel was a newcomer trying to take market share.The latest version of Office is like a punch in the stomach for experienced users who have invested thousands of hours over many years mastering Excel, Word, PowerPoint and other software staples. I have not noticed the problem with Word so much... how hard can one make typing, after all? But new Excel is a productivity disaster.Does the Microsoft brain trust honestly believe that users hunt around with their mouse to execute spreadsheet commands? The "ribbon" seems well-suited for that purpose and little else. Any keystroke commands or muscle memory that you may have developed over the past two decades... forget about them. Need to put together a last-minute graph? Order out because you are not going to finish before dinner. Whoever made the decision to NOT provide legacy keystroke support should have their head examined.I sincerely hope we can look forward to a service pack release to bring back "Office Classic." Office 2007 may include features that, some day, I will come to appreciate. But unless and until I find a need for them, I am downgrading.</review>

<review id="7620">I bought this almost a month ago. It is very cheap and doesn't do everything it says it does. The juicer is a joke. And it takes way longer then 10 seconds to make anything smooth. Making simple smoothies with frozen fruit over heated it twice and it stopped working. It also drips oil out the bottom and stained my counter top. I was expecting this really strong motor after watching the infomercial and was so dissappointed that it was so weak. It is also very overpriced. If it was a lot less expensive to buy it might be worth the few things it does but no way for that price. I got a Vitamixer on ebay for this price and it is so powerful and works beautifully for anything I want. It is a snap to clean also. So I have returned my &quot;Tragic Bullet&quot; and want to warn others before you buy it. I just found out last weekend my sister in law bought one and and soon as she saw mine in my kitchen she just started laughing and we began to tell all of our &quot;Tragic&quot; stories. This is definetly false advertising.</review>

<review id="7622">I can take a lot of pain, I have plucked my leg hairs and my mustache with a tweezer but this "braun epilator" was a whole new level of pain. As painful as waxing, but more direct pain. I do not think this amount of pain is worth being able to supposedley not shave in "1 week". It doesnt even get that close and it misses hairs. And i cannot imagine putting this on my bikini line. The rollers go so fast, that i felt like a was going to give myself an electric shock. Girls, this is not worth the money. As much as i wanted this to work, it is too painful for live humans, for cadavers it might work ok.Dont waste your money like i did. No epilators work well, unless you can deal with extreme levels of physical pain.</review>

I took both dogs out to our farm - the one on Frontline was covered in ticks by nightfall. The one on Advantix had none.I consider that a pretty good test of the products.I realize they are totally different formulas. Advantix contains a heavy dose of permethrin, Frontline Plus does not. Some dogs have apparently had problems with permethrin, so do your own research or ask your vet.</review>

<review id="7624">**SPOILERS**After being an big fan of the first three books, I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on this one.  The first few chapters were fine...I expected the wedding, the honeymoon, etc.  I even liked the way Meyer delicately wrote about Bella and Edward's first official night together.  As soon as the baby entered the picture, however, my eyes were continually rolling and I felt I had been cheated (and the NAME...that was REALLY ridiculous...).  Of course this is Meyer's world, and as the creator she gets to decide what befalls her characters, but at what price?  To me, the characters no longer fit within the roles she had created for them.  I almost quit reading it several times but thought it would eventually all make sense.  It never quite did for me.  The ending is what everyone would think is a perfect little package, but it's lacking in so many ways.  It's almost like Meyer had a deadline and had to bring it all to a conclusion, so she thought of the quickest way to give each character what they wanted.  It was a letdown, and it's too bad readers will remember this as the finale for an otherwise gripping series.  I can't imagine what readers would have said had J.K. Rowling done the same with the 7th Harry Potter.  Luckily she knew her characters well enough by then to give us a really satisfying ending.</review>

<review id="7625">I returned the Saitek P3000 Wireless Gamepad because the batteries not working, and random glitches due to the wireless connection during game play. It was consistently a problem.I decided, to keep with Saitek, but to buy this controller, so i could keep my profiles, and i wouldn't have to send a weekend programming it.Right out of the box, i discovered the shift button did not work. So now i have to send this one back for a return.Another weird thing is, when i loaded my profiles with this controller, they were blank. When i open the file, the data is still there. Instead of reprogramming it, i have decided to get the Logitech. I use their game-pads for my XBOX and have never had a problem. I am convinced the Saitek just makes mediocre sub standard products. Its a name i will stay away from in the future.Conclusion:I just bought the , Logitech Wingman Wireless Rumble Pad its by far a better gamepad. Its 2.4GHZ, so it has distance. The software to program custom scripts is miles ahead of the Saitek SST software. When you load the profile, it automatically loads the game which it corresponds with.Please, if your looking for a game pad, get the Logitech. Save your self the 3 weeks on pain I had to go through.</review>

<review id="7626">I'm surprised at the overwhelming positive response to this machine. My love affair with it has lasted exactly three batches and four days.If you are just happy to make ice cream, it may be your nirvana. But the slop that came out of mine was not fit to serve to guests. Upon putting it into the freezer to thicken it up, it gained ice crystals and a texture of broken glass. I ended up buying to serve to my company. Fortunately I tried the thing out ahead of time.Here is why I recommend you not buy this machine:1) The bowl has to be pre-frozen, and may not totally freeze in an older freezer. I even tried mine outside (I live in Prince George) in -24C conditions overnight and the bowl still slopped a bit.2) Even with a frozen bowl, the product that comes out is soft and unsatisfactory.3) When you put the ice cream into the freezer to harden it, the manufacturer recommends that you let it stand 15 minutes to soften so you don't serve ice crystals. Ever done that with expensive store-bought?I have and like several other Cuisinart products. This is not one of them, and I will be buying myself a compressor unit next payday. I suggest you do the same. If you really want this one, mine is available. I won't give it to friends or family.</review>

<review id="7628">the software that comes with this router is so bloated that setting up a network becomes frustrating. anything you want to connect to the wireless network must have the software loaded, which is fine for computers, but is impossible for printers or game consols. The security software prevents even your own laptops from connecting when fully enabled, even though you have the password. so you have to disable it to connect to the internet thereby rendering it useless. Even though the form factor looks good, the functionality is horrible. The linksys wrt54g, which is the older version, is a much more functional wireless router.</review>

<review id="7629">All the fans that are leaving reviews of this that are positive should be ashamed of themselves.  This supposed 2nd season release has come out before the end of the 2nd season!  This is not the whole thing and the fact that more people aren't compaining is incredibly sheepish and sad.  If the box says season 2.0 then it should be the whole season or at least tell us it's not with something like this:WARNING!  THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST HALF OF SEASON 2!  DO NOT BUY THIS EXPECTING THE WHOLE THING!  Shame on the distributors of this!  And shame on the people not compaining about this.  Don't be a sheep!  (insert annoying bleating sounds here)  I have examined the picture Amazon has posted and there is nothing that says it is a partial collection.  Are they going to break the whole thing up when the 2nd season actually is complete?  Or are they gonna sell this DVD plus the whole season in a separate set with a higher price?  I have never seen a single season of any tv series broken up into multiple boxes (especially poignant when you consider that BSG seasons aren't even 22 episodes long like most shows on network tv).  Whenever a distributor uses a cheap trick like this to get more money out of the fans everyone should complain.  This is BS.  And the BS don't stand for "BattleStar".</review>

<review id="7631">This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) (DVD)      Original "Transformers" fans were generally about 8 years old or younger during their earlier Hasbro days of being cartoons and toys.  This film had a lot of good visual effects (actually way too much to a point of overkill redundancy).  However, I would have enjoyed this movie more if it had more of the Paul Verhoven effect (like Starship Troopers and Robocop I and II).  You would think that there would be a lot more blood, guts, and gory death with all that street destruction, but it seemed like nobody really got killed or even hurt with all that debris flying around.  But, I guess they kinda wanted to make this a movie for children to see.And if that's the case, then why did they have to throw in that "masturbation" reference?  That scene alone with that controversial dialogue was just enough to kill this films appeal of wanting to own it and share it with the kids in my extended family.  Plus, with them throwing in some comedy (and dumb comedy at that) that just made this movie uncomfortable to watch.  This movie should have been made for kids and should have left of the masturbation reference.  Or, it should have been made Rated R with a lot more blood and gore to please a more mature bloodthirsty audience.  Well, I'm glad I watched it once, but I wouldn't care to watch it again.</review>

<review id="7632">This destroyed all my white underpants.  Everything came out orange. A few times it even went through my pants, which I had to toss.  I don't see at all how this is effective. It doesn't control hunger at all, so what's the point unless you like public humiliation??  Just cut down on your fat intake and you'll feel better anyway.  It's like a punishment to take this.</review>

<review id="7633">Got this last week, plugged in and used it last night, and then started to trasfer my files to it.  After finishing transferring all my data to the device, it died... Tried troubleshoot for three hours, tried it on two of my computers, both could not detect the hard drive, and off course, no way for me to get my data back... I would never ever by Seagate's product anymore. Painful experience...</review>

<review id="7634">It's very cool that this flash drive is affordable and holds 16 gigs.  I disregarded someone's review here that it is slow, and wish I didn't.  It is really slow...

<review id="7635">** spoiler alert ** I'm a newbie when it comes to Stephenie Meyer and the Twilight saga. I love, love, LOVED Twilight and had my heart broken in New Moon and then teased to the point of exhaustion with Eclipse. I was expecting Breaking Dawn to be the climax...the ending to the exquisite foreplay that was the other three books. HOWEVER, that did not happen for me. I am still wondering what went wrong. To say that I was left wanting more is an understatement.  The whole book felt rushed and not quite as thorough as its predecessors.  To me, it felt like SM was trying to cram in as much as she could for her swan song and maybe that's what she wanted.  Maybe SM was tired of the whole Twilight thing and was ready to break away from the story of Bella, Edward, and Jacob.  Maybe SM thought this would be an easy break for the fans if she "threw them to the dogs".  Them being either the fans or the characters the fans grew to love.I could ramble on this all day, but I have to work.  Let's just say the Twilight saga, for me, is a trilogy and ends with Eclipse.</review>

<review id="7636">This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)      I was very excited to watch this movie as I have loved a few of Ben Stiller's movies in the past such as Dodgeball, Zoolander etc. etc.  I also love Robert Downey's performance in Iron man earlier this year and thought Jack Black was great in Holiday, and Saving Silverman.  I even liked Tom Cruise's star turn as an evil media type in Magnolia.  Based on the above paragraph you would think that I would love Tropic Thunder?!?  I did not!  Not even close.  I shut it off after the director got blown up by the land mine.  That was it!  That was all I could take.  This movie was just too violent and gory and disgusting.  It was NOT intelligent satire.  It was just gross!!  Especially after seeing some recent news clips of the fighting in the Middle East I just couldn't find anything funny about how Mr. Stiller was depicting violence and gore.It is a shame because the premise was great and Stiller is usually very adept at creating somewhat silly and benign satire.  AND the first few minutes with the fake trailers were HYSTERICAL!  That WAS satire.  Then it just got gross.  I can't even recall how many times I had to cover my eyes because what was on the screen was just gross!! And when I wasn't covering my eyes I wasn't laughing at the jokes either.  (they weren't funny) It is like Stiller and crew used up all their creative juices and monthly humor allotment on the fake trailers in the beginning.Horrible movie!  Save your time and money and go take a walk and watch the sunset.</review>

<review id="7638">I was not happy with this keyboard for one reason...reflective paint on the keys. If the keyboard was used in a completely dark room, it would work great, but the light from my monitor reflects off of the keys, resulting in a very low contrast between the keys and the illuminated letters on the keys. The tops of the keys should have been painted with a matte, non-reflective black, so that the blue light shining through the letters would be more in contrast. In real life use, the visual ergonomics are very poor.I think this keyboard is a great concept, but it was poorly realized. The light from a monitor reflects off of the keys, creating almost a silver look which is very low contrast to the illumination color.I also purchased a small Zippy Illuminated keyboard which is much easier to read. However, the Zippy is only slightly larger than a laptop keyboard and I wanted a full size, so I ordered the Eclipse.</review>

<review id="7639">I bought this item a little over a week ago, and when I first opened it, I couldn't even get the darn thing to work, they say to wash it under hot water or in alcohol before use, so I did exactly that. And the trimmer would not rotate back and forth... It took letting it DRY first for the trimmer to begin working. When it did work, it only got the big hairs but noticed alot of other hairs where still left in my nose... Overall not too great of a product.... I thought it would be better considering all the reviews</review>

<review id="7640">This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)      Maybe I had too much high hopes for this movie . . .I mean Ben Stiller was the lead so I should have expected it would be as bad as it was (though Ben Stiller was good in Night at the Museum and as the voice of the Lion in Madagascar . . His crudeness though in non-children's movies can just get a bit too . .. distasteful). The first couple of minutes with the faux previews were delightful and hilarious ..then it got worse . .and worse . .(though I heard it got decent at the end and that Tom Cruise was funny . .maybe it's a shame I fell asleep before the end . .Yes your heard me . .I fell asleep . .I just got so bored and confused and disgusted that I couldn't take it anymore)The blood and guts in the movie (despite it being a "war" movie) was distasteful and crude to the max . . . It didn't add to the movie at all. It kind of made me feel uncomfortable . . .The acting was shameful. It was so bad it was almost hilarious in itself. It seems that Ben Stiller is stuck as the same character in ALL of his movies . . . Where's the originality? Jack Black was also . .well . .laughable (NOT in a good way), and Robert Downey, jr. was eh ..  .not bad, but not good either . . .and his role was sort of offensive . .well offensive to people who took the movie too seriously but that's besides the point. Any comedy can be seen as offensive if you look at it the right (or rather, wrong) way. The supporting actors must have been not that good either because I can't remember who any of them are .. . .except Tom Cruise . . .It's say to say this, but there wasn't any redeeming value to this movie unless you're into the "stupid" comedy genre . . . Now don't get me wrong . .I like some "stupid" comedies myself (I liked "Anchor Man", "Dodgeball", "Old School", and "The Big Lebowski" to name a few), but there's something about Tropic Thunder that just made it bad . .really bad .. . .Though if you really feel the need to see this movie (who knows? You could like it. Everybody's tastes are different if you ask me), then I suggest you rent it rather than buy it. Don't waste the however much it is . . .</review>

<review id="7641">I purchased this after reading positive reviews.  Even on the highest settings, indoor video and pictures are not very good.  Outside shots are fine, but we take lots of video and pictures inside too.  I tried turning on all the lights and opening all the windows but the video is still grainy.  Several reviewers said that this is a good camera for the money, but mine is going back.  Keep looking unless all of your shots are going to be outdoors.</review>

<review id="7642">My Flip arrived with a corrupted file system, so I could not install the PC software and I could not upload the one video that the Flip was able to record.  I tried installing and uploading on 4 different computers: 1 Mac laptop, 2 Windows XP Pro desktops, and 1 Windows XP Pro laptop; all failed with "I/O error" or "Bad CRC" error messages, or just hung during the software installation.  After each try I had to reboot the computer, and remove the batteries in the Flip to get it restart.  I am returning the Flip as defective.</review>

<review id="7643">I should first say that I have 2 VERY food aggressive cats.  All of my cabinets are child proofed to keep the cats out.  I picked this up in desperation one weekend before I had to go out of town and I had no one to care for my cats.  The first feeder I bought did not work at all and I ended up taking it back to the store.  Luckily, the second (and last one they had at the store) worked fine.  Programming was not that hard but I'm kind of a techie anyways.  I could see how some people would have difficulty with it.  As other reviewers have mentioned it's not very sturdy.  I was able to solve the problem of the lid coming off with a lot of duct tape. My cats were also able to figure out how to get a piece at a time by sticking their paws up into the feeder.  I didn't really mind that so much since it kept them occupied when I wasn't there.  I just made their feeding portions smaller. The biggest problem I had was the amount of insects the feeder attracted.  Since nothing in the feeder is really sealed off it becomes an ant and roach feeder too.  After a period of time the residual tape adhesive on the lid made it very dirty.  6 months after I got it I tried to clean it and it stopped working.  I don't really see how this product would work except for the smallest and most docile pets.</review>

<review id="7645">I'm a self-employed consultant and also earn income from a mutual fund. For at least the last 10 years Turbotax Premier has done all my taxes just fine. Cost, about $40.

<review id="7646">I sent this back 3 times because tt wouldn't work for more than a few h ours - - I also ordered the batteries they sold with the product - -and they were not the correct ones (there is no return with the batteries).

<review id="7647">I bought this as a gift for my daughter. We played videos through our TV and were very impressed with the quality. The problems started when I tried to connect it our home computer, a Dell desktop running Windows XP. It wouls attached to a USB port and the camera's screen would light up saying connected but the computer would not recognize it. I tried several ports and got the same result. I e-mailed support, got a response and followed the directions but still nothing. I tried connecting the camera to my office laptop, a Gateway also running Windows XP. It recognized it, although it caused an external hard drive to crash. While I had it connected I downloaded the upgraded recommended by tech support hoping that would do the trick on our desktop. Still nothing. Needless to say I am very frustrated and my daughter is very disappointed. It looks like I need to return it to the place of purchase. But the problem remians, what about my daughter? The appeal of the Flip was its simplicity. To me simple is NOT spending over 2 1/2 hours trynig to get it to work properly and failing.Depending on your computer, be prepared to feel the same way.</review>

<review id="7652">This is by far the worst example of "American" engineering I have ever seen. Where has all the quality gone? Does anyone believe in quality anymore? Why bother buying from USA based companies when they produce utter crud.Specific complaints:1. No switch; sparks fly out the backside of this piece of junk each time I plug the cord in. You'd think it was the 4th of July.2. Have to reboot it twice per day.3. It frequently looses all the configuration information, so you have to reenter all the settings.I got so sick of this unit, I put my fist through it, then chucked it out the damn window.

<review id="7653">With all of the coverage about poor Windows Vista performance on conventional (aka more powerful) hardware, it is surprising the anyone would think that an ultra-portable form-factor could run it successfully.Other ultra-portables from ASUS and others are shipping with far leaner and more stable operating systems like Windows XP or Linux.I love this form factor, but we're a long way from ever seeing Vista run well on any of the units in this class.</review>

<review id="7656">I purchased this little gem last week.  And it is a fine piece of technology. Fairly easy to use once you've familiarized yourself with the controls.  Large fingers be aware the controls are small.  Now the sad part. When trying to install the camera to my Windows Vista home premium machine it will not install.  Keeps looking for software on the vendor disk.  I assume it's looking for TWAIN drivers which are not present.  Spent about an hour of frustration.  Turned to my HP laptop with XP.  Same thing no luck.  One e-mail later to Canon returned the commment I need to talk to Windows folks.  Canon support site is also not helpful.  No mention of trouble shooting installation problems.  They just don't wanna hear about them.  I will try to talk to some tech folks at Canon on Monday and if they can't resolve the issue then the Camera goes back.  Shame Shame Shame.</review>

<review id="7657">Overall I am very disappointed by this USB drive. The first one stopped working within the first 30 days of usage and its replacement - fast and without problems from amazon - stopped working 5 months later. After pluging the USB drive into the computer its light flashes for a few seconds up to several minutes and then after that time it suddenly stops and is not visible on the Computer. This happened on several PCs/Macs and on USB 1.1 and 2.0 ports while cheaper no-name brand flash drives work perfectly. I only can encourage people with a defect drive to use the 10 year limited warranty by corsair: http://www.corsairmemory.com/warranty/default.aspx or by phone: 1-888-222-4346</review>

<review id="7658">This product is fine in all but one thing.  Unfortunately, this one thing is  totally fundamental and thus negates any other advantages the product might otherwise have.The problem is this: it doesn't play tracks in the correct album order - it plays them in ALPHABETICAL order.  I've never seen another MP3 player with this problem...even the 128mb freebie that came with a stationery order.I rang SanDisk asking when a firmware update to fix this basic problem would be available - I may as well have tried to divine it from tea leaves.  They had no idea, and what's more, the product's been on the market for OVER A YEAR, and they still haven't fixed it.  Useless.They also told me to simply change the ID3 tags - which doesn't actually work, as the player then plays them in some kind of random order.  Plus, if I've got 500+ tracks going onto this thing, do I really want to faff about changing each and every track tag? No I do not.It was then suggested I create playlists on Windows Media Player (great customer support this is - .wpl isn't recognised and you have to create .m3u files in Winamp - I had to tell THEM that!).  But why should I have to do that, when all other MP3 players simply play tracks straight away in the right order automatically?! Here's a suggestion from me SanDisk - get the basic functions right before releasing a product!Avoid this player if you prefer listening to music the way artists intended it rather than the way an inferior electronic device decides you should.</review>

<review id="7659">This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) (DVD)      I thought this would keep my interest but I fell asleep after 30 minutes of this absurd movie. How about a CUBE FROM OUTER SPACE --- WOW! Anyway, I went back again and finally finished it. The robotic effects are amazing, the battle scenes are too long. The military is amazing, the dialogue is cute, all in all too long.</review>

<review id="7660">This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)      I didn't see this in a theater and I am glad I didn't waste the money.  Lots of potty humor and way way too much foul language just for the sake of foul language.  It could have been made with much less bad language and been funnier.  I gave the movie away to a friend (hope we are still friends after he watches it).  Please say there won't be a sequel.</review>

<review id="7661">If you use Macs like I do, then you're probably used to plug-and-play and just take that for granted.  The Flip Video is not one of those devices that you can just plug it into the Mac and expect it to run properly.  At least not the first time.Out of the box, the Flip video works just fine in taking videos.  Just install the included batteries, turn the camera on, click on the red button, and you're recording.  Simple!  I thought it was great.  The simplicity is, after all, what we're looking for.  There wasn't any manual besides a quick start guide.  It didn't bother me because, with Macs, we never really use manuals.The problems came in when I tried to get the video out of the camera.  I plugged it into the USB port of my 1.6GHz PowerBook.  Nothing.  The camera does not even mount.  I tried the other port, and same results.  The ports work, I'm sure of it (I use them for external drives, cameras, etc).  I looked up Flip's site, and the clue was that it has to be a powered port. No problem, I switched to a desktop connected to a powered USB hub.  A message pops up saying that there's not enough power to the camera.  Hmm.  Tried another powered hub.  This time with my PowerBook again.  Now the camera mounts, but the videos are unviewable.  I tried installing the software that came with the camera, but a message claims that the software is not recognizable.Getting annoyed and have already spent more time on this than I really wanted.  The other reason I was annoyed was that a friend was waiting to find out how I like the camera so that she can order one for her husband's birthday.  I also don't really like to give up so easily, so I tried one more time.  So I ejected the camera, unplugged everything, plugged it back in, and surprise!  NOW it works.  I have no idea what's wrong with the camera or the software that makes this so.  I've read some of the other reviews saying something about the camera not working until you plug it into a different computer.  All of a sudden, the camera works for all the computers.  I don't believe in voodoo, and there has to be a rational explanation for this.Now that it's working (sort of), I can't really decide whether or not I should return it.  It doesn't strike me as a very reliable device.  I still like the idea of having a super portable video camera that will fit in a pocket or purse.  And I might hang on to this for a couple weeks.  But I am far from impressed by this device.  It's not so much the device itself and its video-taking capability but it's user-friendliness in the back end, when you have to process the videos with the computer.  I also tried calling the phone number on the camera's website, but a recording comes on that states the number is no longer in service.  I think that's really pretty incompetent of the company to publish a number that no longer works.I'm not recommending this to everyone.  If you like problem-solving and think you can get lucky, then go ahead.  For those who just want a plug-and-play type of gadget, stay away.  It could be better, but unfortunately it's not.</review>

<review id="7662">This router worked OK when used with a wired network, but beware if you go wireless!  First I tried it with a Wii.  Worked ok for like 2 days, then the internet connection on the PC the router was connected to kept going up and down and then finally stopped all together.  It is a DSL connection.  So I reset the whole router, reinstalled all software and it worked ok for another 2 days connected to the Wii and then the same thing happened.  So I eventually stopped using the Wii wirelessly.  Wwll, 2 months later I bought a new laptop.  Connected to the router fine for a while.  Now the same thing is happening with that as with the Wii and I know the DSL modem is fine after testing that.  DO NOT BUY!</review>

<review id="7663">My N10J was delivered to me yesterday via Fedex. I opened it up with much relish and cleared all of the packaging away. It is very nice looking. It looks like a quality product. After I unboxed and cleared away all of the packaging, I fired it up. I pulled out the quick start directions. Plugged it in and booted it up and......nothing. So I tried and tried again. I then started looking for tech support. The 1888number for Asus premier support was busy or it just did nothing. I never could get through to the toll free support. So I went online, to Asus online, and was able to chat from my PC to a live person. The tech guy listened and asked me if I tried "F9".  I said, I never even heard if there was an "F9". How would I know to hit "F9". So we did the "F9" thing and reformatted the entire harddrive from the hidden partition. After 25 minutes everything would be fine, he said. Not so. System kept looping and could not boot Vista. According to the online chat tech guy from Asus, I have hardware failure.  Arggghhhh.  My relish turned to sauerkraut in short time.</review>

<review id="7664">The main problem is the lack of "user friendly" instructions. This is an extremly complicated device. I just can't find where it walks you through the process.

<review id="7666">Have had difficulty flying (MS FltSim 2004) with this joystick:1. Throttle doesn't work reliably2. With stick at dead center, plane goes into steep dive with strong right turn tendency. No way to calibrate so that dead center is straight level flight.3. With stick at dead center, no twist, plane on runway wants to steer hard right. As with 2. above, no way to calibrate so that no twist is straight ahead.3. Requires too much pressure to move stick off dead center; disconcerting.As a result, I feel forced to replace this joystick with one without the above problems.</review>

<review id="7667">I've always been a Turbo Tax user and before that used tax accountants software--so I'm no novice.  I complete about 6 returns a year. After seeing all the negative opinions about Turbo Tax changing its product I made the stupid decision to buy Tax Cut this year.  What a disappointment!  I found it very confusing and hard to use if you don't want to go through the whole question/help process. The information didn't flow to other schedules or forms like it should--I would think this would cause mistakes for people who don't know what to look for.  I was so frustrated, I turned around and ordered Turbo Tax to complete the balance of returns I've promised to do.  I'll never use Tax Cut again.</review>

<review id="7668">This router has been trouble from day 1. I've had problems with the router dropping [wireless] connections from the get-go. The router also loses IP addresses at an alarming rate. Virtually non-functional. Support from NETGEAR is non-existent.</review>

<review id="7669">I really liked the super talent thumb drive until it totally stopped working. I have had my brother who is a computer genius try and salvage it for me but all efforts were wasted. Buy at your own risk!</review>

<review id="7670">Sadly, this drive lasted less than 12 hours.  It formatted properly and worked right initially, but by the next morning, my laptop couldn't find it.  After testing it on another machine, I confirmed what I suspected -- dead drive.The LaCie tech support process isn't very friendly either -- it amounts to a back-and-forth e-mail exchange between user and tech, hosted on their website.  It took three days just to get past the "is your drive plugged in?" level of questions.  Some level of phone support would have helped.I've returned the drive and will probably try a replacment and hope for better luck.  I've had success with LaCie drives in the past, and this thing sure does look slick (even better than the pic)!  Hopefully, I'll be back and able to report something more favorable in a few months.</review>

<review id="7671">At first, I was skeptical because of all the bad reviews for the latest revision (v5) of this router.  I bought it anyways because I had bought two other earlier routers, with the difference being the revisions.  After a 2 weeks of trying to get this router to work I've given up on it.  It continually disconnected the internet connection, and at last try the router wouldn't stable enough to ping it for a minute.  I've updated to the latest firmware update and that hasn't help a bit.  I've already sent in the UPC for the rebate so I can't even return this piece of junk.   It's going out with the trash on next pick up.  Interestingly, when I plugged in the router I bought with the older version, it worked, and has worked ever since with no issues.  Do not buy this version!  Buy the more expensive "GL" version instead which I hear is the same as the old version.  It'll be worth the the time you save, and headaches you'll avoid.*** UPDATE 6/29/2007 ***Okay I couldn't throw this thing away, months after then initial review, I thought I'd give it another try.  I recently sent this in to Linksys and they sent me the V6 model (instead of the V5 that I originally had).  I was fed up with the Linksys firmware so I decided to give the DD-WRT firmware (micro build) a chance.  Installation was a bit difficult, but following the instructions carefully led to a successful firmware update.  DD-WRT is impressive.  However, this hardware is still pretty horrible.  Once a week my router would lock up and I would have to power cycle it.  Avoid this one like the plague, get the WRT45GL version Linksys-Cisco WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router  (Compatible with Linux) instead.  I have never had any problems with that version, and it works great with DD-WRT.  Good luck!</review>

<review id="7675">I am one of those people who enjoyed the first three books, but knew her writing needed work.I had no idea it needed as much work as BD proves it does. This is the worst book I have ever read in my life (though I've only read through p. 303 so far and read descriptions and quotes of what happens after that).This book is full of deus ex machinas, telling instead of showing what happened to someone, the characters fall in and out of their established characterization, and to top it all of Bella sacrifices nothing and gets everything.At the end of Eclipse, Bella chooses immortality with Edward over a life with children and college and career with Jacob. She even has a vision of having two children with Jacob, but she loves Edward more.This book nullifies that decision's consequences by having Bella get pregnant and giving birth to a half-human/half-vampire girl named Renesmee Carlie (a combination of Rennee, Esme, Charlie, and Carlise). Jacob imprints on Renesmee and gives her the nickname "Nessie." He imprints on an infant. This is one of the deus ex machinas SMeyer uses to prevent her characters from actually getting through life with real conflict and maturation. Jacob hates the idea of imprinting because it takes away choice. But he imprints on the thing and will now probably never stop phasing into a werewolf and therefore never age and never die. She has turned Jacob, who represented life and all its changes, including death, into another immortal. Bella also doesn't have any problems as a newborn vampire because she's the biggest Mary Sue, self-insert character to ever be published. She also saves the day with her power.This book reads like SMeyer scoured fanfiction.net for plot points and cut and pasted it all together. SMeyer obviously wrote this with the thought in her teeny, tiny brain that she's writing what the fans want.Lesson number one in writing, SMeyer, as Joss Whedon once said "Give your fans what they need, not what [you think] they want."If this is the real Breaking Dawn, I'd like to know what the parody you wrote your publisher is like, because the only reason to read BD is to make fun of it. SMeyer is a coward and a cop-out. I prefer authors who aren't afraid to put their characters through actual pain and give them real consequences to their decisions.The title of the last chapter is "The Happily Ever After."I think SMeyer forgot she was writing about vampires and werewolves instead of Prince Charming and fairies. To quote Jacob, "I wanted to somehow pour bleach inside my head and let it fry my brain."DON'T BUY IT.</review>

<review id="7676">This review is from: The Princess Bride (Special Edition) (DVD)      Let me say this first and foremost, my boyfriend told me about this movie while walking to the library one day. At first, I told him I didn't want to see it, but he insisted that I should give it a try and afterwards tell him how I felt about it. So, I said O.K. and borrowed it for the weekend. And there I was, sitting in the living room with my boyfriend, watching the Princess Bride. Robin Wright plays the serious, deadpan Princess Buttercup, Cary Elwes plays the poor, lame, non-acting farmer/pirate character, Westley, Chris Sarandon plays the very cruel and very pathetic prince Humperdink, and Billy Crystal plays the lovable Miracle Max. Now, I was very Surprised to see the late Andre the Giant in this film, he did a very good job being that this was his 1st movie debut. He made me laugh and that really helped. I'll miss him, we all will. Still, I couldn't shake the fact that something was bugging me through the film, It was Cary's character Westley. Not only did his acting sucked (like it always did.) But there was an issue about his legs. They looked like they've been traded for woman's legs! (the black, tight pants gave it away, sorry.) Of course he had so much love for Buttercup, but that couldn't even make it up due to Westley's corny lines. Cary, go in the kitchen and make yourself a Ham Sandwich, ya killing me! Anyway, Robin Wright's Buttercup character was another thing that was bugging me. Why would a princess be so serious and deadpan all the time? She only smiled when she wanted to. Really, is that the princess way of life? NO WAY! They made a cute couple for the time being. Going on, Chris Sarandon's character, Humperdink. His performance needed some work. He was so snobbish, so arrogant, so high-and-mighty and very cruel that he litterally made me sick. I had to mumble under my breath that he was alot better in the "CHILD'S PLAY" movie. Yes, he bugged me also. Everybody else's performances were okay. Swordfights, honor, true love, bravery and triumph were the only morals that I recognised. There's nothing wrong with that. Andre's character was funny and lovable, Billy Crystal's character was funny as much as he wanted to be. He needed more scenes though. Oh, and the music in the background, I loved it. It sounds so beautiful, it should be on the soundtrack. My boyfriend didn't like the movie  either. This movie is DEFINITLY for the kids. I'm just grateful that I watched it only once. And what's with that punk villian with the 6 fingers? Doesn't he realize that he could get away making Humperdink angry because of the 6 finger income? (I hope I said it right.) Anyway, I leave this movie towards the likes of my brother and sister. They'll probably like it. Bye, I've said enough.</review>

<review id="7677">This review is from: Gone with the Wind (VHS Tape)      Why all the fuss about this movie?  I agree with Helen Davidson using Rhett Butler's quote, &quot;Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.&quot;  So much is said about this movie and it just doesn't live up to it.  With  the exception of the panoramic scene of the wounded soldiers, the rest is  trite.  The acting is terrible, with the exceptions of Hattie McDaniel and  some comic relief from Butterfly McQueen.  The plot was ludicrous, the  characters uninteresting and unappealing, and basically the whole film  mediocre at best.  I remember seeing it when I was a child (in re-release,  I'm not that old) and thinking it was great but after sitting down recently  and watching again, I was amazed that this holds such esteem in the film  world.  Either I;m missing something or it's a question of the Emperors New  Clothes.</review>

<review id="7678">Wall E starts out fine but in the second half a message that is dangerous and just wrong comes across.  The message is that fat people are lazy and stupid.  Every human character in this movie is grossly obese and lazy.  They stay in recliner chairs that hover and move around so they don't have to.  They are so lazy, they don't even eat their food, they drink it instead.  Then they are portrayed as dumber than dirt when their captain tells them they can grow pizza plants on earth.  They are so excited to grow pizza plants, they wobble and waddle out of their chairs to follow the captain.  It is sickening and untrue.  If Pixar or Disney showed a race of people the way they show fat people the movie would be banned.</review>

<review id="7679">If there is one thing that the creators of this DVD got right, it is that positive thinking can change lives. I have seen it do wonders in my life and the lives of my friends. Other than that, it contains only the incoherent rantings of philosophers who claim to be scientists. Normally I would respect the kind of outrageous claims made in this film as matters of opinion and personal belief, but when a person claiming to be a quantum physicist starts telling people that they can cure themselves of diseases like cancer by the power of thought alone, I get a little peeved (to say the least. Plese watch this film for entertainment purposes only, if you must watch it at all. Not only is it very silly, it can be dangerous if taken seriously.</review>

<review id="7680">This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)      I bought the BBC Blu Ray version of this after watching the whole series on Discovery HD channel and I fell in love with what i saw. The series is absolutely amazing. I gave it 1 star for this versions packaging for reasons below.This BBC Blu Ray release version is HORRIBLE!1st and foremost 1 of the discs in this box set was an HD DVD format disc... not even Blu Ray! They actually gave me one disc in the wrong format. 2nd the video quality of this encoding is a mixture of great to horrible. Some shots are crystal clear and beautiful. Followed by a cut of a series of shots that are very grainy and snowy looking (its not my equipment, it was the encoding of these discs) The Discovery HD channel shows I saw did not have these grainy snowy shots in the same portion. I know, because I compared the ondemand version of it directly against the Blu Ray version and I couldn't believe how poorly encoded this versions transfer was.3rd (this one is subjective only) if you are buying this cause you liked the discovery channels narration, please realize the narrator on this original BBC version is different and to me talks in such a mellow monochromatic way it almost lulls you to sleep! I knew the narrator was going to be different before I bought this. What I did not know is I would not like the narrators performance.</review>

<review id="7681">Like the other reviewer, I was disappointed that the headset did not have a usb connection. The headset also cannot be altered for fit. My headphones broke at the cetner very quickly and now I have a difficult time using them. Stay away from these headsets.</review>

<review id="7682">The Good:When I first heard about this board I was incredibly excited.  I have been playing BF2 (Battlefield 2) for almost a year now and still continually find myself stumbling over the keys. So it was a godsend to be able to purchase something like this directly intended to help me be better at my game. The interchangable keysets for different games and applications is quite intriguing -- the first that I have seen.  But the price for each is kind of high but well worth it.The Bad:The board is constructed well but don't expect this to replace your home keyboard.  The "Windows Keyset" that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any run-of-the-mill keyboard but it is awkward to type with (I might be biased since I have a MSoft ergonomic split keyboard). In-game typing is difficult at best (with the gaming keysets). With most of the gaming keysets the keys on the left 1/2 of the keyboard are laid out like your home keyboard but on the right 1/2 side they are all vertical (not staggered.. like U,J and M  keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other). The keys feel a little "cheap" .. When you push them down they don't bounce back as much.The Ugly:About 2 weeks after I purchases this board (and the BF2 keyset) 9 keys went completely dead.  I tried to reinstall the software, reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of Windows XP to no avail.I contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that I have a faulty base unit. DUH!  They are "reviewing my warranty" but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day. Maybe this post is premature but I don't think I am getting a new base unit.Conclusion:The expression "Great Idea, Bad Execution" holds true here. My opinion: Don't buy this board. Ideazon has too many issues, not enough support staff and a website that doesn't do anything but look good.</review>

<review id="7683">I just purchased this teakettle -- thinking that, because it was a lovely stainless steel teakettle (like what I'm used to in England), it would work beautifully.  Not so, sad to say.  It takes twice the time of the Braun's plastic teakettle to boil and, as another reviewer pointed out, it keeps boiling and boiling and after a long period of time, it may finally shut itself off -- not a good sign.  This fact alone makes me very concerned that it could be potentially very dangerous.  It also gets very hot on the outside and is not insulated, which is another drawback.  And, at the risk of being a bit rude, here, it's made in China (cheap!); whereas the Braun is made in Germany and clearly a far superior product -- both in design and engineering!  Again, it's very lovely to look at and I'd wanted to have a brushed stainless steel teakettle to match my teapot, but that's really the only thing it's got going for it.  It's also super heavy and it hurts my wrists to lift the thing.  It's a lot more bulky and awkward than the ones we had in the UK.  I'd stick with the German-made products and avoid devices made in China.</review>

<review id="7685">I find the keyboard for this computer very intractable - not to mention too small to ever use the home keys.  But even after I "hunt and peck" type a line, I have to go back and fill in many letters.  I thought at first it was just my problem but others who have used it say the same thing.  There is an adjustment for "keypad touch" in the computer's settings but not for "keyboard touch" so I don't see a solution.  There must be something wrong with my specific computer because I have not noticed anyone else mentioning it in a review; therefore, it must not be a general design flaw.  I also notice that if I do not use it on AC power, the battery just drains almost immediately as I am e-mailing.  Had I to do it over again, I would not purchase this computer.  I got it just for e-mailing while I'm traveling but it's so time consuming because of the difficulty with the keyboard that my travel companions chose to PAY to use the computers in the lobby of the hotels rather than use mine FREE.  I don't think I will take it with me again so I'm stuck with a $300 purchase that I do not want.</review>

<review id="7686">Worked fine for two weeks. But then wanted to completely be retrained every day before it would do anything. Free knowledge-base fix for error message would not solve the problem.

<review id="7687">You have to hit the spacebar dead in the center or it will not work.  The keys are mushy and you have to be exactly on top of them for the light to show through the entire letter.  I am returning this keyboard, only it doesn't show up on the items I can return.  Emailed customer service on that.  I have a Saitek Eclipse II and that keyboard has none of the problems listed above.</review>

<review id="7688">What I thought 1 hour after taking them out of the box...Pros: The rumble feature is kind of cool.Cons: This headset completely trash.  Yes it's easy to just plug in and play but what they dont tell you is about the constant buzzing noise, the awesome scratching noises they make every 5 mins and also the microphone is worst i used yet. While on ventrillo and teamspeak instead of hearing my voice all they hear is a VERY loud screetching noise.  I highly reccommend you dont buy these and go look at other headsets.</review>

<review id="7689">Found it gives variable readings.  Brought it to the doctor's office for comparison and both systolic & diastolic readings were high compared to doctor's monitor.  Also higher than what the neighborhood Urgent Care Center came up with so had to return it as I thought of it as useless.</review>

<review id="7690">I will say that the video quality at the highest setting is very good.  I also purchased the largest additional battery that was available and i am not diappointed with that either.  I have shot over 30 hours of video so far and the quality is pretty good.  The camera is light weight and easy to hold for long periods of time with no problems, which is a huge plus.  The menu is easy to navigate to make any adjustments.  What does disapoint me is that i have had several drop detection errors occur when i was filming, even when i was not moving my hand.  I do have a professional camera mount kit for my car and when i film inside the car (mounted on the dash) at high speeds and high g forces (think of how the car leans around a turn) the camera is fine.  But once i take it outside the car even at speeds around 60mph and no turns, i get camera errors such as hard drive issues,  I happened when i wasn't even going over 30mph.  I also found that the editing software is very poor.  I went ahead and ordered the recomended software upgrade from jvc, Cyberlink power director V6.  I find that windows movie maker does a pretty good job, but it won't import the files from the camera.  overall, if you don't want to edit and want too keep it simple, buy this camera.  If you are looking for something a step better i wouldn't recomend this camera.  I personally would not buy it again.</review>

<review id="7691">We bought this coffeemaker exactly one year ago.  We are coffee lovers and have gone through lots of machines over the years.  We generally brew two pots a day.  After about 8 months of everyday use we noticed that the coffee was not at the serving temperature we enjoy.  I decalcified the machine and first cup temperatures improved but second cups and more were definitely cooler. After a another decalcification yesterday the machine stopped working entirely.  The electronics may be fried.  The good news is that this machine has a 3 year warranty.  I'll return it but would rather have a different machine.  Our experience is that the glass thermal carafe types do a better job of keeping coffee at the desirable temp for those follow-on cups. The configuration of this machine is for the most part desirable.  One flaw is that larger travel cups will not fit in under the dispensing spout.  Even the 5" tall travelers are so close to the spout that you can't see clearly when they are close to topped off. An overfill is the result.</review>

<review id="7692">The Omron HBF-500 fat scale measures your weight, body fat, skeletal muscle, BMI and resting metabolism. It can also give you a relative value for your visceral fat.  All this from a stand-on scale. The question is - is it accurate?We already own several devices to determine our body fat. We have a stand-on scale, a handheld unit as well as a traditional fat caliper. All of these other units agree completely with each other as to our fat percentage. However, this Omron HBF-500 is always MUCH higher than that "correct" value. For the actual scale part (the pounds you weigh) it is very accurate. When we compare it against other scales we have, the values are typically within two tenths of a pound. The problem is that you can get a regular weight scale for MUCH less money than this. The scale goes up to 330 pounds which will not be enough for many obese people to get a handle on their weight issues.The reason you would get this high end scale is for its extra features - the fat measurement, the muscle measurement. However, we have proven beyond any shadow of a doubt that the body fat measurement is grossly inaccurate. There is no way that all of our other fat measuring systems (by different makers) are ALL off to get the exact same value, and that meanwhile this Omron machine is the only one to peg the right value. Since we know the fat measurement is wrong, how can we trust the muscle measurement, or the visceral fat measurement? BMI is easy - that is simply a ratio of height and weight. Since you program in your height, and it tells you your weight, it can calculate your BMI. Any of us can do that :) It MUST match other readings as long as your height doesn't change ;)It is nice that it has a built in memory, but again most scales of this level have that for you. And having it remember your values so it can give you inaccurate results isn't very helpful.It really concerns me that people will accept as a given that the fat values must be accurate because the scale says them. I really recommend people pick up a $10 caliper and learn how to measure this the old fashioned way. It's quick, it's easy, and it means you can KNOW if any fancy gadget you get after that is telling you the truth.I want to say it is VERY important to track your weight and fat levels. I definitely think people should have a good quality scale in their home to use at least weekly. My issue here is with this one, and with the numbers it provides.I'll give it 2/5 because the scale part is great - but the fat numbers are just wrong. I really recommend getting a good quality scale (which will be much cheaper) and then a functional fat measuring device of your choice.</review>

<review id="7693">I am would say I'm very tech savvy having much of the latest tech and building my own Home Theater Pc. I have seen many hard drives in my time and used perhaps all of the hard drive manufacturers (From old 4 GB drives to  1 TB drives). Not one has failed until this drive. I was lured by the cost of the drive and wanted to backup my media onto this drive to clear space on other drives. But no less than 3 weeks after converting nearly 300 GB's of data on the drive, there was catastrophic failure. I lost all the media I was converting. Nearly $300 worth of itunes media and countless hours of video conversion data for my apple tv was lost because the manufacturing of this "sleek" designer hard drive. Take my review with a grain of salt being that I lost a ton of data. However, the hard drive failure has been due to mechanical error. Also, customer support has been very lack luster and now 2 weeks after sending my hard drive for replacement, I have yet to receive an email or call regarding the status. For all I know the company has reconditioned my drive and will send it out again. There has been no follow up and return procedures are sketchy at best.</review>

<review id="7698">It is just like a slow cooker and it is so small. I had been using a slow cooker to make yogurt by myself and then I thought that  I could get a yogurt maker to save my trouble. But after I got it, ----I found it is just another smaller slow cooker!! You have to go through all the same steps: warm your milk in a clean container; --- put it into the slow cooker or the so-called yogurt maker; put the yogurt seed that you bought ; --- make sure the temperature not too high to  kill the yogurt bacteria; ---watch the time to make sure you are not "overgrow " it; --- take it out. There was at least twice that I thought I needed not to watch the time--because, it is a yogurt maker and it should stop by itself, but it did not. And then my yogurt turned into something hard to describe--sticky and very sour. Now this "Yogurt maker" is not used anymore at my home.</review>

<review id="7699">I had Huggies for my daughter since she was born and I was very pleased but a friend recommended Cruiser's so I decided to try. The first difference I noticed was the gel, it was like "fluffier" so with a little liquid the gel got bulky. The second was that her skin felt wet all the time. So with this 2 issues price/quantity convenience just vanished because I had to change much more often (like 10 to 12 times a day). The worst was that after the first week of use she had a very bad diaper rash. Since we changed diapers brand and formula at the same time we didn't know for sure what was the cause, and the pediatrician told me that changes in food could cause poop and urine PH change. So I started changing diapers even more frequently and using tons of baby ointment and she got better. The next week the rash appeared again, and again i used a lot of ointment in every change but nothing happened. I changed ointment and rash was getting so bad she cryied on every bowel movement and screamed on every pee, and one day the sores even started to bled. Finally I decided it was too much and went back to huggies, she started to heal an the rash dissappeared within a week.</review>

<review id="7701">In general this product received good reviews here, but the question is -- how many people actually compared their fat monitor results to another source? When I received this product I tried it and my fat percentage was impossibly-high for someone of my build, blatantly wrong. I borrowed Omron's handheld unit from a friend and tested back-to-back and got a much more reasonable reading (although I can't say how accurate that one was either). The differences were approximately 6-8% off! The monitor is useless and I would return the scale if it weren't for the fact that I believe the scale portion to be accurate, the price wasn't bad, and it's a pain in the [...] to return stuff online. I'm not sure how reliable any monitor like this can be so I'm just going to have a professional test performed if I'm interested.</review>

<review id="7702">If you have a smart or highly persistent dog that will chew bits off almost any toy except a Kong, skip this.  I would have, but it was a gift. The first time I left this toy in the crate with my smart, 6 month old blue heeler mix puppy, I came home to find she had somehow managed to unscrew it and eaten all the treats. The second time she played with it all over the house, and the noise drove me crazy. Bang, boom, bang. She kept rolling it down the stairs, off a ledge, and knocking things over when it rolled behind them. But she was thoroughly entertained, so I let it be. The third time she played with it while I was cooking. A few minutes later, I looked down to see she had unscrewed it again, and was chewing on the various pieces happily. I didn't stop her since the brochure said it was virtually indestructible material. When I picked it up a bit later, her chewing had apparently ruined the threading so I could no longer screw the lid back on. Went right into the trash.  Entertaining, but not durable at all.</review>

<review id="7710">I did an advance purchase of the slingcatcher. Its the worst Sling Product I've ever seen. First of all, I have very high speed internet connections. When you boot the system up the first time, it took nearly 4 hours for it to upload "software updates." Next, when I downloaded the sling projector, it worked all of about 2 minutes and then it went blank. The screen has been blank everysince. The media manager file fails to see files on the external hardrive. Dont ask me why. Lastly, I tried calling tech support, and the tech was surprised that the slingcatcher had already been sent out for purchase.

I even took it to India with me. The battery life is also great. However, I was never fully happy with it. For some reason the computer would freeze on me and I would have to shut it off and restart. At one point they had a system upgrade that I installed. That system upgrade completely corrupted the hard drive of the machine and I had to send it back to Everex. When they sent it back to me the freeze ups stopped but the main issue that I had with it didnt. The wi-fi on this was very poor. Although I did take it on trips with me - it became pretty pointless because I couldn't connect to wi-fi anywhere I went. At home I didn't use it because even when I was 10 feet away from my wireless antennae it wouldn't connect. This sat and collected dust. After reading many reviews and tips from people who were also having the same issue as me - I decided to just switch from Linux to Windows. After that - the wi-fi worked great! I could use it 2 floors away from my wi-fi antennae and it would connect with no problems. However, one day the machine just stopped working. The machine turns on but the screen does not. I have no idea what the problem is but this has now become a useless item - once again. In the one year that I've owned this item I was never fully happy with it. I would recommend to either wait this version out or find another small laptop.</review>

<review id="7714">There are two things I really like about this product.  The software works great and it is nice to be able to track your progress.  I love the resetting itself at midnight.There are many things I do not like about it.  It seems to "stall".  It will not record steps and then suddenly takes a jump and adds lots at one time.  You cannot track your excercise on a stationary bicycle no matter where you place it.  If you are on your riding lawnmower, it adds steps like crazy.The size is too bulky.  It is very awkward to wear.  I wish I had not given my other pedometers away.  They were much less expensive and I liked them better.</review>

<review id="7716">Australian Customs confiscated this as a prohibited product, deemed as animal cruelty.   I was surprised as someone in the ratings reviews said it was only a mild buzz that it gave out on the person's skin, as he had tested it. So if you live in Australia, don't buy this product. My daughter in USA had recommended it as working on one of her 2 dogs, but when she mailed it to me in Australia, of course, it never reached me, (so much for "Pet Safe".) You would be far better off putting your money on the gee-gees....(horses)!</review>

<review id="7717">This is likely the best netbook on the market but for one thing -- the keyboard is coated with silver nano.  Google "silver nano danger" to find out for yourself what this is.  There are two main problems with it; first it is ultra small particles of silver that appears to damage organic cells (which is what makes it anti mircrobial), there are no studies to show that this stuff is safe, indeed there are many scientists who believe it may be dangerous to humans -- a lawsuit has even been filed by a coalition of consumer groups to force to EPA to ban it.  The second is that widespread use of anti microbial stuff like this is highly irresponsible; much like the over prescribing of antibiotics, worse even because there is no reason to have this stuff on the keyboard at all, these strong anti microbials lead to more resistant strains of super-bacteria -- the only microcrobes left on your keyboard could be these super-bugs, free to multiply without competing with harmless bacteria.</review>

<review id="7718">If I had to write up a list of the worst movies I have ever seen this would be on it right next to Eragon, Battlefield Earth, and A.I. I can't even begin to describe how embarrassingly bad the screen play is for Transformers. It is hard enough to make a serious movie about alien robots that transform into cars without having a screen play that is so illogical that it trashes any hope of a film with any redeeming qualities. Why, why, why would the Decepticons attack a random military base in Qatar to retrieve classified computer files from the U.S. government? And when that fails, instead of going right to the source, they decide to try and get the files from the computers in Air Force One, another random and pointless target just to create attention. Not to mention the fact that no one thought it odd that a cheap boom box was on board the plane under someone's chair.Can someone please try and explain how the entire sub-plot with the computer hackers and Australian lady had any purpose in the movie at all. She and her hacker friends ended up being of no help and they did nothing to affect the outcome of the movie. Yet, we are stuck watching scenes of them trying to decipher the Decepticon codes and being detained by the FBI and then being taken to the Hoover Dam. Once the Dam scenes are over, you never see them again. A completely pointless plot line that was just left hanging.I could go on and on with ridiculous and illogical scenes from rooms with computers and ancient radio transmitters being set up to send morse code to the Air Force to plain outrageous scenes with John Turturro as the head of a secret FBI division acting so over the top that I continue to seethe with hatred for him and his character. A secret government agency that no one knows about? Lame. How many times has this plot device been used? Never this poorly, I can guarantee that. All of our modern technology was developed from frozen Megatron? Yeah, right. The government had Megatron for 80 years and they have absolutely no protection or defense ready? Not believable.I think the scene that finally broke the camels back for me was when one of the Autobots "lubricated" on John Turturro's character. What a pathetic and childish attempt to draw some laughs out of an audience.All of the battle scenes, every - single - one, was done with jerky cameras, blurred vision, blinding lights, collapsing buildings, and hidden views and so I never could figure out who was fighting who. I can understand if this movie is, at its core, a movie about fighting robots. But then why make every single fighting scene so hard to see and follow that you can't tell what is going on? The scene cutting is so frantic and jumbled you would need to watch it in slow motion to figure out who was fighting who, with what, and who was winning. There was not even one single, clear shot of the fighting to make it satisfying in any way.At the end of the movie we are left with two very poor plot twists that the audience is supposed to accept. First, that both the entire US military and the Autobots would leave it up to a teenage boy to carry the All Spark cube to the top of a building and deliver it to a black hawk helicopter. Second, that after trying to keep the All Spark from Megatron the entire movie, Sam decides to shove it into the Decepticon leader instead of giving it to Optimus Prime. I did not accept these actions at all. How could anyone? They just do not make any sense.I also do not accept that this film could be considered even passably good by those die hard fans who just wanted to see CGI Transformers in action. The sheer amount of pointless (and extremely illogical) plot lines and inane characters killed this movie and not even giant, alien robots could save it.Kevin's Review: D-</review>

<review id="7720">This is the first time, that I'm disapointed about an HBO series. I liked The Sopranos, Deadwood and Band Of Brothers. All "grownup" shows and kind of revolutionary for the TV audience. I had high expectations in True Blood, but the result was a boring soap opera, disguised in a vampire story and filled with a lot of sex scenes, wich are mostly unnecessary. The show has interesting moments, but you've seen most of it on your ordinary TV-Show at every other channel.Too bad...</review>

<review id="7721">Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)      I was upgrading from 2003 Office.  I didn't really need an upgrade, but I got a deal I couldn't pass up.  I wish I did, however.  It took a full hour to install this software on a new mac laptop.  Installing a whole new operating system doesn't take that long.  If that weren't bad enough, the first time I opened it I had to have MSoft update it before I could proceed to even look at it.  It crashed during the first install, so it took another 45 minutes of aggravation getting the update installed.  After all was said and done, I don't think its any faster or easier to use.  I see no real improvement over the 2003 version whatsoever.  MSoft is really hurting these days.  What a load of garbage they put out.</review>

<review id="7722">I don't care how much you loved Twilight, how loyal you are to Meyer, or how you want to delude yourself into thinking this is a good book out of devotion--don't. It's horrible, like published fan-fiction, only worse. Oh, and let me explain near the end of this why you shouldn't listen to the 5 star reviews. First, the writing is just terrible. So much of it is generically vague and non-descript, and we're constantly told what happens instead of shown. The characters act like dolls, and much of it seems to be trite dialogue. There is a lot of back and forth where it seems like they're only going through the motions. Beyond this though, the first person narration is truly horrible. At times, it feels as if Bella isn't narrating at all, or she's not even there. Some cutoffs from her dialogue to her straight thoughts don't read well, and sound as if she's still speaking out loud when she isn't. There's no reflectiveness in her character, or really much at all. There's also a terrible abuse of unnecessary adverbs and bad dialogue tagging. "He shuddered convulsingly" (pg 67) will never be a good sentence, and it's not the only one like it. It's redundant in and of itself, and indicative of lazy writing description. This is not to say that adverbs can't exist--they're essential, sometimes. But Meyer's complete abuse of them to convey all her points cheapens the writing. Further, she far abuses such tags as "I lied" and "he questioned" to get her point across about the speech. This is bad, because it's overdone, and if "I lied" is all we get from Bella in particular points to convey the scene (and it is, for there is too much dialogue without much actually happening) then it's not conveying what's going on well. If you were reading quickly, you could have missed it. The plot, itself, reads like it was stolen from a fangirls wet dream. Meyer is even inconsistent with her own world, essentially breaking her own rules to make the plot work. Good authors don't do that. Sorry Meyer. Maybe you should consider taking actual creative writing workshops instead of bragging that you haven't. It's nothing personal, but you can do better than this crap.Spoilers below this point. I say you really have to read some to understand just how -bad- this book is. Bella is a horrible role module character, and the messages in this book are not things that should be promoted. To start with, Bella begins the book by complaining about being rich and getting what she wants. Considering it's in her personality to complain about everything, as it seems, this is somewhat problematic, as it shows a pretty selfish character. She gets a Mercedes Guardian, not even released in America yet, and bitches about it. Not a great way to begin to connect to the audience for one. Am I supposed to feel sorry for her that she has this awesome car? Because that's a big NO. Do I see her as humble for not wanting to be seen with it? No, not particularly. Because she just "doesn't want to draw attention to herself." Because she's getting married at 18, and she's just embarrassed, I guess. But really, not a good way to begin. The narrator doesn't get better. The wedding was shallow. It's amazing how little of it is actually described, other than being "amazing," which honestly doesn't explain much. Bella essentially loses all doubts she may have had as soon as she gets up there on the alter and kisses Edward, effectively cheapening any depth there could have been to any underlying issues. Bella doesn't come to terms with anything--she just suddenly knows that this is all well and good. At this point it might be worth it to note that there's not even a description of what Bella looks like in her wedding dress, other than "stunning." Come on, Meyer. You even said you were exited to write the wedding. Where's the wedding? Oh, and Bella also hardly seems to worry at all about leaving her friends and family behind forever. Nope, just a little tinge, but really, she can sex Edward, so it's okay.About the sex. They have conversations about it without outright saying so, and even do the deed once before saying the word outright. This can be fine, but the way it was done was such a mess, it seemed more like Meyer was afraid of sex or the mention of the word. It's somewhat obvious that sex is what they're talking about, but even so, it's still annoying. Also, The sex scene itself was ridiculous and boring. Never mind my personal belief that by Meyer's rules, it shouldn't even be possible (vampires have no blood or any real liquid, except for venom. I wonder how exactly Edward would "get it up" without blood and with a lack of hormones, unless he just has that kind of control over his penis. Although, since Edward is described as basically being as hard as a statue all the time, even if he's flaccid you might get something to work there [though it shouldn't]. And I still have my doubts about how truly amazing their sex should be, as I really wouldn't want cold hard marble in my vagina, no matter what guy I was with. But I digress. Of course, their sex is wonderful, because everything has to be perfect, and Bella is completely a cannon Mary-Sue). Further about the sex. Edward apparently just can't control himself after the sex, and eats the pillows, tearing them to shreds. The second time he attacks the headboard. Judge that one for yourself. I find it ridiculous. Even -further- about the sex. Bella and Edward are, first of all, both virgins until this point. Bella, after realizing just how absolutely amazing it is, decides that she wants it all the time, seriously begging for it like a sick sex-obsessed puppy. Nice going Meyer. That's totally what every 18 year old should act like. Even worse though, is that after her first orgasm, Bella decides that being human really isn't so bad. Because the sex is awesome, and she enjoys being hormonal. Also, great message. The only reason to stay human is to have absolutely amazing sex (that seriously shouldn't be. You know, cold things numb you). She only wants to continue living as human and got to college because of Sex. Sex is apparently everything. Really, you know how to drive home your point Meyer. Never mind the bad representations of females you had in your other books, this takes the cake. The only reason to live is SEX. Without sex with a hot boyfriend/husband you are DOOMED. If you do not have sex, you should beg for it (Bella does) and when you have a sex dream, you should wake up crying about it because it's not real, which will make your boyfriend/husband sex you. Because sex is all you need to make you happy. And this book is for teens? I'm not saying teens couldn't handle the themes--considering the amount of slash fanfiction, most of which written by teens, I really think this is tame and altogether something not hard to deal with. The themes are nothing a 10 year old couldn't take, in all honesty, provided they were mature. But the way it's written is just bad.  Meyer, once again, proves that Bella is not at all as mature as she pretends she is. But of course, she might explain away the sexual obsession with the fact that Bella is pregnant with a mutant half-vampire baby that's, by the way, killing her. "What?" you might think. "But Vampires are STERILE!" Well, by Meyer's laws, they should be. Consult the Twilight Lexicon, and you will find a personal correspondence with Meyer that says pretty explicitly that vampires can't get pregnant. Their bodies freeze exactly as they are and basically die. You know what that means? No sperm. Or, dead sperm, if any. Oh, and since their bodies -can't- change--you get it. So, not only is this impossible, which means Meyer is breaking her own rules (needless to say, bad form), but the baby as a plot device is rather lame. Not only is it a slap in the face, since the idea behind picking Edward was that she'd give that all up, but it's also a bitch-slap to Rosalie and completely points to Meyer making Bella incredibly perfect. This whole thing cheapens the romance, cuts out the struggle, and makes any drama worthless. She's undercutting her own plot. BAD form. Also, Meyer's basically doing her best to give Bella everything when she doesn't deserve it, which again, points to Bella being a cannon Mary-Sue. Oh, but possibly worse is the fact that Bella comes to the sudden revelation that babies are good, despite never having wanted one before and there being no actual reason for this. She "suddenly realized" that she really wanted this baby. So, message? Teens should marry early and reproduce as fast as possible--it's always a good thing. Don't wait to pop out those babies. Oh, and you'll love it, no matter what (completely screwing with character and actual reasoning there, it's not developed at all). Oh, and by the way. Vampire baby? Grows three times as fast. So despite it only having been a little more than two weeks, there's a baby bump. No, I'm not kidding. It's straight from fanfiction, and there's no reasoning for it. How does Bella realize she's pregnant? Well, at first it might be hard to tell, because Meyer's lack of actual useful description of anything has Bella looking at a generic blue box when half-thought things flash through her brain, meanwhile the readers not getting much of anything. So Bella picks up the blue box, announces that her period is 5 days late, and -then- she tells you it's a box of tampons. And she really couldn't have said "the tampon box?" It's like a lame attempt to try to be dramatic. The entire book is like that. I told you, it's a fangirls wet dream. Edward and Bella sex it up a few times, mutant baby that grows so fast that it'll be full grown (18, physically) in 6 and a half years before turning into a vampire to stay 18 forever, and Jacob imprints on the baby. Oh, wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. We also get a few chapters from Jacob's point of view. No, the writing itself isn't much better, although it's nice to get away from our lame heroine. it is through here that we Jacob learns of Bella being "sick" and he decides that must mean they're turning her into a vampire. So, he basically shoves himself into the Cullen's family while alienating himself from his own pack to deal with it. Upon realizing Bella is pregnant, neither he, nor Edward really approve of the kids existence and want to abort it to save Bella's life. What does Edward do though? He tells Jacob that Bella will have his kids with him. Okay, wait, what? They're married, and Edward's making a deal like that? Without even consulting his wife? And Jacob agrees? What? Do I even have to point out how wrong that is? Oh, and in case you didn't believe me when I told you there's way too much dialogue. Flip through Jacob's chapters. You see all the italics? How it takes up more than half the page? Those are thoughts between the pack members talking to each other. Yes, it really is all like that. All the conversations run too long too, practically hitting you over the head with the point.Oh, and Jacob spends a lot of time wanting to kill Edward. Maybe that's one reason people don't like the themes in this book for children. Honestly, it's written in such a way it doesn't matter. He might as well be contemplating squishing a tic. Oh, and here's a little side-rant. Bella's supposed to have "a private mind" right? But then Meyer also says how easy she is to read. In Jacob's chapter, he says so too. Being easy to read is not compatible with having a private mind. But Logic has long run away. Oh, and Jacob's descriptions aren't better either. Emmet is "the big one," and Rosalie is "the showy one." Yup. That says a lot. And apparently, Jacob can't kill vampire girls, because they're girls (175). That's not Sexist in any way. (These books are all extremely sexist. Not a single strong female character exists. Remember Bella? Not strong). I'm going to skip over a lot, because one review can't possibly do justice to all the problems this book has. Skipping over how Bella's basically dying until she drinks some blood and all that such crap, Bella gives birth and is basically dying. That's right, she's dying in childbirth when she gets turned. Raped fanfiction, and generally done before. Bella gets not one vampire superpower, but 2. She gets a LOVE SHIELD that she can use to protect people she loves (which should essentially just be her and Edward and Jacob, because she shows no real love to anyone. No, actually, not even Edward, because it seems more like lust there than love). A Love Shield? Really? Wow, that's not pathetic either. Breaking out the "protected by love" thing is pretty sad, and it's another way to drain the drama. Not that we'd be allowed to believe that anything bad could ever actually happen anyway, because Meyer needed to go for the overkill happy ending that never makes sense if you want to go for even the most minor shot of realism. She also gets the ability to read memories. I don't know how Meyer can justify either of those, since from what we can see of Bella's personality and gifts, neither of these makes sense. And of course, never mind that most vamps would only get one power. Bella is so UBER special, she gets two.She's also so uber special, that she turns complete vamp faster than anyone, because her heart was stronger than even Emmett's. That makes no sense, except that Meyer fails at symbolism. It also functions as yet another way to make Bella so extra special that no one can deny it and she lives a perfect life, despite the fact that it makes no sense. Oh, and all that talk about being a crazed newborn vamp? Might as well not be there. Bella is sooooo cool, she adapts without really having to think about it. Because she's soooooooooooooooo special, she defies the reality Meyer had set in place, for no reason. Just like fanfiction. This is lame, and it undercuts the drama. It makes everything that came before it mean nothing. There's no overcoming obstacles. All the obstacles that were there for drama are conveniently taken down, or not true obstacles at all. It's cheap, and bad form. Do I have to continue to prove this book is terrible? Well, yes. I'm cutting out again though, because there's no way to fit all the issues with this book in here. (BTW, Bella protects people in the battle with the Voultri with her love shield. Hello, Sailor Moon). This one's somewhat a personal issue, but the name Renesmee (Renee and Esme) is ridiculous, and WAY too cutesy and overdone, especially considering the rest of the book. And the middle name is Carlie (Charlie and Carlisle). That's just weird. But don't worry. Jacob nicknames the baby Nessie, which is sooo much better (Lockness Monster). That one's just weird. But to ensure a happy ending for all, Jacob, failing to get Bella, imprints on little Nessie. Which is not creepy, or like a pedophile at all. But don't worry, because it's alright. She's his soulmate now, she'll grow up in 6 1/2 years, and be a complete adult that he can sex (with "chocolate brown eyes" like her mother, because that description is not overused at all. Brown is never brown, it's chocolate). So yeah, he's basically raising the kid he's going to sex up while still technically too young for him and protect the kid from it's own parents, Jacob can insert himself in the Cullen family of love, and everyone's happy. But Meyer has never had issues with older men dating little girls. Edward is, like, 100, remember? I'll leave the ranting on the overtly sexist themes to someone else--there's always someone else ready to point it out. In short, Edward is abusive (overtly controlling) and Jacob, though still my favorite since he was the only character that didn't make me want to murder someone in New Moon, is somewhat like a rapist (forcing himself on Bella).So Meyer, what was it you said about giving everyone a happy ending? Yeah, you kinda screwed that up when you got your fans both saying the whole Nessie situation was sick. People already have their twilight icon's switched to "July 28 08, the day the fandom died" (the day it was released early in Texas). Oh, and Meyer's also screwing with the idea of the Incubus to explain away Bella's pregnancy. Edward is now an incubus. Never mind that the incubus and vampire were two distinct creatures, but the incubus generally needs to have had sex at least once before so it can get the sperm to impregnate the women (either it was also a succubus, and it sexed men to get their sperm and then turned into an incubus and had sex with women, or it sexed a succubus to get the sperm the succubus had gotten). If Edward doesn't get sperm, this is a problem. She screwed with the rules, and she's completely butchering another creature that doesn't deserve it. The explanation still doesn't make sense, and it's too much explaining without enough plot. As for any positive reviews here, let me counter a few of them, and explain why they don't matter. first of all, to the people saying Meyer left loopholes to get herself out of the Nessie thing. Good authors don't need loopholes. When you reach a point, even a surprising one, there should be some reason that it clicks, and it shouldn't need to be completely re-explained. The explanations are not particularly good either. If she had established a world in which this made sense from the beginning, but simply misled everyone to believe it was impossible, it's different from completely blindsiding people. "She left loopholes" is not an excuse. It's BAD WRITING. DON'T excuse Meyer for it, just because you're devoted and want so desperately to believe it's good and okay. DON'T ignore things that she herself told you. DO think about it logically, even with the story's own internal logic. It fails itself repetitively, and everyone is out of character. I'll point out that people left 5 star reviews before they read the book. I'll also point out that most of those reviews are exceedingly short. They don't say much of anything. Think about what they actually say. I'm betting some were written out of loyalty to Meyer and Twilight, and this book doesn't deserve it. The book is shallow. Other five star reviews blatantly state they just really want the book, and you can't let that decide for you. "This is fiction," doesn't cut it as a reason that Meyer isn't consistent within her own universe. Even if you ignore that the writing has progressively gotten worse after each book she wrote, fiction still has to make sense within itself, or it's not worth anything. Fiction should still say something. Meyer's not saying anything except that Bella can get whatever she wants with no real sacrifice, and all girls should be shallow, have sex, and a great many of other truly appalling things. And she broke suspension of disbelief to do it, which is something you never want to do. "Think about Meyer's religion," doesn't cut it either. Why? Because she shouldn't be forcing her Mormon beliefs on us, and even so, she's creating a horrible role model that begs for sex. Begging for sex is stupid. The problem isn't necessarily that Bella's married at 18 so much as this entire thing is idealized. At the point at which this is passed off as the purest form of pure love and something all people should aspire to, it's bad. I don't believe it is true love, but Meyer says it is, and is saying that this is what all true love is like. And forcing your religious beliefs on the masses is wrong. At least, in the US it is. And seriously -HALF THE 5 STAR REVIEWS ARE WRITTEN BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK-. "Bella is IN LOVE with Edward it is completely different and she has had to SACRIFICE alot for this." No. Fail. She didn't sacrifice, because she got most of it back anyway. "I think the book is good, and maybe she wont publish midnight sun because of how bad people are saying Breaking Dawn is." Speaks for itself. Don't rate it good just because you think you won't get Midnight Sun. Trust me, Meyer will get it published. She has too many fangirls who'd buy anything she wrote."Isn't every book a glorified fanfic." No, actually. Meyer is fangirling all over herself on this one. Fanfiction is fiction written by fans, often used to create fantasies that the writer wished would happen themselves or making characters do things they wouldn't normally do, or are out of character. Not all fanfiction is like that, but a mass of it is. Meyer is writing her own characters out of character. That's bad. There's a confused definition between an author who likes their own writing and someone who squees over every line they write. Let me also point out that as of the time I checked, the most helpful favorable review had 1 out of 8 people say it was actually helpful. Negative? 66 out of 79. So before you buy all those happy reviews, think a little longer.If this review is making you mad, why? Because the Twilight Saga is your love? Because it has to be amazing? Well, it isn't. This is the only book I've ever found that I'd pronounce complete dreck. Ever.I don't mind the change in tone of the book. I love darker things. I love gore. That's not a problem.To the people who say that "you have to read with an open mind," fine. You can do that. But if thinking critically leads to the reasoning that it's not a good book, than it's not a good book. You shouldn't have to tell yourself not to think to be able to enjoy a book. There's a difference between keeping an open mind and accepting that pigs do in fact fly.Let me explain why I am not surprised. Twilight was a good book, for what it was. It's not deep literature, but it's an easy read, and it's cute--provided you don't try to look too deep for meaning. The writing itself wasn't amazing. Well, Meyer hadn't written anything before that, so it's not surprising. I finished reading the book, somewhat satisfied. I read it prepared to hate it, and I was pleasantly surprised I didn't have to, even if it'd never be my favorite and it was easy to poke holes in. Problems in that book include Bella being annoying as all hell as a first person perspective. You don't get a real sense for most of the other characters at all, and there're really flat. Jessica is written off as shallow while Bella is being shallow herself (Eric and Mike were only ever nice to her and without even knowing them Bella writes off Eric as a total overambitious geek and Mike as a puppy). He love of Edward focuses far too much on Edward's beauty, and not much on what actually makes them click together. For the sake of space, I direct you here http://otahyoni.livejournal.com/130432.html to see an actual count, and if you really want to know, the fact that Edward stalked Bella while she was sleeping before she even know him is creepy, not true love. There were flaws in the books. And then they got worse. New Moon was a train wreck. The pacing was horrible. Bella spends over half the book angsting without much actually happening, and to get over it she hooks up. Because You Are Never Complete Without Your Man. She takes months to get over it, which is unrealistic no matter how many times you claim their soulmates. There was no falling in love anywhere. Edward's and Bella's getting to know each other was a game of questionare, and knowing each other's favorite colors does not equal love. Edward wouldn't even let Bella ask him questions, instead insisting that she wasn't allowed. Jacob is better, and actually does something other than stare at Bella. Then he clings to her and angsts about being a werewolf in Now Moon, because somehow despite the fact that every single page in that book is dripping with angst and Bella being semi-suicidal, there's not enough of it yet. There's not subtlety to anything. And the whole plot is a mess and doesn't make sense. Other problems with the books as a whole are the vampire's vitual perfection, to the point that they're so overpowered there can hardly be much drama without Bella acting like an idiot (when we're told that she's super smart). The books are exceedingly repetitious, mostly on the points of angst and Edwards beauty. I find it irritating. "He's hot" shouldn't make up for a lack in personality. Bella's not allowed to actually be flawed, so everyone loves her for no reason. Having 5 guys after you is not realistic to the extent that it's played in the book. Being clumsy is not a fault when it disappears when convenient and is only used to make her look cute or relatable. I don't relate to Bella at all, and I'm almost 17. I get that Edward's a vampire, but there's not much actually shown that allows there to be any real feeling of danger. He says over and over that he's a danger, but he never backs it up. At that point, it doesn't matter, and when you can't see the fact that it's a problem beyond being told that it is, then it doesn't really exist the way it should. New Moon had literally 20 pages of Bella and Edward going back and forth telling each other they loved each other at the end, all very mushy and overdone, and I might have gotten a concussion with how hard Meyer hit me over the head with the Romeo and Juliet comparison. But she can't really pull subtle. Considering Juliet was na飗e and an idiot, and Romeo was lusty and a pimp, the comparison is just a little too perfect in all the wrong ways (seriously, read it. Romeo was after another girl when he saw Juliet and decided she was prettier). And I'm telling you I actually enjoyed reading Twilight. But it was flawed. And New Moon was worse. And Eclipse wasn't better.So why is it not surprising that Breaking Dawn is seriously this bad? Because while Twilight was good, for the easy read that it is, it wasn't a deep read, and you didn't have to think hard at all. New Moon and Eclipse honestly should have just been one book, because New Moon had about 500 unnecessary pages of angsting. Meyer has been getting worse and worse with each book she pumps out in the series, not better. And for the people who want to blame the pressure Meyer was under for the dreck in this book, don't. She said herself, many events in Breaking Dawn were originally in the direct sequel to Twilight, Forever Dawn, that got pegged. She'd had it written though, so Breaking Dawn wasn't under quite the same pressure as you'd think. Meyer was the one pressuring her publisher to let her go ahead with it. So don't blame pressure on this one. I could explain even more reasons why I'm not surprised this book is just not good, but it comes down to the fact that I think Meyer needs to actually consider working on her writing, as opposed to living off fans that will eat anything she gave them. Honestly, it's not fair to anyone who was enjoying her work to publish something this bad. Writing for yourself is fine. If you keep it to yourself. But I guess Meyer doesn't care about the fans. Listen, I'm not saying hate Twilight either. But if you take a look closer, you might see what I mean that it's not perfect, even if you don't agree. I was okay with Twilight by itself. The series should have ended there, like it was originally intended to. Because there's only so far that a bored housewife can push a book written about a dream she had of a sparkling vampire. As a complete sidenote, it might be interesting to note that the way Meyer describes Bella is very much like the way she herself looks. It's not directly in the books, but it's very exact. Considering I'm sure Meyer was in her own dream somewhere, the idea of it being a self-insert is entertaining, if not provable. But that's a complete other debate.Just, don't waste your money on this book. Get it from someone else if you must read it.</review>

<review id="7723">Ok, not happy.  I bought this machine because we used to have a commercial Keurig brewer where I used to work.  I was bonkers about that Gloria Jean's French Vanilla Supreme.  Anyways, I did the setup exactly as the instructions said--I even used bottled water instead of my filtered tap water.  On the first run-through (the one without a k-cup to purge the machine) a little water trickled out.  I figured, "Man, this thing must make a tiny cup of coffee."  Then I tried a K-Cup and the only thing that happened was a big loud noise like a jet engine.  There was no coffee.  I took the punctured K-Cup out and the grounds were dry.  Grrr....very disappointed.  I'm sticking with my Senseo pod brewer.  At least it makes a decent cup of coffee and doesn't sound like a plane about to crash into my house.</review>

<review id="7724">I really thought it was a great shaver, but it is not. It won't cut every hair in my face as they said in the advertaisment. My 70 dls.

<review id="7725">This is one of those companies that treat you like a thief after you purchase their product.  Installation is a nightmare -- solely to cut down on piracy -- and communication with this company is next to impossible.  Responses are rude and a long time in coming -- and cost $15 each.  A final point:  don't even think about trying to install on a firewalled machine, since the program seeks frequent unfettered access to the internet so as to (again at cost to you for benefit to them) make sure you're not using the program you paid them for illegally.  Appalling.</review>

<review id="7726">I purchased the Braun series 790 cc (9595) on November 14th.  Within less than a month, the shaver stopped working.  Blue power light is on, display indicates it has power, but shaver will not turn on at all.  Called Braun; they suggested I return it (at my cost) and they will refund me the purchase price of the shaver.  I told them I wanted a replacement; they don't do that, bring to a service center (no locations nearby) or return it for a refund.  Wow, that is some answer.  Do they really think I would then consider purchasing a replacement with their refund or that I would ever again buy a Braun?  For an item that cost over $200 and that I've had for less than a month, this is inexcusable.  Customer service extremely uninterested.</review>

<review id="7727">First i would like to say (like everyone else) Im in love with the twilight series!  I went to the midnight release party for BD and finished it within 24 hours.  This book was nothing like i expected.  As much as i did NOT like the fact that bella had a baby and got to keep everything perfect in her life...edward, becoming a vamp., jake as a best friend, and charlie (there was no great sacrafic that i had been preparing myself for)...i was SO much more upset that it just didnt feel like i was reading Edward and Bellas story.  The character connection was completely absent for me.  The ending was anti-climatic.  SM builds us up for this huge fight where the cullens and all the friends must stand against the corupt Volturi, they train, and practice, for what seems like half of the book.  Then in the scene where it should all go down, we get nothing!  I missed the connection between Edward and Bella, it felt like someone besides SM was writing BD.  I missed Alice.  I wish there was more description about the honeymoon night and maybe the first time they had sex as vamp. and less of the needles, time after time, fade to black sex implication.  I think if readers are old enough to handle a half vampire half human baby violently ripping itself out of its mother while the father tears open the uterus, they should be able to handle a scene of the physical act of true love that we all knew Edward and Bella had.  It makes me even more sad that there are ppl that loved this book.  I wish, so hard, that i loved this book.  I want to love it, and honestly regaurdless of what happened in the story i probably would have, if i felt the connection to all the characters like i had in the first 3.I still recommend that anyone interested in the series read this book only because this is how the author intened it to end.  Just be warned, you will NOT be dazzeled by this one like you have been by the others.This is so depressing....</review>

<review id="7728">Why? Because I accidentally removed it from my computer while transferring data. So what, you may say - you get yourself some corrupted files.No, all I got was physically damage sections in my hard drive. In other words, it rendered my Western MyPassport 320gb pretty much USELESS.Well, I know I'm not supposed to remove it without properly ejecting it. But it wasn't my fault. It wouldn't be my fault either if by any chances the power went down, or my computer froze. Now, physically damage the hard drive for that? My computer froze and shut down a dozen times and it's internal hard drive is still doing fine thank you very much.It would make a fine HDD - it's size is just right (not much bigger than an iPhone, not too small to lose it around the house). 320gb is a fair enough amount for my backups. Looks nice.But now a few other cons to it: it scratches (its plastic case) too easily and the usb cable is SHORT. At least is a common usb cable, but then again, it should have come with a larger one so I wouldn't have disconnected it accidentally thanks to its freaking short cable.After that incident, I tried to format it. You name it. I tried using its own recovery software - it wouldn't pass the initial tests - too much sectors were damaged. I tried formating it both Mac OS Extended Journaled and FAT32. I tried NTFS. Results: it would work for a few files, then after a large one it would simply crash. Or after a week or so of use, suddenly the data were all lost and it would tell "The Hard disk is in use and cannot be ejected". Oh great.I tried to write 0s (zeroes) on it. I tried the secure erase (7 times writing zeroes on it). I even tried 32 times-secure erasing process. It wouldn't pass the first 10% - too much damaged sectors. Now, for a simply and accidental removal? I mean, come on! A freaking flash drive can be removed without being ejected and still work fine. Any other kind of removable usb gadget can be without any physical harm. It could simply lose its system files or something. It could have just fragmented the files. But no...I'm not here to rant about whether the warranty policy should be and even if I had returned it I wouldn't be happy with this purchase. And that's what my review is about - an unfortunate purchase. I was expecting more from this, a bit more reliable than it actually is.Again, if you wanna buy this, make sure you put it on an altar away from hands, dogs and natural phenomena such as wind, fire and rain. And make sure you use a super-duper long range usb cable glued on both ends - glue it on your HDD and on your computer. Don't ever, never, for any reason, even being your power, remove this piece of junk from your computer without ejecting it first. And if by any chances it freezes or corrupt data while using it and then it tells you that "USB Mass Storage is in use and C A N N O T be ejected", well my friend I wish you good luck. You never know what lies ahead with this worthless piece of junk.</review>

<review id="7729">I guess I have to join the chorus of other one star reviewers .  This router worked great for about 6 months and then I started experiencing disconnects.  I tried everything suggested by the Linksys support forums and nothing worked.  One thing I noticed is that there were a lot of other people on those forums AND Amazon reviewers who shared this issue.  One reviewer on Amazon said that this was a known issue with this router and that Linksys should issue some kind of firmware patch.  I couldn't wait for that as I make my living via the computer and constant disconnects are simply impossible for me to do business.  I make my living trading stocks so you can imagine the frustration of not knowing when the next disconnect would occur.  Anyway, I probably should have read more of the one star reviews than the 5 star reviews.  I usually purchase based on price and the reviews, but sometimes that is just not good enough.  I was so frustrated I went to the local Microcenter and purchased a $40 Netgear G router and right now it's working fine with no bumps whatsoever.</review>

<review id="7731">Wow, I've never felt the need to write a review before, but Microsoft 2007 is horrible. I bought it for my laptop because I need it for school, but I really regret it. I wish I had bought 2003 instead; it's so much easier to use than 2007. This edition I use mainly for Word, but I've also used Powerpoint. At first I thought it was going to take a little time to get used to, but then it would be an upgrade from the old version. How wrong I was. I've had it installed for over 2 months and it's gotten no better. One thing I've noticed is that it keeps trying to change things without me telling to, such as when I'm trying to format my document, create an outline, tab correctly to type an MLA bibliography, everything - it's trying to help by assuming I meant to do something (and thus doing it for me) when I REALLY don't want to! It's horrible! And forget the help button too - it doesn't exist in this version. All I'm trying to do is get my work done for school, but it takes me FOREVER just trying to get it the way it has to be formatted becase that's not how Word 2007 wants it to look. This is a pain in my a**, and my friends who have this and are used to 2003 all agree with me - why is it so difficult? It really shouldn't be. So I urge you all - look at 2003 if you have the option, it's much easier to use even if it doesn't have the spiffy new appearance of 2007.</review>

<review id="7732">What was going on in the minds of these so-called MS-Office "geniuses" when they decided to enhance the new MS-Office programs?  Did they ever stop to think that even the average student is finding it difficult to get their work done, because they can't even locate where the print icon is or why they couldn't open their document, because they forgot to save it under a converter to 97-2003 version?Isn't it so much easier to have kept the orginal formatted version of 2003 and just add the enhancements according to its category?  I'm suppose to be a computer instructional assistant who mentors students who range from having excellent knowledge of computers to absolutely NO knowledge of computers whatsoever...Yes, that's right...People who have "NO" knowledge of computers whatsoever...And the funny thing about it is - the ones that DO have excellent knowledge of computers come to me for help, because they can't figure out how to simiply cut-copy-and paste their document...That got me there!Since we both were having an extremely difficult time following the darn textbook, I just showed 'em how to do it the shortcut way...The best way I knew how ~ right click on your mouse. LMAO!Here's another issue ~ if Microsoft isn't willing to revert back to the original way they started out their software...I sure as hell am not willing to spend more than $450.00 for the newer version.  I'd rather much be happier with 2003's version.</review>

<review id="7733">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)       This book perturbed me. A lot. Though I did enjoy Ms. Meyer's first installation of this series very much (even though the vampires glitter. go figure.) this one fell quite short of even being engaging. The Fault line? The protagonist. Where in Twilight Bella is her own person, intelligent, competent and refreshingly mature for her age, in New Moon she is selfish, codependent, bored, boring, stupid, irrational and just all around irritating. Instead of being someone who makes things happen, most of the book's major events transpire as a result of Bella's odd gravitational pull for danger. This gets old. Very old. Mostly, it is Bella's irreverent and irate actions that pull the story down and drown the reader. After a certain event (avoiding spoilers here) near the start of the book, Bella simply dissolves into a puddle of pathetic mush. Why should I give a hoot about her if she doesn't even give a hoot about her?? Never once did I feel an ounce of pity for her. Truthfully, she had more than enough for herself. Get a grip Bella! Pick yourself up! Be a strong character! DO something for crying out loud!     If I could smack her, I would.  P.S.     This book's saving grace was Jacob Black, the only character I could sympathize with. Don't worry Jacob, you're not missing much...</review>

<review id="7734">I ordered this DVD from Netflix and we played it twice.  All in family concluded that they didn't want to watch it again.  This is from a 2 1/2 year old girl, a 4 1/2 year boy and a 10 year old girl.  My girls love many of the songs we play from YouTube, like "Part of Your World", but the evil enchantress and the sharks that "kill" make it all too scary for them.  My kids have 100's of DVDs, and preferred titles are: Angelina Ballerina, Ratatouille, Cars, Baby Enstein box set, Teletubbies, Rescue Hero, Alphabet Train, Dora the Explorer, Bob the Builder, Maisy, Kipper, Mickey Mouse (not all the old ones though), Winnie the Pooh Friendship series DVDs, Heffalump Movie, and Wiggles Big Red Car to name the favorites.  Wish there was an option to select and play "preschool" edition minus all the scary parts.  Even our 10 year old thought too scary, and said Cinderella was the only one that doesn't scare her of all the Disney movies.</review>

<review id="7735">This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) (DVD)      The previews for this film were incredible!  It looked like it may be the coolest movie ever filmed.  And then I saw it.  And I thought about it for a while afterwards.  While the special effects and the sound effects were awesome, pretty much every other aspect of this film was so bad that it was hilarious. It's blatantly obvious that the entire budget went to FX and paying Jon Voight.  I'm not a professional writer, but I could have written a better screenplay for this film.  Just about everyone I know could have written a better screenplay for this film.  The editing floor must contain the majority of the plot, because not much of it made it into the actual movie.  There was no attempt made at developing the characters.  Instead, we were thrown a few lines of awkward dialogue to explain a few aspects of plot, that in the end made you wonder why they even bothered.  We didn't need to know that the beautiful girl could overhaul engines.  It didn't matter that her father was a car thief.  It didn't matter that she had a juvie record, because they did such a horrible job with integrating these lame attempts at giving her a reason for even being in the film.  Since they didn't even bother trying to pretend she wasn't cast entirely to draw men and boys to the movie, they shouldn't have wasted time giving her such a pathetic story.  She was not hired for her acting ability.It seemed like they had a few ideas of where to go with the plot, and began to lay seeds for them to grow.  But along the way, they abandoned them to the weeds.  The special effects and sound effects were so good, it was worth seeing for that alone.  In fact, the rest of the movie was so bad that it was accidently hilarious.  I will be purchasing the DVD set because of the FX, and also the fact that everything else is so ridiculous that it's actually entertaining.</review>

<review id="7739">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      Stephenie Meyer, New Moon (Little, Brown, 2006)I will warn you now that I can't get into New Moon's fundamental flaws without discussing THE major spoiler in the book, so if you have not yet read it and are planning to, then skip this review; it's going to discuss the book's Big Reveal in detail (or enough detail to give the game away, anyway). Now, with that said, on to the review.As I noted in my review of Twilight, I am in no way fond of Stephenie Meyer's ability to write, but she's good enough with plotting that I started this hot on the heels of finishing the first one just because I wanted to know what happened. (I'll mention right now that I did not have the same reaction after this one was done; it took me almost a month to pick up Eclipse, and it has taken me as long again to get one hundred pages into that one; I may even abandon it.) And New Moon continues on with Meyer's excellence in plotting, though the shale base upon which the plotting sits shatters even farther in this book, and by the time you're halfway through, the footing is slippery indeed. Plotting alone is not enough to save a book where everything else is shot, and that is the case with the latter half of New Moon.Plot: after the events that ended Twilight, Edward has realized that his presence causes Bella more danger than she could ever cause herself, and he disappears from the scene, throwing Bella into a very, very deep depression that lasts months. It also leads to thoughts that are not exactly suicidal, but perhaps more thrillseeking than usual (whether this is an attempt at death or an attempt at feeling alive is actually an interesting question, but one which Meyer, of course, never looks deep enough to address). She's also hanging out a lot more with Jacob, the Native American chap from Twilight. And the main plot stems from this: some of Jacob's old friends have suddenly become distant, and Jacob is worried that they may be into drugs. The truth of the matter is far more complex, as Bella discovers when Jacob, after disappearing for a weekend, adopts the same mindset. Meanwhile, whenever Bella does something stupid, she torments herself with thoughts of Edward admonishing her--or is that really Edward's voice reaching to her from, well, wherever he may be?Yep, just as before, there's an awful lot going on here, and the plot moves along so swiftly that one is able to forget, or at least put aside, the Barbara Cartland-level cookie-cutter-romance writing, the cardboard characters whose emotions exist solely to fit the plotline, the settings so generic that the characters may as well be acting in front of a blue screen, and all the other shortcomings the book has. But then we get halfway through, and there's the big reveal. And in case you weren't listening in the first paragraph, here's where you really, really need to stop reading, because the beginning of the next paragraph reveals the Big Reveal. Got it?The book--and the series in general--immediately devolves into vampires vs. werewolves, a clich?so tired that no serious horror novelist, and for that matter no aspiring horror novelist, however bad, would even consider doing such a thing any more. But Meyer, of course, is not a horror writer, she's a romance novelist. And most of her readers are also not horror fans (or this book would have gotten the trashing it so throughly deserves long before this). It's so bad that even Bella's absolutely ludicrous reactions to everything around her, and everyone around her's ludicrous reactions to Bella (if losing your boyfriend sends you into a depression lasting four months, you need professional help, and if your father, your friends, and your guidance counselors don't recognize that, you need to emancipate yourself and find a new family, a new school, and new friends), start looking like the best part of the book. I had original given this two and a half stars, but reliving it for this review has been so distasteful I knocked a star off in hindsight. I can't believe I finished it. I can't believe even more that I picked up Eclipse at all. * ?</review>

<review id="7744">I like the Razor mice, the basic ones are great, but unless you want to be the most frustrated person in the world, stay clear of this mouse. Why you ask? well I bought this mouse because of the 9 buttons. I'm a gamer, and my mouse died, so I decided to splurge and buy a nice expencive mouse that would probably last me many years. The problem, as others have pointed out, is there are 2 buttons on EACH side of the mouse. this means it's almost impossible to click one button on one side without the presure of squeezing clicking the opposite side. These constant missclicks can be overcome by a lot of practice im sure, but take it from me, unless you really need 9 buttons for whatever reason, buy a different mouse. Again, the standard razor is pretty cool.</review>

<review id="7745">This review is from: Howard the Duck (VHS Tape)      This film effectively put an end to the careers of Willard Huyck (co-writer & director) and Gloria Katz (co-writer & producer).  Good riddance!  George Lucas (executive producer) is lucky that he always has the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises to fall back on.One can only imagine what was going through everyone's minds when they decided that "Howard The Duck" just had to be brought to the big screen.  This is truly a one joke movie stretched out for an abhorrent 110 minutes.  Howard is a walking and talking duck (of course!) who lives on a planet where ducks have evolved into the predominant species.  He is accidentally zapped by a laser shot off into space by some scientists here on Earth (Don't ask!).  He ends up being sucked off of his home planet and ends up here on our planet.A chance encounter brings him face to face with a struggling musician named Beverly, played by Lea Thompson.  She takes the feathered phenomenon home with her and develops an awkward relationship with him.  Perhaps I don't fully appreciate the innuendos made about bestiality in this movie.  Anyway,  the story soon spirals wildly out of control when the scientists use their laser again.  This time it has zapped a dark overlord (No...I'm not kidding!) to our planet.  Not surprisingly, the overlord isn't interested in sightseeing and getting to know Earth's inhabitants.  Instead, he wants to bring a few of his demon friends down here and extinguish all of the Earthlings.Everything culminates in a rather dull and predictable ending.  The jokes fall flat in "Howard The Duck" and the action sequences are strictly run of the mill as well.  I guess the good news is that I have seen worse movies than this one.  But not many.</review>

<review id="7746">This player worked GREAT!!.. at first! I'd seen some reviews about this player stating that it just stopped working, but bought one anyways thinking that mine would somehow be different. Three weeks later it randomly just began freezing when I turned the player on... Luckily it was still within Amazon's return time limit, so I had it replaced.. BIG MISTAKE.. i should have gotten a refund!! Four months later (Way out of the return time frame), my "new" player began to do the same thing!! For the last month and a half I tried emailing Sansa's "customer service" email address, and haven't gotten a single response. This is the worst thing you could spend your money on!! Other people give it great ratings, but that's because they haven't had it long enough for it to break down on them!! Now I've spent 70 bucks and have nothing to show for it...

Customer help is laughable.Tax time, especially in this year of fiscal chaos, rip-off "stimuli", corporate piracy, and administration tax-dodgers, is not my idea of fun a anyway...but this POS just put the cherry on top.My taxes are a little different this year, which I why I went with the "Deluxe" (!) Looks like I will just have to sharpen up some pencils and go back to the old way of doing things.Thanks for NOTHING, Turbo Tax!</review>

<review id="7748">I've used Quicken for Windows since 1994 and have been quite pleased with it.  I've updated every few years, and am currently using Quicken 2005 Deluxe for Windows XP on my PC.  I have no major complaints about the Windows versions that I've used.Last year, I bought my first Mac (the last of the G5 iMacs).  I fell in love with it and I now use it for everything except finances.  My Mac came with a free version of Quicken for Mac, and I assumed that I'd just be able to start it up and have instant access to the Quicken data on my PC over my home network.  However, Quicken for Mac would not recognize my Quicken file, nor would it restore the backup files.  So I assumed that this was because it was some sort of free stripped-down trial version that had expired, or something like that.  I therefore recently purchased the latest and greatest version of Quicken for Mac (2007), assuming that this would do the trick and that I could finally junk my rusty PC.  WRONG.  The full-priced "full-featured" 2007 version of Quicken for Mac wouldn't read my existing Quicken files, either.  So I looked in the instructions and found a blurb about converting a Quicken for Mac file to a Quicken for Windows file, but found nothing about converting from Windows to Mac.I had to search the Quicken website to find a document explaining how to convert a Quicken database from Windows to Mac.  It quickly became very clear that if you're a long-time user of Quicken for Windows and you want to convert to Quicken for Mac, you're basically screwed.  Unless, that is, you've only been using Quicken for a few simple tasks such as balancing your checkbook.  If, like me, you have multiple investment accounts of various types with records going back many years, you might has well forget about converting to Quicken for Mac.For starters, it turns out that there are a lot accounts and reports that simply won't convert at all, so you'll just have to lose those. For example, Quicken for Windows handles 401(k) accounts (a fairly common type of account).  Quicken for Mac does not.  So you can kiss your 401(k) data goodbye.  Same with Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable (fairly common things for those of us with home businesses).  Same with Memorized Reports, Security Price Histories, etc.If you decide that you can live without such things, you can proceed with the adventure of converting your Windows data to Mac data.  Note that no conversion utility exists, so you have to do an enormous amount of hand-editing of the database.  The conversion process requires that you go through all transaction categories supported by the Windows version and look for those with names longer than 15 characters.  The instructions don't make it clear whether a blank space counts as a character, but I assume it does.  You're supposed to rename these categories to bring them within the 15 character limit.  Quicken 2005 for Windows has at least one such category that cannot be renamed (Quicken simply won't let you do it).  The others can be renamed, however.Then you have to rename any accounts that are longer than 15 characters.Then you have to edit your securities list to make sure every ticker symbol is all-caps.Then, if you have a mutual fund account that contains any RtrnCapX transactions, you have to change that mutual fund account to a regular investment account.OK, now you've done all that.  The next step is to go through all your accounts one at a time, look at each transaction, and manually change the categories for certain transactions.  There are 7 transaction types that exist in the Windows version but not in the Mac version.  For example, MargInt (margin interest expense) does not exist in the Mac version, so you have to find every single margin interest event in your records and manually change it to a miscellaneous expense, with a note in the comment field that it's for margin interest.  Then you have to do similar conversions for the six other transaction types that aren't supported.  For example, every MiscIncX transaction has to be manually changed to a combination of a MiscInc and an XIn.  If you have multiple accounts containing more than a decade's worth of transactions (as I do), this becomes a formidable task.There's more to do after this, but this was the point at which I threw up my hands and decided that it's just not worth it.  I'd have to hand-edit hundreds of transactions in my Quicken database and hope that I got them all right.  Then I'd have to live with a version of Quicken that lacks many of the features to which I've become accustomed over the years.Quicken offers an option where you can send them your file and have them convert it for you, but they won't convert the non-supported transactions to supported ones.  So, for example, you'd simply lose all records of your margin interest expense.  They claim, however, that they'll arrange things so that the correct balance is preserved in each account even though all those transactions will be missing.  How nice.  And if you want to use their conversion services, you have to go through a lot of rigamarole just to get them to do it.  So, I'm stuck with a useless piece of software that I downloaded from Intuit's online store for $60.Looks like I'll have to keep my PC running until I get an Intel Mac that will allow me to use Bootcamp.  Also, rumor has it that the Leopard version of OS X, when running on an Intel Mac, will allow you to run Windows XP applications directly under OS X (without rebooting and without emulation), but this is still just a rumor.This experience has left me with a very low opinion of Intuit.</review>

<review id="7750">I read the description, but not carefully enough. The text under Entourage 2008 says there is Exchange Server support which is what I needed. However, after I got the product and couldn't configure the Exchange Server support, I went back and re-read it closer and it says "Office 2008 for Mac and Office 2008 Special Media Edition enable users to access their Microsoft Exchange server accounts with Entourage" I think it is very misleading for the description of the product to discuss the features of another product. I am writing to Amazon and asking for a refund, but I am not holding my breath.</review>

<review id="7751">I absolutely loved this toothbrush, it gave me the cleanest brush I ever had without going to the dentist office.  The variable settings are a great feature.  Since it is so expensive, my husband and I would share the toothbrush and use our own heads (using the same head would just be gross.)  We honestly thought the price tag was worth it and were planning on buying a second one so we didn't have to always take turns.However, 8 months after purchasing this wonder brush, it has developed a mind of it's own.  It extremely loud and distracting when it is in use, don't bother trying to listen to anyone talk to you unless they're yelling.  It also turns itself on periodically, and I must say the random buzzing while I was in the shower took me by surprise.We now plan on investing our money in a toothbrush that will hopefully last quite a bit longer.  My last electric toothbrush lasted over 3 years and it just doesn't seem reasonable to spend over $100 on a toothbrush that can't even last year.  However,  if money is not an object for you, I would recommend this product.</review>

<review id="7752">The product worked great for making smoothies, pina coladas, margaritas, etc.  VERY convenient design, however unfortunately the rotating screw nut at the bottom of the blade attachment got stripped! Somebody also mentioned this. It will eventually strip because the blender design is not very stable--the vibrations are the cause for the stripped grinder blade attachment.. I still have the smaller blade attachment, but I don't expect that one to last very long either.The &quot;Free Bonus! Full-Size Blender AND Juice Extractor!&quot; claim is a gimmick.  The Juicer attachment works ABYSMALLY, and does NOT do the same job as a regular juicer.  I have no idea how they did it, but it looked great on TV.. False advertising.I wouldn't recommend this product for it's shoddy workmanship.It's unfortunate because it actually works great until the blade gets stripped.  I suggest one of those hand mixers that mix the drinks directly in a large cup (I had one of those before I bought this one).  You can run it in clean water to rinse it off and you're done. They also cost 1/5 the price.</review>

<review id="7753">To all of you people complaining about those of us who low-rank this product due to the marketing/manufacturing, deal with it. I'm also PO'd at both the DVD manufacturer as well as with Amazon. Where on this product page does it say this is season 4.0 AND the Razor movie? I can deal with the split season. They did it once before. Fine. But I just opened my package and found the Razon disc inside. I got Razor a year ago when it came out and was totally hyped. There was no reason at all they needed to include it in this package. This is a crock.Blah blah blah, the show is still good, but the story is getting a little hokey. It's still a quality show, most people know this. That's why I'm focusing my review on the DVD product itself.Editing review to add that the Amazon page currently is displaying one of their Frequently Bought Together packages...Season 4.0 + Season 3 + RazorPrice for all three: $79.96Way to go, Amazon.</review>

<review id="7757">UPDATE JUNE 23, 2008:To update my rating, I give 1 star to the condensation sensor design, 5 stars to the rest of the camera.After 3 weeks turnaround, Canon returned the camcorder to me. They graciously covered cost of shipping when I first called in the issue, and they e-mailed me a UPS slip to sent to the New Jersey facility. I've done some early tests on the repaired camcorder and it seems the condensation sensor is not as finicky as before. They said it was 'repaired', but didn't specify whether they dialed down the sensitivity or disabled condensation sensor altogether. Good thing the warranty lasts for a full year. :-)Outside of this repair issue, this is an excellent camcorder. Has a microphone input, great video quality, and very easy to upload video. I hope to enjoy using it for many years to come. Will continue to test it before arrival of our first child due in September! :-)ORIGINAL REVIEW:Through casual use, the condensation error has come up more than 75% of the time I've tried using it. I think the sensor is oversensitive in order to protect the camera, but at at unreasonable cost to the consumer, because it is no longer useful for "convenient" use.I am not using it in highly humid environments, so this is particularly frustrating. I have missed several important video footage occasions due to uncooperative condensation error. Stay away from this camera. I have emailed Canon about this problem and I'll update here when I get more news from them.UPDATE JUNE 17, 2008:The camcorder arrived June 4 in NJ facility, but they haven't been able to track the camcorder down (should only have taken 3 to 5 days). I just sent the following email to Canon Support (with minor edits).---- EXCERPT START ----Hello Sir/Madam,I'm writing to ask Canon USA to take necessary steps to expedite our camcorder repair issue.Kelly from NJ service center is looking for our ZR930 that arrived by UPS on June 4 (almost 2 weeks ago). The camcorder still has not been found. We are expecting our first baby very soon, and we are getting extremely anxious! The camcorder suffers from a hypersensitive condensation fault, and was only 35 days old when I sent it for service. It is practically new, as I've only taped 3 hours of footage. The condensation fault has appeared almost 80% of the time I've tried to use it, a very poor performance record. I have asked NJ facility to reduce its sensitivity or disable the condensation sensor altogether.I cannot rely on this camcorder to tape my new baby given the current condensation warning behavior. We have already missed the taping of my wife's PhD convocation and our last chance to see the space shuttle on the launchpad in Florida due to the condensation warnings. (Outdoor conditions were no different than a regular day at the baseball stadium)Please let me know what actions will be taken by Canon USA. We simply want a working Canon camcorder that does not give false or conservative condensation errors on a regular basis. While the user manual mentions the issue, it gives no indication to the user that these faults can be so frequent, and if so, on what basis (i.e. specify the exact humidity and temperature fluctuations and conditions necessary to trip the sensor). Otherwise, this camcorder will forever feel like a "hit or miss" recording device. Even cell phone cameras can reliably take low quality images. (The key here being "reliably").We are deeply disappointed with Canon USA on this particular issue (we are Canon digital camera fans) and desperate to hear from Canon about our camcorder. The cynical side of me feels oversensitive condensation warnings in MiniDV camcorders is the current marketing ploy to encourage consumers to adopt the newer and more expensive hard drive based camcorders which yield larger profit margins. Such condensation issues were not as prevalent with older MiniDV camcorders before flash based camcorders came along. Please prove us wrong, Canon!I hope to hear from you asap!---- EXCERPT END ----</review>

<review id="7763">The blade mechanism on this chopper is extremely difficult to remove or adjust.  I have very small fingers, and there is still barely enough room between the two blades for me to press on the plastic ring to remove it.  I can't imagine how someone with large fingers would manage.  My husband and I both sliced our fingers numerous times the first time we assembled this and tried to change the blade position, so I read the manual to see if we were doing it wrong.  Well, the diagram in the manual doesn't correspond to the actual machine, so it's useless.  On top of the danger, it doesn't even do that good of a job chopping.  There's nothing I can do in this thing that I can't do better and more easily with my hand-held blender.  Save your money AND your fingers!  Steer clear of this thing!</review>

After installation it tells you to get the upgrade to R2, which will hang permanently while it looks for MS Outlook. Quicken support told me to uninstall and then refuse the upgrade. The online banking is so bad I uninstalled it and reinstalled 2007. When enabling transaction download, 2009 insists that you create a new account, even though you''re trying to online-enable an existing one, so you have to copy all the transactions over to the new account. I had to disable and re-enable several accounts to get online banking to work at all, and then after a week it started displaying error messages about locked accounts (which worked fine after reinstalling 2007). I recommend you avoid 2009 until Intuit fixes it, which will be R3 or later. If you use online banking, it's not usable right now.</review>

<review id="7766">When I received the coffemaker the sticker used to identify the switches and their functions had peeled off.  I tried to put it back on but it would not stick.  I tried to use the automatic timer feature so coffee would be ready when I woke but it didn't work.  I could set time to start brewing but when the clock hit 12:00am it stopped.  When I would wake there would not be any coffee prepared.  Although it was just a matter of turning it on manually, I bought it for the automatic feature.  I suppose I could have gone through the process of returning it but the hassle and turnaround time to get a new one was not worth the purchase price.  I needed a new coffeemaker so I went to the local department store and bought a new one.</review>

<review id="7775">I reluctantly have to say that Office 2007 is one of the worst products I've used. I'm forced to provide at least one star, but I wish I could give it ZERO stars, so how about it Amazon. Isn't it time we can give zeros??I've been using Word for over 20 years and have used Excel, Access, and Powerpoint heavily for the past 10-15 years. I'm an advanced user of the tools and MS Office suites (including Project, Visio, Outlook,, et. al). If you have experience with any previous Office suite, run away now. If you've never used any previous versions of Office, you won't realize how bad this is so try it at your own risk, but I'd still say skip it.MS's "ribbon" has got to be one of the worst ideas any company has ever forced on its customers. It is not a productivity feature, instead it's an untenable waste of real productivity and time. It is however, a testament to MS's ignorance and that of their "test users" and researchers. While that may sound rough, read the other reviews here; the same negative theme gets repeated and there's a good reason. The tools we've all used for so long are simply gone, the ability to accomplish simple tasks are gone, and the worst thing is there's no quick way to get them back. This product is not evolutionary, it's a genetic dead end and simply unrelated to anything meaningful...I'm not going to go into every problem as I'm sure there's a limit on how much I can type here and how much you may want to read, but I will tell you that after spending more time than it's worth to accomplish simple tasks like opening templates (or even seeing them), I've decided to uninstall this application and go back to Office 2003 on all our PCs. I tried this software for several months and I can't stand it. MS should find a new product manager for the Office suite because the current one either deliberately wanted to alienate existing customers or didn't consider them. Either reason is cause for dismissal...The negative reviews here should warn you; there's are serious and fatal problems with Office 2007. If you have any doubt as to what to do, I'll say it clearly; DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!</review>

<review id="7778">I bought TaxCut because at the time TurboTax had a stupid policy of charging an extra $10 for each printed tax return.  They later reversed this, but I had already started preparing a year-end planning pro forma return using TaxCut.  Now that I've used the product, it would have been better to stick with TurboTax even if I had to pay extra to print a planning return.  (And of course, now TurboTax has dropped that stupid charge, so it's no longer a problem.)TaxCut advantages:  (1) it's a little cheaper, and (2) it has some limited audit protection service built in.  While I don't think it's as good as the extra-cost ($35) audit offering available for TurboTax, but for a relatively simple return it may save you from buying that kind of insurance.  That's it.  In every other way TurboTax is better.Here are just some of the TaxCut deficiencies:  (1) Interview is MUCH less thorough.  I found numerous areas where TurboTax takes you through detail with explanations while TaxCut just has you fill in a number without a lot of explanation.  (2) One-click relevent help for each entry -- TaxCut often sends you to a generic help page that's not relevent, while TurboTax usually gives you immediate specific details about that particular line.  The TaxCut online help is poor. (3) One-click access to itemized lists.  Both products let you enter a mini-spreadsheet to sum totals for any entry.  But when you go to re-open a list, TurboTax takes you right to the list, while TaxCut just gives you a menu of all the lists in your return, with no hint of which is which other than Form and Line Number.  If you have a form open you can know the form and line number, but if you're in the middle of an interview screen you need to have it all memorized, or else open the lists by trial and error. (4) Import from Quicken had a number of errors which needed manual correction.I could go on with user interface and feature deficiences, but I'll close with problems when installing updates.  I went through a lot of trouble when the product said it needed to update itself, which it proceeded to do, except the update didn't actually happen so it kept saying it still needed an update.  TaxCut support responded promptly via online chat, but gave me bad advice involving dubious system startup changes.  I actually found the solution in another one of these Amazon reviews when I did Google searches to find people who might have answers.  This burned off a number of hours I could have spent doing something else!I do think TaxCut is adequate for relatively simple returns but I'm giving it a low 2-star rating because the alternative is quite a bit better and the prices aren't much different.PS when comparing prices, don't forget that the cost to do STATE efile is big.  (TurboTax also dings you for state efile.) Remember that to gain the benefit of TaxCut's bundled audit assistance for your state return, you must efile.PPS I also reviewed TurboTax 2008 when users were rebelling against the stupid pay-for-print policy.  At the time I gave them one star, but now that the policy has changed I would raise my rating, except Amazon has no way to change a rating once published.  If you happen to see both reviews, TurboTax is the better product.</review>

<review id="7781">Water fountains for pets is a great idea but I'm still waiting for somebody who actually owns pets to create the perfect water fountain that isn't so expensive. This one has too many cons for it's cost ($50.00 at Petco), so I will be returning mine. Besides being overpriced here are other cons: it's too loud, which freaks out skittish cats.  It requires a filter, which costs more money. It doesn't hold enough water (extra water reservoir sold separately, more $$ down the drain). It's not easy to clean and you'll end up cleaning it more often than the pamphlet says you'll need to. The flow adjuster is too cheaply made to be useful and it'll break easily.

Let's forget for a moment that this just a bad attempt at converting people.  Let's talk about the non bash you over the head with a sappy message moments.  Cameron's performance isn't horrible.  He actually has a few moments in the film where you might buy him as a human being.  That can't be said for the rest of the cast.  Listening to some of the lines delivered, was almost unbearable.  This would be hard pressed to make it as a Lifetime movie of the week.  I can only assume that most of these actors were pulled out of the local community.  So it isn't there fault.  It's the producers.  At no point during the film did I connect with, or care about any one in the film.  If only I was addicted  to porn.  The comedy beats, or the attempted comedy beats, all fall flat.  The two action sequences are about the only thing that made me laugh.  No sense of peril at all.  I realize they probably were working on a ridiculously low shoe string budget, but that's no excuse  You don't large scale effects, or set pieces to create nail biting suspense.  You do however need good writing.  Good direction, Good editing, and good acting.  This one missed on all counts.What I don't get about this movie is what they are attempting to do with it.  I know they are trying to witness to people through the screen, but the only people it's going to connect with, are the people that have already sipped the Cool Aid. So, really.  What's the point.  If you're a non Christian, this movie is laughable in the points it tries to convey.  If you're a Christian, you would be much better off seeing one of your congregations stage plays, about the dangers of pornography, abortion, atheism, secularism, humanism, evolution, other religions, rock music, or the gays.</review>

<review id="7785">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      Sorry to be so negative here, but this "movie", if you can truly call this cg-fueled Splenda fest that, is terrible.  First off, nearly *EVERY* movie based on a comic book/toy line is severely lacking in artistic credibility, because nearly every movie of this type takes liberties with the source material.  And the examples of this are endless.  From liberties taken with the storylines(X-men being the prime example of this. Also, see the newer batman movies, and heck even the last couple of ones made in the 90's), to rampant, pitiful miscastings(once again, the so-called "x-men franchise" takes the cake here - I mean c'mon....who in the heck could ever picture Wolverine being some girly-faced Aussie limp wrist?!?!?!?).  So with all that said who in their right mind would make a movie based on an 80 toy line and cartoon?? Answer, some talent-and-originality-impaired IDIOTS that are who.  Sorry, but as a dyed-in-the-wool Transformers fan- or more specifically, of the toy line which was imported here from Japan in '84, all I can say is this movie truly STINKS.  Now don't get me wrong, the storyline does indeed reek (as any "story" that attempts to use current events as fodder is lame, to say the least), the storyline never really mattered much to me.  Let's face it, the old 80's cartoon wasn't all that, as far as animated fare went, as it was just a promotional tool to get kids to bug their folks to buy them the toys.  Heck the toys sold themselves, as far as I was concerned.  So to sum up, the storyline of this odious flick is inconsequential.  However my main bone of contention is the way the characters (the Transformers that is) are depicted.  It's bad enough that the characters, who in their original-and dare I say PURER-renditions transformed into a variety of real-world vehicles from a variety of manufacturers-transform only into american-made JUNK in this sad waste of celluloid.  It's even worse that the Transformers, in their robot modes, look far worse than AWFUL - It looks to my eyes, like some chump with an H.R. Giger fetish and a couple hundred thousand boxes of Erector sets designed them -- and threw in some Battlebots and Mad Max elements in there for fun. And the way they move and lumber about, like some Mechwarrior reject, is laughably pathetic.  I also have problems with the way at least one of characters, Bumblebee, to be specific, was portrayed.  I'm sorry, Mr. Bay, that you don't like VW beetles, but that's what Bumblebee TF'd into.  And also, since when in the heck was Bumblebee ever a warrior?!?  You know, maybe, just MAYBE, if the people responsible for this waste of celluloid and CG did the extra legwork, and got the license from the various automakers (Porsche AG, Freightliner, etc, etc) involved in the designs of the original TF characters, and heck even used the ORIGINAL and downright better, timeless designs, then maybe you could've had a winner here.  But as such, all you have is formulaic, CG-driven DRIVEL, "lovingly crafted" in the endless factory of mediocrity that is hollywood.  Which will be undoubtedly gobbled down by the clueless masses that are the moviegoers.  Sorry, but due to the fact that Amazon doesn't allow no-star ratings, I give this one star.</review>

<review id="7786">I believe a terribly written manual and equally poor customer service person was the source of my problems.  My problem started with the memory stick.  I inserted it and tried to record video to it.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find the screen prompt as shown in the manual.  I called Customer Service and waited patiently while the service rep. read through the manual.  He certainly wasn't familiar with this model.  Finally, he advised me that this model (DCR 610) is not able to record video to the memory stick - only still shots.  At first this sounded plausable because the manual covers 3 different models and describes many exceptions for the different models.  But due to the service rep's hesitancy, I wasn't totally convinced.Later that day I sent an e-mail to SONY Customer Service with the same question about the memory stick(can you believe that SONY restricts written questions to 256 characters?).  Later that night I was trying to find the function to record to disc and saw the screen prompt for the memory stick.  I selected it and it "worked".  The next morning I received an e-mail from Sony confirming that video can be recorded on memory stick.  SONY also apologized for the misinformation I received.Eventually I turned the camera over to my son as a gift.  He was having more success with it than I until he tried to dub/copy video from the memory stick to a disc.  He said he couldn't find the screen prompt as described in the manual.I thought I might like this camera for myself, but it got to be too frustrating trying to make basic functions work.  Both Canon and Panasonic have DVD Camcorders with approx. 40x zooms.  I'll take a look at those.</review>

<review id="7787">Each year I do my taxes with Turbo tax and it works flawlessly until I get to the import section for financial institutions. This year's hassle: Importing Etrade data. I buy and sell a lot of stock as a junior day trader- say about 100-150 trades a year. On Etrade, my capital gains and losses are recorded but when I import this data to Turbo Tax ONLY the closing net amount is calculated. This results is ballooning my income and tax due into the stratosphere.The painful part is having to go and hand-edit each every trade to make the cost basis and actual gain or loss appear correctly. Oh and if you just want to delete all the imported data and do it all by hand? Sorry- delete all 150 items one at a time or delete and start the whole return over again. Why so awkward TurboTax???This is a real painful process that should be automatic at this point in time. It worked in 2005 just fine but this problem has persisted for the last 3 years. Am I importing wrong? I point to Etrade, enter account sign-in info and TurboTax does the rest, so NO.But I'll still do it to save money and efile early. I wish they could fix these problems as the rest of the product is top notch and very easy and accessible.The problem COULD be with Etrade but I double checked their tax records online and I can clearly see the gain/loss listed in the data.</review>

<review id="7788">I purchased one of these to use with my MacBook for backup.  When It didn't work I thought it was just because it was meant for Windows.  So I decided to connect it to my PC.  I got the same result.  The light on the front would just pulse and the computer wouldn't recognize the drive.  I decided to take it apart because I thought I could make it work if I could figure out what was wrong with it.  I have purchased many external hard drives before and even had one not work correctly before.  The case was very difficult to get into and quickly I could see that I wasn't going to be able to put it back together.  I managed to take off the casing thinking I could just use the hard drive inside and put it in a different enclosure.  After all it was supposed to be 1.5 TB.What I found under all the casing was a shock to me.  It was an old IBM hard drive from May 2000 not the 1.5 TB I was expecting to find, rather it was a 10 GB drive that looked like it was pulled out of a junk yard, dusty and old.I always thought that Seagate had high quality products.  Now I am not so sure and I doubt that I will ever buy another Seagate product.</review>

<review id="7789">I upgraded to QB2009 Pro from QB2006 Pro.  QB2006 provided a means to download and automatically enter bank information.  I get several bank deposits from my credit card company every day.  Under QB2006, this was automatically entered in about 20 seconds, using the "Add Multiple" button in the Bank Download.  Under QB2009, I must manually enter all the data for payee, account and amount.  One cannot enter the class, and must exit the download, then select each new transaction and edit it to change the class.  This is a horrible HORRIBLE waste of time.  The poor software design of this "new" feature overwhelms all the other potential benefits of the new features they implemented in QB2009.  Watch out!  Intuit's sales blurb claims that QB2009 improves the download automation.  That is complete baloney.Quickbooks User Community says this is the #1 issue on tech support, but Intuit has still not addressed the User Forum to acknowledge the defect or indicate when it might be fixed.My advice is DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE UNTIL THE BANK TRANSACTION DOWNLOAD AUTOMATION is fixed.  I am returning the software for credit and will end up buying QB2008.</review>

<review id="7790">My first KA was the 5 qt stand mixer. I used it 20 yrs - and gave it away. I replaced it with the KP26 mixer, their biggest and best. The accessories don't work (cut) like the old atch did, the machine is a monstrosity that takes too much counter space, and everything I've prepped on it so far - something has gone wrong. I got an unbelievable price via Amazon promotion, but it's just too big for my kitchen. My first use involved the veggie shredder and it felt like the shaft of the shredder was bending as I applied pressure to the potato.  This gave an impression I was forcing improperly, but fact is- on first use this shredder would barely cut a potato; my first shredder (yrs ago) went through potatoes like a hot knife through soft butter.Make sure you need a model this large before you buy it.</review>

<review id="7795">Router's performance is  acceptable. Signal strengh subsides significantly (from excellent to low) within small distance (30 ft) but probably because of the walls etc.Connection speed is adequate. Configuration is excellent.

Once the router (in two months after the router was configured) lost its settings and reconfiguration was required (it takes 2 minutes).Two stars is because Netgear's customer service is BAD and unfriendly. ...</review>

<review id="7797">I needed a wireless router asap, so I went to wal-mart (sorry amazon) and this is all they had. I knew linksys quality has gone down the tubes over the years, and i hesitated to buy this. However, I needed a router that very day though so this was the only choice. I've set up many wireless networks in the past for friends and family (mostly using early WRT54G's, which were great pre v5) however I've never personally used a wirless network in my own home so I wasn't quite sure what to expect performance wise. Setup was easy as always using the web interface. I was excited to see my computer connect at 100+ Mbit from down the hall. However that was short lived as I soon realized I was actually getting barely 20Mbit...Well.. the horror stories are true. Linksys really cannot program for the newer routers very well at all. It worked great for the first few days, however when I went to copy some very large files between my computer (on wireless) and the computer in the office (on wired LAN) it would fail randomly as my computer started disconnecting and reconnecting randomly. These files were about 5GB and over the paltry ~20Mbit connection it was painfully slow and I almost cried when it failed at about 80%.I tried many settings. I had been using WPA2 and SSL for setup, and I thought maybe that was just too much for this thing to handle. However no amount of fiddling would solidify the connection. The most stable settings were to use G-Only, 20Mhz band, and no encryption, but that was just unacceptable to me for such an expensive device. Also the device becomes fairly hot during heavy use.THEN I DISCOVERED DD-WRT. HOORAY! I didn't think you could put custom firmware on newer linksys devices (it's been a while since I've set up a network). Man am I glad DD-WRT exists. I now have a rock solid device, consistently get 1ms pings from anywhere in the house, and haven't dropped a connection yet. Not to mention I can now use VPN, UPnP, advanced QoS, etc etc.. Upping the transmitter power to 70mv (from the default 28!) now gets me a signal almost a block and a half away! Now if i could just get up the Tx power on my usb adapter and iphone.. :)Not only that, but the thing runs cooler now even with the more than 2x power put into the antenna on the new firmware.A note about speeds: First, I am using a WUSB100 adapter. As I said with the stock firmware I would get about 20mbit from my bedroom to the office. I have no doors in my house so there is almost a line of sight between the two devices. The WUSB100 would always report about 135Mbit (yeah right lol!). This was with a 40Mhz channel in mixed mode. Now with DD-WRT I get about 30Mbit and its rock solid stable. The WUSB100 now reports I connect at 65Mbit.. Not too bad I guess. However there is no support in DD-WRT for wide channel on this device, I would be curious to see what performance would be with that enabled if it were possible. Also I am using SSL for the web interface and WPA2 again, and the CPU load on the router barely goes above 20% in most cases.So I give this hardware 5 stars. However I'm rating it a 1 star because out of the box this thing is basically an expensive paperweight. Plus you have to know what your doing and risk bricking the thing to get it to perform as advertised.Also note that I am a VERY heavy network user. I use a lot of P2P, video streaming (to xbox on the LAN), copying massive files around, full HD backups, etc. My problems may not be the case for the average home user.</review>

<review id="7798">Okay, I've been through most of the reviews for Breaking Dawn to find that a lot of people have had the same qualms about the book as I have. Some people have also loved it, but everyone's entitled to their own opinion.  Well, here's mine:(And as a warning, there's spoilers included.)In the beginning I had already found myself bemused by the behavior of Bella. I never understood how one character could do a complete three-sixty in a series of novels. Not only does she snap out of her meek phase, but she suddenly has a wild libido.  Okay, she's a teenager with raging hormones, I get it...but out of no where? I just didn't like it.       Next, how can a vampire conceive a child? Stephenie Meyer made it clear that "women" vampires couldn't have children, we're all fully aware of that, but why doesn't this rule carry over to the men?  If they're dead, what makes it possible for their bodies to still (and excuse the crude, biological references up ahead) create enough sperm to impregnate a living woman? And if they did, wouldn't those little guys be a bit decrepit to swim all that way? The man's dead after all.     But I got over that, somewhat, and went into Jacob's book with about as much enthusiasm as a snail in a salt bed.  I hated Jacob for the longest while, but in this one, I was pleased with him.  He was the only thing I was pleased with actually.  I hated Rosalie for not caring much about Bella, I hated Bella for being a complete idiot as her condition disturbed Edward beyond his wits, and as the baby pummeled her from the inside out.  Jacob was the only one that seemed to have a little bit of sense, until of course, he imprinted on Nessie.     Cute. And somewhat disturbing. And perfect, when you look at it hard enough.  Why should Jacob get left out of the loop, after all? Edward gets Bella.  Jacob gets mini-Bella.  That's a happy ending for you.  I didn't like that.                   (Don't worry, I'm almost done here.)     Lastly, the Volturi.  Why does their added bone in all the fun-loving, happy-happy not surprise me?  I mean, there had to be a pinch in the novel.  Conflicts are necessary.  Truthfully, I would have rather seen Bella die a horrible death than have the Volturi come all the way from Italy for nothing.  The intensity and suspense of a large fight resorts to an anti-climax that leaves you ready to rip out the final pages.     I give it two stars because the first two books were relatively enjoyable.  Once Bella becomes a vampire, without any circumstances whatsoever (everything's all nice and bow-tied in this fantasy world), the book goes downhill rapidly.              Thank you, Stephenie Meyer for boring me to tears.</review>

<review id="7799">I and my neighbor, who clued me in to the situation, were going to buy copies again this year until we saw the gouging intended by Intuit.  The fact that Intuit has backed off after loyal users screamed bloody murder doesn't change the fact that Intuit intentionally tried to get away with it.  I've used TurboTax for longer than I can remember, but no more.  I've ordered TaxCut and so has my neighbor.  Miserable business ethics, Intuit.</review>

<review id="7800">This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)      Wow, I must say that I have not been as disappointed in any movie in a long, long time. Considering I love the all star cast and the number of people that told me "IT WAS HILARIOUS!", and I did like the trailors I saw, I was expecting a great movie. And if not great, at least funny.Aside from a brief laugh in the beginning, I spent the bulk of the movie trying very hard to not stop it and kept telling myself "give it time and it will get better". It never did. I wont go in to the plot or anything else, other then to say, I was 100% disappointed and you could not pay me to watch this again...Loved the cast..but the movie simply stunk. Save your money...This is not worth $1 at a garage sale. I know others like it as many told me it was hilarious and I would love it....but as I said, it simply stunk in my opinion.If AMZN would allow a ZERO star rating, I would give this ZERO stars. I would almost prefer to go scoop the poop out of the yard then to have to watch this again.They took an all star cast that I felt would be impossible to "miss" with yet did just that. How can stiller and black not be funny? Especially on the same set? Add in Downey and Nolte and Tom Cruise with that "funny look" and how could this be so bad? I dont know, but it is literally one of the worst movies I have ever seen.....</review>

<review id="7802">This happens whenever you are trying to save bucks. I used a Dlink Wireless G before, owned by somebody else, manual setup was easy for that one, I used to have a linksys for myself, which really sucks as it continuosly stalls and has to be turned off. So I decided to buy this D-Link Wi- N, but it's midnight and I regret that decision. 1st It has a setup wizard which is a dumb wizard for saying, then the item was repacked though I bought it as new item , It even had the name of the last owner written down on the CD envelope "Montgomery Family Network" I can imagine these guys at the store or somewhere trying to figure out why was it returned, as it turns on perfectly and you can also log into the router with no trouble at all. But they did not plug it to a modem and surfed right, there is no time for that, so wrap it again and let another stubborn waste his time, I spent all the afternoon trying to set it up in various ways. I set up networks more than once in a while, I am usually the Mr "please set up my router guy" and that was what kept me stubborn on trying to bring to life this junkpiece. The reset procedure worked 2-3 times, now its kinda bricked, I even tried the master reset, now its really a 70 bucks brick, as D link does not tell u which ip to set when u do a general reset which i found by the way, 192.168.0.100 but this takes you no farther. I rather save time and spend some more money. gonna try 3 com or something with more prestige. Even beklin or that crap.</review>

<review id="7803">I've read "Breaking Dawn" twice, trying to get a handle on exactly how I felt about it and what I wanted to say.  It surprised me that it was so difficult, not because I've ever been an uber-fan of the series - I've enjoyed it, and I was looking forward to "Breaking Dawn," but I've haven't lived and breathed the series like some - but because this book honestly left me that confused.There have been many comments about the editing, and I agree with those.  The book reads like a first draft from a new author, which I found distracting.  Then I learned that Meyer had written a manuscript after writing "Twilight" and had borrowed from it liberally in the creating of "Breaking Dawn," and it made sense to me that the writing wouldn't seem nearly as polished; writers tend to improve the more they write, so if this had indeed been written early in her career, naturally it wouldn't be as skilled as if it was fresh.  Even so, why then go back and reuse a work she had to know wasn't up to the most recent standards she had set for herself?  Or if she really wanted to use that material, why not rewrite it in the style she's developed since?  I would think that if she had gone through and reread it knowing what she knows now about the craft, the "voice" would sound just as off to her as it does to the public - even more so to her, now that she knows what she's capable of creating.My bigger struggle was with the story itself and what to say about it.  I think that if "Breaking Dawn" had been released as a stand-alone novel, or even as the first book in a new series, it could work - change the names from the "Twilight" cast to something new, tighten up in a few places, and there you go - I truly think it could fly.  But that's the problem.  This wasn't presented as a stand-alone or as the start of a new series - it was presented as the final book in an already-existing, already-popular saga so that the readers who had come to love these characters and were dying to know how everything turned out would supposedly go on one last joyride with them.  And as such, "Breaking Dawn" just doesn't fit, because the readers were set up with the premise that it would and were - rightfully so - *expecting*.  Reading it under that auspice is like getting hit in the face with ice-cold water.  It's so completely different from anything and everything else that Meyer had set forth in the first three books - characterization, guidelines for her fantasy world, even just the feel of the setting itself.  None of it has carried through into "Breaking Dawn."  Again, if she really has used earlier work that was done before the whole "Twilight" world was really developed in detail, why didn't she rework this one to include any of that?My disappointment has nothing to do with the plot of "Breaking Dawn" itself - it has to do with the fact that I feel readers were rather mislead regarding what they could expect.  The fact that this is an old, recycled novel that never made it through the initial editing process shows plainly, and for me, it's destroyed her credibility.  I don't feel the public was given a finale to an established series, either construction-wise or creative-wise, and that's a let-down.  That's what readers were promised, and Meyer has failed to deliver.</review>

<review id="7810">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      Summary:An excruciatingly unrealistic story makes you want to beat yourself unconscious with a lead pipe.  BUT, by far some of the best graphical animation there has ever been.  Worth watching to see these stunning graphics.  Expect good humor, and don't read too much into the story-it seems to be written by only romantic nationalist 20 year olds-a VERY skewed perspective.  The graphical animation, action, and humor still make this a fairly entertaining action movie.Why I love this movie:1. Graphics:  Duh!  All of these Marvel comic-turned-movies have absolutely stunning graphical animation.  'Transformers' is no exception.  In fact, I think this movie has the best graphic animation I've ever seen in any movie EVER!  VERY realistic!2. Humor:  Good natured humor that all audiences may enjoy.  There is a resemblance to cable sitcom humor, of which I am a fan of certain particulars.  This helps to accent the action in this movie.3. Sound:  Very well done sound effects.  Match the graphic animation well.  Really pulls the audience into the action.4. Action:  Entertaining suspensful action throughout the movie.  Pumped full of missles, guns, and cannons!  This is where the heavy entertainment value is in this movie.Why I hate this movie:1. Story:  Absolutely unrealistic; just shameful!  I love fiction stories, but the fictional world has to be realistic too!  Your classic waste-of-time unrealistic hero-always-wins elements are all too obvious in this movie.  These are the moments in movies that you're on the edge of your seat in anticipation, and the enemies, seemingly suddenly struck by a moment of utter stupidity, do not act like you would expect a villain to, thus allowing the hero to win.  Example: A villain who fires RAZORBLADES decides instead to chase the weak hero character and wrestle with him to make things more dramatic.  WHAT?  Wouldn't a real villain just fire the razorblades and eliminate the hero right away?  GET REAL MARVEL... shame!  All the benefits of this movie are absolutely damaged because of this.</review>

<review id="7811">I read the entire book, spent a good deal of time working with it.  The functions don't work at all.  Only the digital scale works and it is questionable.  I can notice a 2-4 pound range on the same floor surface over a 5 minute period.  This is junk.  I give up and I'll never buy another one of these again, it was a complete waste of time.</review>

<review id="7813">Hurricane Ike fried my Microsoft router so I had to get a new one.  I was advised to go with Netgear, but after reading the reviews on Amazon, and the pricing, I decided to go with Linksys.  What a mistake.  It took over an hour to set it up.  My son did the work, but he said it was just ridiculous the amount of hassle with the installation and setup.  I should have gone with Netgear.  It is working fine now that it's set up.</review>

<review id="7814">I can swaddle my baby in a receiving blanket much better and tighter than with this particular swaddler.  It's just not snug enough.  My daughter at just a few weeks old could pop an arm out within minutes.  I registered for (and received) 2 of these and i have not used them more than the first attempt.  I received another swaddler however, from the hospital gift shop that is made from a thin cotton material (like a t-shirt) with a really long wrapping end and it is wonderful!!!!  My daughter (who is now 3 months old) actually smiles when I start to wrap her into it.  It is so efficient that I can wrap her at bedtime and she's still snugged into it 7 hours later when she wakes up and she's still smiling. I regretfully do not know the brand of this snuggler but please shop around for it b/f buying this one.</review>

<review id="7815">The most infuriating feeling in the world is to dive headfirst into a book, expecting to love it, and then leaving the book behind feeling as though you could have skipped it altogether and not been any worse for wear. And that, sadly, is how I felt about "Eclipse."  I'll skip the summarizing (bloodthirsty newborn vampires recruited to hunt for Bella and Co., the return of Jacob Black, Bella's so-called romantic dilemma) and start right off with how I felt as I read more about these characters I came to know in "Twilight" and "New Moon." This may be redundant, seeing as so many reviewers have said it already, but I think we've lost Edward. Seriously. He's turned into the nightmare of all boyfriends, and not because he can't control his vampiristic urges to suck out Bella's life force - quite the opposite. Instead, he's gotten so protective, so stalker-ish, so controlling; that he seems almost HUMAN. TOO human, for a guy who rips one of his kind to pieces not long after telling his girlfriend he more or less believes that having pre-marital sex would damn his soul (Stephenie Meyer has said that she and Edward share the same fundamental beliefs, and in this sense I believe she was using him as a mouthpiece to voice her opinion that even teenagers their age -- 17 and near-19 -- should stay away from the horizontal macarena). Edward no longer possesses the same smart-mouthed, elusive, not-quite-arrogant-but-getting-there air that we were introduced to in the beginning. He's gotten overly gushy. His omnipresence in Bella's everyday existence has crossed the border over to supremely annoying. Combined with Meyer's repetitive descriptions of his tragic good looks, and you have the potential to piss off many readers who are looking for more depth in their heroines than internal narratives which read along the lines of: "IF HE LEAVES ME, I'LL DIE", and "I lost my train of thought as I stared into his smoldering topaz eyes."  Really, Bella? Has he got you that stoned (there's a comparison late in the novel: Jacob Black is her sun, Edward is her drug) that even when he disassembles your car so you'll stay away from your best friend the werewolf, it's easy to forgive him?  Bella's personality is totally warped in this installment of the series. I can't believe she's actually REGRESSING back into a spoiled, bratty, narrow-minded child. It's even more difficult to believe that she sees herself as being more mature than her mother, who has the good sense to point out the obsessive oddity of her relationship with Edward. The final straw, for me, was her resistance to marry him. Come on. You're planning on becoming one of the undead so that you can spend eternity with the guy. At least pretend to be jazzed when he offers to make an honest woman out of you.  When she punched Jacob - who gets a bad wrap for being persistent, though in my opinion he's not nearly as obnoxious as his rival Edward - I felt gratified, not for her but because she ended up breaking her knucklesin the process. People will say he's the manipulative one, but I believe he's a better person all-around than Bella's other boy-toy. He's warmer, less stifling, and he allows Bella to participate in events that Edward would consider to be dangerous. Still, as good as he was, the whole love triangle deal felt a bit contrived. And it makes the concept of "true love" between Bella and Edward seem sullied, especially by the end.   The best thing about "Eclipse" is that it shows Bella experiencing major doubts about leaving her human life behind. It's kind of incongrous with her childish attitude for her to be so preoccupied with consequences, but it fits the thoughtful nature she is supposed to have.My hope for "Breaking Dawn" is that Stephenie will give us back the characters we were expecting this time around. Also, that Bella will make the choice that's best for herself and finalize her story in the appropriate manner. Make us CARE where she ends up.</review>

<review id="7816">Well, it all started ok, but ended very badly for my WUSB600N. First thing I did was install the drivers and Linksys Connection Manager. Then I used the WPS wifi protected setup built into my router WNR834B v.2 and the Linksys software which almost worked as it found the router and connected, but could never obtain an ip address from the router. So then I used windows zero config and was able to get a connection and it worked until I switched beck to the Linksys software. I now call a connection manager the connection mangler because every time I tried to connect to my NETGEAR RangeMax NEXT Wireless-N router with the Linksys software it locks all further communication with the 600N and I have to reboot and use windows wireless network zero-config utility. This device has also caused my Dell Precision M90 with XP SP2 to blue screen three times. My Dell came with a Dell wireless g card built in and I am back to using that to write this review. I hope Linksys realizes that they are starting to get a reputation of making some bad products. If Cisco is involved with this company then they need to bring more product verification back to Linksys to improve customer satisfaction.BTW: this device seem like it will break easily, however mine did not break but it does flex at the USB connection way to easily so if you are brave and want to by this device then be aware to use the supplied base and do not plug directly into a Mobile device such as a laptop. My 600N also came with a wonderful rattle of loose solder inside the device so again beware Linksys WUSB600N.</review>

<review id="7817">I was looking forward to an update to an old nose hair trimmer when I ordered this.  I was greatly disappointed by the cutting ability - or lack thereof - of this product.

<review id="7818">I have to say, after the first amazing, addictive books in this "saga" I feel SO let down by this one.  SM really dropped the ball.  It felt forced and one dimentional next to the rest of them.  It was tied up WAY too neatly, I should have expected it when the last chapter was called "Happily Ever After".  While reading it I got the feeling she just wanted to get it over with.  I feel like this book goes against alot of the rules SM set for herself in this world she created.  Her characterization was not even close to wonderful job she did with previous books.  And I cant say that I like the message of the book.  Get married, skip out on college, no work ever, sex all the time and dont worry about having a baby they arent much work they pretty much take care of themselves and if not someone else will take care of it for you.  Responsibility, whats that?  I expected a little of this just because they were getting married while Bella was so young but it all went too far!  Another complaint, there is some seriously creepy stuff going on with all the baby imprinting.  Im sorry but its just weird to "be" with someone that you changed diapers for when they were young.  And whats up with the whole "Jazz" thing anyway? You cant give someone a nickname 4 books in! :)In the end it didnt feel like SM wrote it at all, at times I was left seriously wondering if it wasnt a bunch of cut and paste fan fictions all slapped together to make a quick book.  Here's hoping that this is the only SM disappointment, you cant be great all the time I suppose, especially on a deadline.  She's such a promising writer, I still look forward to the future.</review>

<review id="7819">I bought this item and had to return it.  It is not worth buying a non-standard device.  I already have a wireless set up running through my house using the Linksys BEFW11S4, and it worked just fine.I decided to try out the new Linksys WRT54G.  Without the standard being set for the "g", 3 of the 4 wireless "b" cards that I have did not work with this unit.  My linksys wireless bridge (which connects my XBOX to the internet) did not work either.  I also bought a linksys "g" card that worked, but that set me back another $100.  I suggest if you already have a wireless network set up, stick with it.  Or if you are wired, stay wired until summer, when the IEEE and FCC settles on the standards of "g".  Prices will surely go down when it does get standardized, and products should hopefully work better. But for now, I will stick to what works and wait for the "g" to get better.</review>

<review id="7820">I ordered the unit after reading the many favorable comments.  Unfortunately, when I received it, the lid did not fit the pot tightly - it was rocking more than my chair.

Amazon accepted the return and will not replace with like item until the Quality has been worked out.</review>

<review id="7825">I recently decided to move from Windows to the Mac.. A move I'm glad I made.. But Moving to Quicken For Mac is a move I regret. For Years I've been using MS Money on Windows.. When I moved to the Mac I wanted to have a native app to use for managing my finances. I thought Quicken would be a good choice.. Boy was I wrong.. Quicken says that it was designed for the Mac, by Mac Users.. I would like to know what users they are talking to.. The interface is horrible, nothing like all the other well thought out and designed applications I have on my Mac. The software is buggy, slow, and the automatic downloading from my Banks isn't working. I've started using VMware Fusion to run MS Money.. It's not native, but Quicken Mac is so horrible there isn't much else I can do.. If you just switched to the Mac, or are planning to.. Save yourself the hassle and just get VMware or Parallels and run your old Windows app of choice for now.. Sadly it's a better option then this product.</review>

<review id="7827">These diapers are great on intent but still harsh in design. Feels a bit like wrapping a recycled paper towel on the baby and can't imagine it's all the comfortable.

They do hold well and haven't had any problems with leaking.</review>

<review id="7828">I've been a TurboTax user for many years and I thought I'd save a few bucks and try TaxCut for 2009. I am disappointed for two main reasons:1. Although TaxCut does import data from Quicken and such, it does not import your tax data directly from your financial institution. It is a real pain to input multiple stock sales and the like. I much prefer TurboTax in it's ability to download your data directly from your bank.2. Like TurboTax, TaxCut does have a main directory with each step listed, however TaxCut doesn't let you know which parts you have completed and which ones you need to visit. I love that feature on TurboTax because I often spread my tax prep over several weeks and input my data as I receive it via mail. I would have liked to see TaxCut include this simple feature.All in all, spend the extra money and get TurboTax. I know I will for 2010!</review>

<review id="7829">Perhaps I am unusually clumsy in the mornings but I used this grinder for only a couple of months before the base of the bean container snapped.  I ordered another one.  I've been unable to unjam the grinder from the position it was in when the first basket failed.  I read several reviews mentioning an issue with the design so tried to be extra careful when cleaning the grinder.  While it worked I thought it did a fine job.  The design is unforgiving of user error and I have gone back to my old burr grinder.  This isn't one for old ladies with arthritis who love good coffee.</review>

<review id="7830">I was hoping to eliminate some small appliances, but instead I have acquired a plethora af small pieces and one power base that sits on the counter.  To boot, the chopping blade was ruined the second time I used it.  On both occasions, the rubber gasket that seals the unit while in use, came loose.  The second time I used it (and I was following directions), the blade got stuck on the "locked-on" position (easier to do than you might think and the manual warns you against!) and the gasket became wrapped around the blade and chewed up the plastic.  A real mess.  I'm truly disappointed with this product and couldn't recommend it with a good conscience.</review>

<review id="7838">After having this product about 1 week i dropped it from approximately 10 inches.  I dented the weak "titanium" microscreen and had to order new ones at 30 dollars a piece.  I soon realized that I was running out of charge extremely fast and noticed that when i was plugging the unit in it was not charging (completely separate and unrelated to the 10 inch drop).  I would have to wiggle the charging plug back and forth several times before the charging light would come on.  Eventually after about 2 months this razor refused to charge and to the trash it went.  A month later my Remington haircutter also died, NOT IMPRESSSED.  I've had my less powerful Norelco electric razor for over 6 years and I've never had a problem.  Also the rubberized outside button is very cheap and could easily get torn or ripped, as for the "titanium" finish on the outside its just a cheap paint job. OVERALL i think im done with remington.</review>

<review id="7839">I've owned iPods for about 5 years now...and this one (4th generation Nano) is by far the worse.I'd estimate battery life to be about 1/2 of what the 3rd generation was.Also...be prepared to buy new docking products. Both my vehicles have iPod ready head units...and I have an iPod docking station in the garage. The 4th generation Nano will not charge from ANY of them. My previous iPods have worked just fine.This Nano also inexplicably jumps playlists. At first I thought I was bumping one of the buttons...but it does it while it's "locked" as well.I ended up trading this one to the person I sold my 3rd generation to. I'd rather deal with lower storage.</review>

<review id="7840">To read all the 5 star reviews will give you a skewed impression. This machine makes average to poor ice cream. After two attempts at chocolate ice cream - the simple kind that tasted like Nesquick [although you use quality powered chocolate] and the more sophisticated custard based chocolate which no one would eat because it looked and tasted like chocolate glop - I packed it away.My guess is that this is just another time when you [and all your guests] pretend home-made is better when it plainly isn't.It may also be noisier than other posters have mentioned. I put mine in the garage after two minutes of deafening decibels to run the cycle which isn't particularly convenient. Of course, it now lives in the garage. In its box.My advice: quality store-bought ice cream is: cheaper, better and quieter!</review>

<review id="7845">I bought this grinder after owning a $20 blade grinder for some time.  I read some of the other reviews, and I wholeheartedly disagree with some of the observations: The grounds from the Capresso didn't "jump out" when I was through, they neatly collected at the bottom of the plastic container.  The grounds left little mess at the top burr.  Anyone whose upper plastic bin broke off didn't follow instructions.  A third grader would understand the concept of lining the dots up.I rate this two stars because the coffee was horrible.  I chose the coarsest grind and ran it through a French Press like I always did with the blade-ground grounds - and:(1) after grinding, the grounds looked no more consistent than that from my $20 blade grinder, (2) there was the same amount of grounds that got through the FP filter, if not more, (3) there was at least the same amount of black sludge at the bottom of my coffee cup after pouring, and most important, the only reason I bought this, (4) the resultant coffee tasted weak.Now maybe I'm doing this all wrong.  I know there's a bunch of positive reviews for this product, even those that claim a great grind consistency, so either those reviewers are unaware that a $20 blade grinder is far superior to this product, or they are right and there's something I don't understand.  If so, I invite anyone who has had great success with this machine to comment on this review.  If I can get this thing to work, I'll delete this review and rewrite one with more stars.  Until then I really wouldn't recommend this machine to anyone.</review>

<review id="7846">I normally have had good luck with Linksys products as I do a lot of home/small office networking setups as a sideline business.  However a client of mine went out and purchased the WRT54G ver 6 router without consulting me first.  What a nightmare.  Linksys has really cheapened the WRT54G and WRT54GS routers with less flash memory and less RAM and a new embedded operating system.Router acted flaky right out of the box.  Went into the web interface and discovered that the interface was in German.  Flashed the firmware to the latest revision thinking that would fix the language issue.  It did not.  Do a Google and you will see this is a known problem with the this version.So off to Big Box Mart to exchange the router with an identical one.  At least the replacement worked.  Web interface was in English as expected.  Using IE7 and discovered an issue with the web interface though.  Was not able to set up MAC address filtering as the interface would not refresh correctly.  Used another laptop with IE6 and was able to set up MAC address filtering.My advice:  Avoid the new WRT54G and WRT54GS routers like the plague.  Do yourself a favor and order the WRT54GL which has more flash and RAM memory and a stable embedded Linux for an operating system.</review>

<review id="7849">My only problem with this product is the PUMP! This is the second fountain I have bought in 6 months, and now the pump has quit working AGAIN. I clean the fountain out once a week, use filtered water, and take the pump apart periodically and clean it too, just like the manufacturer suggests to do and still the pump fails. In addition since it's been little over a month since I purchased it, I can't return it to Amazon.  I was looking into getting a Drinkwell fountain, but it appears they may use the same pump manufacturer as Petmate does, so getting a Drinkwell fountain may not be a better solution. Just needed to clarify something...The cats really do like this fountain to drink out of, which is the only reason I buy a new one once the old one finally dies. If only the pump was designed better and it kept the cats from playing in the toilet, it would be a great addition to any cat and small dog household.</review>

<review id="7851">I truly enjoyed "Twilight," and couldn't wait to read "New Moon" and "Eclipse." Unfortunately, the entire series is plodding steadily downhill.--I could really feel Bella's anguish in "New Moon," but she still couldn't believe Edward loved her after he rushed to commit suicide once he thought she was dead? All the long drawn out discussion of every flip and turn of everyone's emotions was a premonition of worse to come.--In "Eclipse," the discussion of who felt what when and why went on FOREVER. It was like the slumber party from hell. Since everyone (Bella, Edward, and Jacob) has ultimately good intentions, this made it particularly boring.--In "Twilight," Bella manages to escape the Cullens, makes some important decisions on her own, and demonstrates incredible courage (though she's ultimately rescued by her own personal pack of superheroes). She doesn't do much in "New Moon," but that was clearly a middle book designed to set up a big finale in the next. In "Eclipse," Bella's big moment comes when she picks up a rock...and then drops it. That's it, folks.--Given that Meyer is a Mormon, and clearly wanted this to be a chaste romance, I give her credit for coming up with inventive ways to stall any real physical intimacy between Bella and Edward. No sex because he might crush her; not even any french kissing because of those venom-covered teeth. But the gentlemanly vampire Edward, who has been stalled at the super-hormonal age of 17 for at least eighty years, has been saving himself for marriage? I find an eighty-year-old virgin less believeable than vampires.--Curiously, however, these books revolve around sex. Edward is every teenage girl's fantasy: a boy of otherworldly beauty falls in love with an average-looking girl and uses his superhuman powers to protect her from harm. Edward kisses Bella constantly and cuddles her for hours every night. Yet Edward refuses, nobly, to make any real physical demands, sparing Bella from the anguish of entering the scary world of adult sexuality. He even spares her from being the bad guy; he's the one insisting on limiting their intimacy. In "Twilight," I could feel Bella's fascination, but by the end of "Eclipse" I had heard reference to Edward's "cold lips" and "granite body" about a hundred too many times. Meyer keeps everything above the waist, but the natural implications of Edward's "granite body", "like Michelangelo's David," no less, had me laughing by the end of "Eclipse".</review>

<review id="7852">I have used other Cavalry drives with very good results, but this drive is the slowest drive I have seen in years.  Both the USB and the ESATA interface are about the same speed, so it must be in the mechanism. It is so bad I have chosen to use this drive just for back up since it cannot keep up with my normal usage pattern.  I would love to know why is is so slow, but I have not had time to research it.</review>

<review id="7853">My three year old is autistic and she has a huge problem biting her nails so I took a gander on these and decided to try them out.  I gave it a taste first and it reminded me of what finger nail polish would taste like but it was pretty bad.  My three year old at first didn't like the taste but a day later she became immune to it and it had no effect.  I am sure this product would work for some people just not for me or my daughter.  Nail biting is a habit for me and I never noticed the taste since it was such a habit I didn't think about when I did it.  I have found a new method in which I chew gum a lot but I can't chew all the time so my system is flawed.</review>

<review id="7854">I posted this on the single Word review but thought it to be important to put here as well.The user interface for Microsoft's Office 2007 is horrible. I had it installed at work thinking I had an upgrade. From the confusing and unintuitive user interface to formulas that don't work there is no way that I can recommend this for business professionals. Stay with 2003 or get Open Office unless you like pretty pictures.</review>

<review id="7855">I bought this thinking I'd have a good all-around shaver and it certainly wasn't that. It can't do much more than a centimeter's worth of hair length on your head before it starts bunching up and cutting nothing. The plastic guards are a pain to put on and take off, are inconsistent and frequently PULL the hair straight out of your beard.....not pleasant. The hair on my back is rather fine and stays pretty close to the skin and the shaver did little to get it all.I guess I shouldn't have expected as much as I did but with a name like "Bodygroom", I would think it would work on more of your body. I can't even imagine how angry I'd be if I had used those crummy, hair pulling guards below the belt.</review>

<review id="7857">not a lot to like here. as others have pointed out, there's no level indicator, it's hard to even pour the water into the crevice provided. But the worst part is the carafe is too large for the  hopper. if you follow the included instructions you can only brew 7.5 cups of good coffee. Even our 10-cup Krups had a larger hopper that wouldn't overflow. But this thing takes up more space has a larger carafe but makes less coffee?  And yes, you open the lid and the condensation covers your counter.All of these seem bad this one very poorly designed, i researched these, and still i hate the shortcomeings of this one. Thought I could live with them, but this is just poor design, and i want to smash it everday. so look for better. This looks great great but is poorly designed, even the filter barely fits in the basket. AVOID. i may just return this.</review>

<review id="7859">This review is from: Quantum of Solace [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)      UGH!! I was SO disappointed! WHAT HAPPENED? Same writers who worked on Casino Royale (which is probably the best Bond film ever)... seemingly good director, but it just failed on so many levels. First, not Daniel Craig's fault. He's AWESOME. He makes the thing worth watching at all, but the script just wasn't great and it wasn't a great story to begin with. What's it missing? Well, the spine of a great story and good characters and scenes to ornament it. Casion Royale had it because it was based on IAN FLEMING's first and, arguably, best book (particuraly the 2nd half of the movie which follows the book and not the rather pedestrian first half which had Purvis and Wade's mediocrity-by-the-numbers-writing written all over it).Solace is a straight revenge "story" (using word lightly here) and oddly mirrors License to Kill. That was Timothy Dalton's 2nd and final Bond movie... which, while good, didn't really have a Bond feel... civilized high living world replaced by 3rd world, south of the border, with our secret agent out to kill the bad guy on the run from his own service. License did have a completed script at least.I think Solace starts with a great opening in Italy and ends with a good scene in Russia... both of which make you long for the film to have followed along those lines. But it doesn't. The rest of the film is just kind of boring, not suspenseful, no chemistry of character and only momentary flashes of good dialogue (thank you Paul Haggis, but not quite enough like Casino). Like everyone says (and is apparent from the moment the film begins), it's a straight steal of the Bourne movies in tone and style. That would have been okay had there been better writing. Everything gets less and less interesting, while you're hanging on hoping it will come together... but by the time Mathis enters (returns) in you're pretty bored. Mathis' whole presence induces sleep... time that should have been spent with story and character development of those already introduced (probably one of the women and Bond's relationship with them).  Other LOWLIGHTS: Title sequence which was done by the Director's "own crew." They say they love the 60s feel and From Russia With Love, but they made it 70s feel and no where near as good as all the recent title sequences by whoever that (talented) gentleman is. Coupled with the crappy title song (derivative, boring, pretentious... kind of like the director you say?), it serves as a warning for what the audience is about to see.That opera-thing scene where the director went "artistic" and did inter-cutting instead of staying with Craig, substituting suspense with PRETENTIOUSNESS. The final "showdown" with that 70s(!) style lair being blown up in pointless and again, yawn, suspense-less fashion. It's even hard to remember more about the movie...PRODUCERS: Fire Purvis and Wade, only use Haggis for dialogue. Get new, great writers (it's a BIG WORLD... they're out there!). You say you want new and great movies... well wait to you have a GREAT STORY and SCRIPT again!!! Then get a great director (I do like some of this guy's previous films too, but he just didn't work in this area- keep with that effort though). Personal plea: BEG John Barry to do another score! LISTEN to the title song before picking it (don't just go with White and Keys because they're supposedly cool). You cannot wait 3 years either... you have to make up for this!!!!! Craig won't be young forever!! GIVE HIM ANOTHER GREAT SCRIPT! YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN CASINO ROYALE, BUT YOU HAVE TO GO WITH STORYTELLING AND SUBSTANCE, NOT JUST STYLE AND TONE!!!</review>

<review id="7860">I love Stephenie Meyer's books.  She was one of my favorite authors and still ranks high on the list, but this book was not very good.  Just like The Host this book went on and on and on.  There could of been a lot less book and been good.  Plus, there were alot of things that came through in this book that she never mentions before.  Skip the first 400 pages and you get to the interesting part.  Sorry Stephenie, but not so good this time.</review>

<review id="7861">I LOVE Twilight. I'm one of those girls that everyone finds annoying because she listens to the podcasts, reads the books monthly, and had a countdown widget on her computer for the Breaking Dawn release party.Breaking Dawn was probably one of the biggest dissapointments of my teenage years. I knew, as well as understood, that not everything I wanted to happen would happen in this final installment. I was okay with that. What I was NOT okay with was the way Breaking Dawn was so unlike the previous three books in writing style, themes, dialogue, and characters that I honestly felt like I was reading a very creative, but bizarre fanfiction. The whole book just had an "off" feeling that I couldn't really place. I felt like the characters I had loved for so long were gone.The book starts off decentely. The I thought the wedding scene was done well, and I loved that Jacob showed up to see Bella once more. It all kinda goes downhill from there. The honeymoon was awkward. The concept of Isle Esme was ridiculous, and I honestly wondered why Edward took her to a sweltering hot island when Bella repeatedly states (in the previous three books) that she prefers her chilly Forks home to the beaches of Florida or the heat of Phoenix with Renee. As for the sex scenes, I really didn't expect anything really detailed, but after the steamy scenes from Eclipse, I was looking forward to a little description about Edward and Bella's first night of "trying". Then......Bella gets pregnant. WTF. Hasn't Stephenie stated repeatedly that vampire venom replaces ALL fluids in a vamp's body? How on earth did Edward's SPERM survive? Strike one steph. Once Bella gets pregnant, her relationship with Edward gets put on the backburner. Seriously, Edward becomes such a side character that I think that Carlisle had more lines than him by the end of the book. I thought the Twilight Saga was centered around the intense relationship between Edward and Bella? Not anymore folks. Stop at Eclipse if you want to read a romance novel.Bella becomes so "not-bella" after the pregnancy that it was hard to concenrate on her POV. Switching to Jacob's was refreshing, and his chapters were ultimately the most amusing and relateable. He was just as confused by the absurdity of the pregnancy and the change in everyone's characters (especially edward and bella's) as I was!I could go on forever, but the whole pregnancy thing seemed a cop-out so that Jacob could he his imprint yet stay close to bella forever. Bella didn't grow as a character or sacrifice anything in this book. She didn't have to give up edward, jacob, sex, children, relationships with her parents, or even a future at college since her first year as a newborn was so convienetely "easy" for her. Nobody dies. There isn't even a grand final battle. Everyone gets what they want and more. Life really can be perfect, right Steph?</review>

<review id="7863">This review is from: Changeling [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)      Warning to those with older Receivers. This Blu-ray disk only has a DTS audio soundtrack in English. If you have a Receiver, like I do, that only decodes Dolby Digital 5.1, there is no audio output.The rest of this review is for the clueless producers of this Blu-ray disk. Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come! I will rent this movie on DVD and wait for the audio wars to end. Since Blu-ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility. Particularly since Dolby 5.1 is already provided on this disk in other languages. From reading various blogs and reviews, I know I am not the only potential lost sale.</review>

<review id="7864">When I first reviewed the information about this hard drive, I compared it with the 500GB one,that is, Seagate FreeAgent 500 GB 3.5-Inch USB 2.0 Hard Drive ST305004FDA1E1-RK. I concluded that this one is much smaller that the latter one. My friend bought the ST305004FDA1E1-RK one and she said for sure that the 1tb one was much smaller in size. Unfortunately, when I opened it yesterday the moment it got here I got dissappointed! It's the same size of the ST305004FDA1E1-RK one, and what's more, it's heavier! I don't know whether it's because the description is misleading or some other reasons, I'm wondering if i can refund it?</review>

<review id="7865">My dad used turbotax for years and often has told me that it is a great product saves him tons of money since he had two kids in college with different income situations. I used it last year with no issues grant it I was only a resident of one state that year. This year I moved to another and was forced to spend 30 dollars plus the original fee for the software bringing my grand total to about $70 when all was said and done (this is before those lovely efile fees.) I go through my taxes and fill in my information and get to the point where I e file. The federal one was free (thank God) then I get to the screen for state filing, and intuit wants another 20 [..] a piece for each state. At this point I am annoyed with them and wonder why I spent the 30 dollars for my additional state when in the end I still got dinged the full efile price for both states. Intuit didn't need any fancy files for either of my states since I don't own a business or contract out. I know what some might say "well you should have known that moving would have made it more complicated etc. to file tax returns" or something to the effect of "well no one forced you to use turbotax" I take responsibility for all of it and I did eat the additional cost (still cheaper than going into an accounting shop to get it done and I didn't have to worry about some jerk stealing my information). Just be warned that if you are filing more than one state return this year you will have to pay an extra 30 [...]per additional state plus an efile fee for every state on your list. So in the end you get one free thing for dropping 39-59 dollars on this software. If they were upfront about the TOTAL cost for filing just one full return (ie one state and one federal return) it would have been a little easier to handle and would have allowed consumer's to shop around.</review>

<review id="7866">I went to von mauer today to test some scents.  the first one i asked for was acqua di gio.  i was so unimpressed. maybe it's because i've heard such rave reviews. this scent is unoriginal and extremely pretentious. i'd rather be caught wearing abercrombie fierce than this sludge. there are far more tasteful colognes out there to distinguish yourself from the rest.  alas, scents are personal and should be judged for yourself.  if you like this stuff, then go for it.</review>

<review id="7868">Now before I sound any more like a teenage girl, here's the bottom line. The Bodygroom is a waste of money. I have never written negative reviews for anything and it's a shame that Philips had to break that spell. I wish I had kept my receipt so I could return it, but being that I've never been disappointed by neither Philips or Norelco, I threw it out. I simply cannot understand the good reviews on this site. They must be somehow connected to the brilliant people that put out the ad campaign. Who knows. Back to the product: Looks nice and that's about it. It barely cuts anything, when it does, hair gets trapped between the blue plastic attachment which means that you constantly have to take it off and rinse it. That would sort of be ok, if the whole head (cutter blades) didn't come out as well. Even with the lightest touch, it still feels like you're breaking it and I'm sure one of these days it will surely do just that. Here's the worst part, even if advertised as working fine in the shower, it will hurt as hell, as your hair will get caught in it, so every 5 seconds you'll be going 'ouch' 'ouch' 'ouch' You get my point. So try it on dry hair - doesn't hurt as much but still doesn't cut. The design is itself very poor. If you look at the blades under the very fragile (sic!) foil, they're basically vertical semi-circle blades at a  moving left-right-left at a very fast speed. Well, they're not fast nor sharp enough. Again, it will catch your hair. And it will hurt. The attachments are also a joke. The numbers don't really correspond the ones at the barber's, but they go up to a 5!!! Now if I can't really cut medium length hair from my sensitive areas with a 1, what the hell am I gonna do with a 5? Surely this was meant for Geico's cavemen.I could go on and on. Do yourself a favor, keep the receipt, or even better spend $20 on a Conair trimmer that will cut 20 times better. This is just plainly bad. Really bad. And if any Philips people are reading this, I want my money back. Pretty please.</review>

<review id="7869">I bought the Ooma system as a Christmas present for my mother, hoping I could save her the high cost of phone service.  We were both disappointed.  Here's why:1.  Installation was easy enough, but the quality of the calls were such that the people I called complained.  One said that I sounded like I was calling from overseas with a vacuum cleaner running in the background.  She terminated the call after just a few minutes because it was so difficult to listen.2.  The Scout line was impossible.  The line was so filled with static that it was completely unusable.  The problem may have come about because of a conflict with the wiring in the house, but whatever the reason, the call quality was simply unacceptable.I'm very disappointed because all the great reviews led me to expect more. . . much more.  I have returned the Ooma . . . sadly.One star</review>

<review id="7871">I completely agree with "Returned it in favor of Hands Free Gate" by Brian.

It is nice that it is tall but to me, that is the only good thing about it!</review>

<review id="7872">I had this coffee maker for over a year and the lid was ALWAYS too difficult to untwist with your bare hands. I always had to use a towel or the rubber pad used to open cans. Many times I gave up and had to had my husband open it for me. The worst of it is, that is how it pours - you have to twist it to get your coffee out - no easy button to open the spout. We kept is so long because the coffee stays hot and delicious. However, life is just too short to keep an appliance that DAILY causes you strife. I wish I had returned it as it is quite pricey.</review>

<review id="7873">I've had problems with this router and also the BEFW11S4 router using encryption.  The current WRT54G router is version 1.1 and has the Cisco Systems logo.  Without encryption, the system works perfectly.  With encryption, you will have problems with DHCP, but you can connect to the router.  The router will drop your connect every couple of minutes at the minimum.  The only real "security" you have is to enable mac filtering to keep others out of your lan, but as for your transmissions, its not very secure.  I've had this problem with my Dell 1300 wireless card in my laptop, belkin USB wireless adapter and others.   Maybe some other wireless cards may work flawless, but I had very little success with linksys using encryption.  If you don't need security, this router will work great.  If you are worried about security, this router might not be ready yet.  Hopefully, future firmwares will make the router more stable, but the last firmware update was 4 months ago from Linksys. Don't hold your breath too long.  I've always like linksys's wired routers, but their wireless routers has been unreliable.  In terms of marketing, their previous router version 1.0 was marketed with simple port filtering.  Now their box claims the router is a SPI firewall.  I really don't know how true that is.</review>

<review id="7874">I didn't realize when I bought this trimmer that it was a manual trimmer and not battery powered.  You need to use both hands to operate the thing which I found rather awkward.

<review id="7876">I have had the WRT54G and a Linksys wirelass adapter for a year or so. I would not advise buying any Linksys product because the technical support is awful.Unless you are an expert, you will probably need help from tech support sooner or later. My experiences with tech support have been uniformly bad.I have a simple system, two Win XP computers, a router, and a wireless adapter.Yet, the support people seem unable to solve common problems. When they can't, the blame your ISP, modem, Windows, or whatever. There is no way to get connected to a higher level person.</review>

<review id="7877">So, I have owned this product for 2 months, and in those two months, the wireless has regularly cut out for no reason for about 4 to 6 seconds every 5 minutes or so.  This is enough of a timeout to cause ssh sessions to die and streaming video to halt.  So, I updated the firmware, changed the broadcast channel, altered the encryption.  None of that solved anything.  I tested the product on the floor 3 inches from my laptop...same problem.  I called linksys support, and they told me to raise it up a foot...why the wireless can't reach 3 inches, I don't know, but I did it, on a stack of books.  Problem persisted.   The tech support representative had no other useful information, telling me it was probably something environmental.  I highly doubt this to be the case, since I see this problem is quite frequent.  If you plan to use wireless, I truly can't recommend this product.</review>

<review id="7878">This thing does not work well with macs. It has caused many headaches. If freezes opened files, but you will not know this until you've done your work and you try to save it AHHHH!!!  I have two macs and it has the same problem. I tried it to my buddy's brand new mac and it froze the whole thing. It's no problem when you are dragging files in and out manually, the problem is when you open files within it using applications.If for some reason you do get one (FREE) drag the files into your desktop, use them and them drag them back in manually. After I plug this thing in the USB port it takes about one to two minutes for the MAC to recognize it.The only reason I give this thing two stars is because it works better with my windows based HP. For MAC users I recommend the cruzer by SkanDisk it works perfect on macs.</review>

<review id="7879">This product is very low end quality.  Mine broke in less than a week.  It would no longer count steps.  Overall, even if it managed to work longer than a week, the way that the interface works makes it fairly useless for going back and looking at prior walks as it is either difficult or impossible to get all of the data about the walks beyond the number of steps.Overall, I'd rate this product as not worth anything to a serious walker.  Nothing is worse the getting half way done with ones walk only to discover that the pedometer isn't recording anything.</review>

<review id="7880">As the other reviews mentioned, the router is easy to setup (with wizards and everything), and I've used D-Link in the past and have had great luck.Problems with this router:1.) Loses internet connection.  I'll have to login to the router via the web interface, and reboot the router to get the internet connection back up.2.) The wireless won't always give a DHCP address.  I ended up setting my computer to a static address to make sure I'd be able to get on with no problems.I hope D-Link comes out with a fix for it.. soon.UPDATE: D-Link came out with a firmware fix, and it has worked perfectly ever since.  It has turned out to be a flawless router.  My neighbors love it too!</review>

<review id="7881">turbotax would allow you to prepare multiple returns until this coming year, as other posters have complained, they increased their fee for the initial software or download then added a charge of $9.95 for each return printed or e-file (after the first return). they also allowed you to e-file up to 5 returns for a fee. taxcut has the same program for the coming taxyear 2008, for $49. keep in mind taxcut is a product of H & R BLOCK, the income tax people .</review>

<review id="7883">Stay away. This gate is badly designed, badly engineered, and impossible to operate easily. The fatal flaw: Instead of a one-time, "set it, forget it" width adjustment, you must re-adjust the width of the gate *EVERY SINGLE TIME* you open and close it, in order to mate/unmate the gate to the latch bracket on the wall. There's no earthly reason why anyone would want/need a non-portable, hardware mount gate to do this.To make matters worse, the wooden gate sections--which become much more flimsy when the gate is open--rack and bind together and make this adjustment impossible to do one-handed. No amount of tinkering on my part could resolve this issue.The very first time she tried it, my wife caught the skin of her wrist in one of the metal brackets on the top rail while shrinking the gate in order to open it. Please consider other better-designed options. Don't get lured in by the wood construction, as we did. If you just can't live with a metal gate, then either find a different one than this, or call a carpenter.If you get this as a baby shower gift, open it right away and see for yourself--don't set them aside for later, when you'll wish you could still return them.</review>

<review id="7884">After many hours of running around the house and plugging and un all the network devices, entering security keys or pushing buttons. I was able to get 5 out of 8 (yup large network 4 media type and 3 computers and 1 printer) to connect to the router properly. Just when I thought I was able to connect to the Internet, the router had to be power cycled and then only 2 or 3 devices would connect to the Internet. Left it over night but to start the day had to power cycle to use desktop and get email.The setup was quick, but it would seem some how not complete. I have been running the linksys WRT54GS for years and it has stopped working. It had no trouble with the XBOX 360, 2 wrt600n or any of the computers. The unit is being returned. I will have to find another router for my Home.</review>

<review id="7885">I've now had this fountain for a little over 2 months and the pump is starting to fail.As is, if I unplug it, to start it again I need to open up the pump and push the impeller to get it spinning. Without the initial push to get it running, it simply doesn't start.Also, do not think that this fountain will replace your water dish or be less of a hassle. In fact, this will require a tremendous amount of effort to keep running.Daily Maintenance:Clean out cat/dog hair from the mesh.Fill up.Every Other day:Clean the inside filter.Weekly:Take completely apart, wash out all gunk, hair, dirt etc.Open the pump, push the impeller to get it started.Oh and both the cats and dogs seem to prefer the old large water dish as opposed to the fountain, which they also use, but not nearly as much.</review>

<review id="7886">The original review below was written in mid May 2006.  Approx. June 5, several weeks after I expected a reply, I received a reply to my snail mail inquiry to Panasonic. The reply informed me how to return device. Tried Irrigator one more time before shipping it back to Panasonic, and the device worked. A plastic piece has dropped out of the resevoir, so I don't know how long the Irrigator will now work, but I am going to give it a try. When the Irrigator works, it is good value for the money, and seems to be effective.Written in Mid May 2006 While of good design, don't buy this product unless you can afford to discard the Irrigator if it breaks. I have wasted hours of my time trying to deal with Panasonic Customer service, far more time than is justified by a $35 device. The Oral Irrigator failed within 30 days of use, but I didn't get around to dealing with it until after the Amazon 30 day return period.The Panasonic website doesn't work, email to an address from the website is returned undelivered, phoning customer service means in indefinate hold, and if you finally do get someone, they are useless, and you may be summarily disconnected. Mail sent via USPS to Panasonic personal care division is not answered.  Phoning Panasonic's corporate offices in New Jersey is a worthless exercise. I have tried all of the above multiple times. And finally when Panasonic sends you an email, after multiple phone calls and prolongued discussion with Panasonic in New Jersey, the website to which you are referred by the email doesn't work. I have owned many Panasonic products, as they have been a preferred manufacturer for me. That has now changed.I suggest to Amazon that, if my experience is repeated more than once with other customers, Amazon consider not carrying any Panasonic Personal Care Products.</review>

The top is very difficult to open, it is VERY loud when brewing, and there are too many steps in preparing to brew compared to my old coffee maker (the Starbucks model which was recalled).  I actually liked the Starbucks model MUCH better.  Also, the gold filter basket recommended to purchace with this item does not fit!  I returned both items.</review>

<review id="7889">Just returned this product to Intuit Returns department and purchaesd Tax Cut instead.  I was a big Turbo Tax user (since early 90's - until now).  Turbo Tax is ever intrusive (each year it gets worse) and as a result loads extremely slow.  The program still bugs me to update everytime I load it after waiting what seems an eternity to open (even though I set it not to update on opening).  I hate the new menus as it is missing the quick little save icon.  The forms menu sucks big time - as it only lists form NUMBERS under the "all forms" option and you have to type in the search box the name of the form you are looking for if you want to find it.  Since I like to peruse all available forms with names, this is very annoying to me.  You do see a list on the left side of the window with "My forms" - forms tht pertain to your return --- which might be nice, but you can't close the darn list - you can only drag it to minimize the pane to about 1/2" - annoying again!  While dummying in some numbers, I was unable to override an entry that I wanted to see how it would affect my 1040.  I really truly hated this program from the get go - and have just now today become a Tax Cut customer!  Save some money - buy Tax Cut at Sams Club for just less than $42 and save at least $18 from Turbo Tax price for equivalent product.  Good riddance Turbo Tax!</review>

<review id="7890">A few things I wasn't expecting persuaded me to return this mouse and go back to the best mouse ever: the MX Revolution.1) The hyperfast scroll wheel DOES NOT include smart-shifting technology. In order to change between freewheeling and clicking, you must turn the mouse over and engage a switch. In my opinion, this defeats the entire purpose of the expensive wheel.2) The onboard memory does NOT retain ALL of your settings on all computers. When used on computers without setpoint, some features are not available, such as horizontal scrolling and zoom.3) The clunky feel of the mouse is not characteristic of Logitech. I did not find the mouse to be comfortable even with all the options.4) The cord is stiff! Thanks to a nicely gliding mouse and slick coating on the cord, when you let go of the mouse it may wander away. It also sticks up and gets in the way of everything.The only thing I really found as impressive as advertised is the DPI switching ability, which is super cool, but not worth keeping.</review>

<review id="7893">We have not found the Word 2007 version of this product easy to use.Six months ago, we purchased and installed this product on our computers ,removing the earlier version of the Microsoft office suite, with the firm belief that we now have a superior upgrade.Unfortunately, after two weeks of earnestly trying to learn and use this version we gave up, and removed it and reinstalled the older, friendlier version.Perhaps we will keep it on one computer, taking some time during the course of the year learning how to use this format and product design.So far, we have found the format to be quite different (ie. from the older version), cumbersome, and somewhat difficult to use.The Word 2007 version of this product is not user-friendly!Comment Comment | Permalink</review>

<review id="7896">I've been using Quicken Deluxe for about 6 years. I just upgraded to Quicken Deluxe 2009 and it 20 seconds to look at an account and 10 seconds to process any transaction which makes it basically unusable. After working with Quicken support for an hour and verifying the data file, support said that 2009 didn't support large data files well, they suggested I just delete all my old transactions every year and it would be much faster. Of course that defeats the whole purpose of using Quicken.My quicken data file has about 20MB of data and quicken 2007 used about 200MB of ram to open it. Quicken 2009 now uses about 1.2GB of ram to open the same file.</review>

<review id="7897">It was quite a struggle to go through my Excel assignment. And not because of its complexity. But because of the Microsoft Live OneCare anti-virus & firewall.While it was on, it would compromise collaboration features of Excel, besides bringing other havoc ! Only after a lot of hassle, like uninstalling the entire suit, I by chance run into the posting about apparent conflict of MS OneCare & ExcelI did have same problems with using certain features of QuickBooks software, but Intuit is Microsoft main competitor and it might not have much incentive to make its anti-virus software run with it. However it's inconceivable that the Microsoft's own anti-virus suit would be so incompatible with Microsoft's flagship application - Excel !The reason I've changed from MacAfee to One Care is for greater compatibility, but what did I got ? However that's nothing new about Microsoft' modus operandi, my Zune isn't compatible with Microsoft's own DDR Format either.It doesn't bring me joy to bash Microsoft, neither I am an Apple fanboy, but from what I am hearing from friends and family members who work at Microsoft, Microsoft is ruthless in criticizing its employees and automatically fire 10% of the bottom ranked employee, even if they do a satisfactory job.Apparently this "dog-eat-dog" corporate culture, in which employees are expected to work overtime, and often are brought to tears by blunt remarks of their stressed-out bosses, doesn't help produce interoperable, reasonably bug-free products, in a timely fashion.Perhaps adopting a more collegial, compassionate & less tense corporate culture would bring better results? Since employees who are treated with respect are much more likely to go an extra mile (like noticing & fixing bugs that they aren't responsible to notice & fix), than those who don't.</review>

<review id="7898">This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) [HD DVD] (HD DVD)      The thing I hate about Michael Bay movies is that the characters are always stereotypes. For example, every black character must say stupid things like "Damn" or "This s*** is crazy." Pile on top of that the fact that this movie is about an hour longer than anything based on Transformers should ever be. The fact that they tried to create a plot, but somehow the movie is plotless still baffles me.All in all, it's a Michael bay movie. Explosions over substance, overly tanned caricatures with zero motivations, a world basked in endless magic hour glow, and a story that makes you want to smack your head against a brick wall repeatedly.</review>

<review id="7899">After extensive searching for "just the right" joystick for Flight Simulator X, I settled on the PS27, mainly because of its Force Feedback feature.The first surprise came when I noticed the AC power supply packed in the box.  The manual states that "in order for your Operating System to recognize your joystick, please make sure it is plugged in before connecting the USB cord".  Once you have AC and you plug the PS27 into the computer, the setup is rather easy.  Windows XP recognizes the PS27 right away and installs the proper drivers for it.  The PS27 comes with its own driver CD, but the instructions state it is not necessary unless you want to install the optional programing software.I opened the Control Panel and opened the Joysticks to calibrate the PS27.  I found that everything worked except moving the joystick to the right.  It would not register.  I moved the joystick to all four axis, and after a couple of times doing this, it moved all the way to the right.  Throttle and rudder worked great.  Then, after a couple of seconds, the right would not register again.  I launched FS X and found that the same problem occured in the game.  Turning left - no problem.  Going up and down - no problem.  Turn right - problem.  Now, if my intent was to travel to the left during the entire game, this would have been fine.  But landing requires both directions, so I read the instructions some more.  I also found a separate sheet packed in box which apparently was left out of the manual.  The sheet said that the PS27 has "Dynamic Centering".  This means that it does not have auto-centering like most joysticks.  It suggests that before launching the game, you move the joystick all the way around a couple of times, move the throttle up and down and twist the handle a couple of times in each direction (rudder action) THEN launch the game.  It should be noted that this applied only to the PS27, which has Force Feedback.So I did this and then launched FS X again.  Same results as before - left, up, down, throttle, rudder, no problem.  Right, problem.  Now, the problem can be fixed from within FS X by moving the joystick all around during flight a couple of times.  It will then move to the right, but after a few seconds goes back to not turning right.  This is fine at 2000 feet, but when you get closer to the ground, it can cause issues, such as losing control of the aircraft.I updated the software and drivers from Saitek's site, repeated the process and came up with the same results.  It is my opinion that the joystick was deffective, however I don't know this for a fact.  The look, feel and features of the PS27 are great.  The Force Feedback can be turned off, which I did, but the results were the same.  Some adjustments can be made from within Control Panel, which are suggested by Saitek, but again, the results were the same.</review>

<review id="7900">I've lost count of the number of times I've reset this unit to factory defaults - then it's the roll of the dice whether or not the setup wizard will find the thing on my network.  When I've got everything configured, it will work great for awhile, but chances are that I'll have to spend an hour fooling with it before I can use it again.

<review id="7902">H&R Block TaxCut 2008 Premium Federal + State + e-fileTaxCut is fine for simple returns but it is NOT a worthy substitute for long-time TurboTax users who object to the extra charges they added temporarily for 2008.  For one thing, with TaxCut you can't save a pdf copy of a return for easy reference; you have to print all returns and that also eliminates searching for a particular item in a completed return.  For another, with TaxCut you can't import transactions from your broker, meaning you have to type every single transaction in manually.  That one alone is enough to male me go spend the money on TurboTax and take my loss on my misguided purchase of TaxCut. Hopefully I can warn a few others who might be tempted to switch that they should consider whether that is wise for their particular returns.</review>

<review id="7907">I've had my Cruzer since the 2GB was $50 retail (1-2 years ago) and it's almost functionless. I used it pretty heavily, but it's no excuse for such a simple product to become defective. The slide action of the usb drive is too loose after such extensive use so that now it won't "lock" when it gets to its extended position and the resistance of pushing it into a USB port is greater than the worn down piece of plastic holding it into its extended position, meaning inserting it (its ONLY function) is difficult. In a few months time, it could be rendered impossible to use.Let alone the software that's packaged on the drive is a huge pain. There are removal tools available on Sandisk's site, but the software itself is gimmicky at best. Sure, it's cool to have a virus scanner and Skype bootable from a flash drive, but I didn't buy a flash drive to boot things from it (although most programs will boot from one); I bought it to store files.The push up style of USB drives is flawed. After prolonged use, the drive stops locking in its extended position, making inserting it into USB ports fairly challenging. Capped thumb have their obvious drawbacks, which leaves swivel style like 4GB Swivel Pro Flash Drive USB 2.0 with Neckstrap as one of the few long-lasting options.</review>

<review id="7908">I received this bread machine as a Christmas gift.  Our old machine is 12 yrs old and the motor is starting to make funny noises, though it still runs, so my husband thought we needed a new one and chose this Panasonic based on several good reviews.I tried 4 different recipes in the book that came with it, to try out the different operating modes ... basic, whole wheat, pizza dough, and rapid.  The 3 that were baked were burned on the bottom half of the loaf and scorched on the bottom, even the 'basic' loaf which I ran on 'light crust'.  They came out hard and black.  The top half of the loaves were somewhat edible, though one (rapid) was actually uncooked in the center near the top.  The pizza dough came out OK but very wet, I had to add a lot more flour just to handle it while I kneaded and rolled it.  Once baked into a pizza, it tasted fine but not great.In all settings, there was a lot of flour left in the bottom corners of the baking pan, that did not get mixed into the dough.  During mixing, I had scraped down the sides, but apparently did not reach the unmixed stuff at the very bottom.  I don't know if this was the cause of the mixing problems, but the mixing paddle did not fit well onto the shaft.  The d-shaped hole in the paddle was quite a bit bigger than the d-shaped motor shaft, so there was a lot of 'play' before the shaft actually turned the paddle.  At certain points in the mixing cycle, the machine mixes in sort of a rapid 'pulse' fashion, which did not even move the paddle because of the poor fit.Overall I was very disappointed.  I was even more disappointed when I found out how much this machine cost.  My old machine was purchased at an after-Thanksgiving special sale for about $30 and it has been used regularly for 12 years!!  I see in others' reviews that no one makes a machine as good as the 'old ones' anymore ... perhaps this is true.  This Panasonic cost 4X the old one and didn't make it through 4 uses before showing its poor qualities.  I am returning this machine, going back to my old machine for as long as it keeps running, and will continue shopping for a good bread machine.One other thing that really bugged me about this Panasonic machine is that it is advertised, online and on the box, as having '3 crust settings -- light, med, dark'.  They don't tell you those settings are ONLY available in the Basic mode, which I rarely use.  I guess if you want a light crust on Whole Wheat, you could pull the bread out early, but that kind of negates the 'automatic' in Automatic Bread Maker.</review>

<review id="7911">This thing is pure junk.  It seems like it could be a useful product, except that it will not charge.  And we're not talking about the typical Apple planned obsolescence, in which the battery on your nifty new toy dies on purpose within six months.  It will not work right out of the box.  The problem is not the Firewire issue noted on Apple's website (which means your old ipod charger will not work on the itouch), because I purchased a new charger specifically for the device, and it still will not work.  This is the third ipod in a row I've had significant problems with. No more Apple for me, ever again.</review>

<review id="7912">I've owned 2 of these machines, and one of the original macbook pro 17s.  I've had nothing but grief...  When they are running, they run great, but it seems after a few hours they begin to slow down and hang.  Programs freeze, and sometimes can't be force quit.  Mail program is still buggy, and occasionally all of your messages are lost and need to be reloaded.  Crashes when waking up from sleep.  Seems to have mysterious invisible files clogging up the hard drive.  I bought this machine loaded with 4GB ram, high res screen, etc to replace my previous machine (which broke and had to go to apple care).  In the "old days" I could always get a couple of years of good service from a g3 or g4 laptop.  Now I am burning up 2 of these each year, and they are not fun to use with all of the crashing, freezing and lock ups.  What happened to apple?  They used to be a great company.  Now you have to pay $100 per year to be able to walk into a the store where you bought the machine and get service.  I've had it.  My next computer is going to be a PC...</review>

After approx 10-15 minutes, the signal is lost and I have to unplug and router again.........what a pain!

<review id="7915">Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)      We installed this on two computers, one running on Windows Vista, the other on XP.Once we decided it was not for us we couldn't remove it from the start-up tray even though the program itself was removed successfully. The icon "1" still stays next to the clock. Apparently one has to call Microsoft to remove that if it bothers you and we will.  What my husband didn't like (on his Vista pc) was that it interrupted him when he was working online and it was irritating to him to have to log back into where he was. If it didn't bump him offline it slowed him down.  He didn't want it on his PC. When I removed it the problem stopped. I noticed on my XP-based PC that it makes a lot of ticking sounds when it is scanning looking for viruses and I couldn't find out how to control when it does that. I didn't have that with other virus protection programs I had tried. It also slowed me down if I was online, going from page to page, but did not bump me off.I think the program works well enough especially if you are not a techy person.  It is good to have this reasonably priced protection to help you feel more secure.  Keep in mind that your router supplies a firewall, most major ISP's also provide virus and spam protection automatically.  OneCare doesn't provide spam protection, but Vista has Windows Defender that is free and does provide spy protection, so a good question is does one really need to buy more?  It is a personal preference choice.</review>

<review id="7916">Summary: This joystick is junk. Spend a little more money and buy something better. Although it has a great feel, the hardware is of the lowest quality. They don't last and are constantly loosing calibration. Furthermore, the certain features like the throttle slider, never work properly (full throttle on the joystick doesn't make full throttle in the game).  Also, the software is poor. Both the drivers and their task-tray application are sub-standard.  Looks like Logitech outsourced everything about this joystick. Cheap junk!</review>

<review id="7917">I should've known that paying half-price for the machine meant more of a problem than just a "resealed box." When I opened the manufacturer's box, I found a return slip from the person who previously bought it from Amazon and returned it, and it clearly stated that the machine was defective. I plugged it in and gave it a shot, but it's definitely defective. The control panel display  is messed up and the machine randomly turned on and tried to run, and I could only stop it by unplugging it. Also, it had no manual. On top of that, Amazon said that since I bought it through one of their subsidiaries, that I would only be able to return it & wait for my refund rather than have a replacement shipped out to me quickly. So, I don't have an opinion on the general operation of a working model, but just warning others to watch out for the "resealed" or "refurbished" models, unless you want a 13# paper weight.</review>

<review id="7919">I would rate this product with five stars except for the sizing.We bought the large. My son is nine months old, twenty pounds, and 27 inches. So the large should fit - and it will, many months from now. For now the sack is a SIDS risk as it easily slips over his head. My kid has a big head, right? This shouldn't happen.So we bought the small. Tiny! If I had known better, I would have timed my son's conception so that it would be summer now, when he fits into neither.We'll save the small for the next kid. We'll hope the large fits before the end of cold weather. But I'm seriously steamed that there's no medium to allow for another gradation in size. I really like kiddopotamus's products - looooved the snuzzler for the infant car seat. But this one I have to rate so low simply because there's going to be a lot of babies who will have to use something else in between the small and the large.</review>

<review id="7920">Although I have been a fan of the Twilight series I found this book a more difficult read.  While the first two books were real page turners, I did not feel that way about Eclipse.  I found it way too long and drawn out.  It was boring at times and I found I even had to put the book down for a few days and take a break from it before I could get back into it long enough to finish it. Now I will admit that as it got closer to the climax of the book, the pace did pick up and the ending was quite exciting. Overall It was not as good as books 1 and 2 but still good. I only hope Breaking Dawn is better.</review>

<review id="7921">Having used Tax Cut for the past several years and been pleased I went ahead and purchased the 2008 version.  The box looks the same and has the same title - but it is misleading in that this year the "free" state efile is not included.  H&R Block is touting a lie that the price didn't increase - it may be the same price as last year, but it's an inferior product since I now have to pay additional $$$ for state efile.  I'm disappointed with H&R Block's deceptive marketing.</review>

<review id="7922">Bad ratings hurt this "box set" not the show in it's entirety and justifiably so I might add.  It IS a great show but this blatant money making machine scam.  And most DVD sets don't cost about 100 dollars.  Stargate SG-1 is about 50, Quantum Leap averages 30-40, Stargate Atlantis is going for 45 dollars.  Even the greatest season of television ever, X-files Season 4, started at 100 but has come down in price to a more reasonable 57 dollars along with the rest of the series.  My personal recommendation, definitely check out the show but wait to buy it as a full season.  Don't buy half a season, that will only justify to the studio to do something like this again.</review>

<review id="7923">One of the films I was the most looking forward to seeing this past year, was "Rachel Getting Married". From the wonderful reviews, I couldn't wait to see it.

<review id="7924">I've owned a 128MB Lexar JumpDrive for a year and utterly love it, but would like to be able to transfer greater volumes of data among a number of PCs.  I was planning on getting another Lexar, but just happened to be in Circuit City when they were offering an unbeatable deal on the 512MB SanDisk Cruzer Micro: 45 dollers with a 15 dollar rebate.It proved slim enough to sit comfortably side-by-side on adjacent USB ports with my Lexar, and despite so much reviewer commentary on the cap, I thought it was snug enough, and I liked the little plastic desk stand that also came with it.  So I was quite pleased with the Cruzer Micro -- until I used it.On my home PC (Compaq 7100US, 1.3GHz Athlon, 768MB RAM, USB 1.1, WinME), a 13.6MB folder on my desktop (containing 309 files/57 folders) took OVER EIGHT MINUTES to read to the Cruzer Micro, THREE MINUTES to write back to my hard drive, and THREE MINUTES to delete from itself.  In comparison, my old Lexar JumpDrive took 115 seconds/30 seconds/50 seconds for the same tasks.Shocked by how excruciatingly slow the Cruzer Micro was, I thought it had to be defective, and emailed SanDisk tech support.  Meanwhile, I tested the Cruzer Micro on my work PC (Dell PWS350, 2.8GHz Pentium IV, 512MB RAM, USB 1.1, WinXP), this time with a 118MB folder (containing 2009 files/191 folders).  The Cruzer Micro took THIRTY-SEVEN MINUTES to read it (compared to my Lexar's 11 minutes).  I wasn't even going to attempt to write it back.SanDisk tech support told me to plug the device in the back, top, left-most USB port on the PC, since that one gets the most power.  Well, since my flash drive travels among friends', colleagues', and public PCs, I don't necessarily have access to a particular port, and such a requirement's not very convenient, is it?SanDisk also had me try formatting the Cruzer Micro to FAT (which also erased its installed security software), but read time on the test folder was still 35 minutes -- not much of an improvement.However, when I copied a *single* 32MB .exe file to the Cruzer Micro and it took only 20 seconds, what the problem was became clear:  the Cruzer Micro doesn't like small files -- email, docs, html, spreadsheets, jpegs, zips, anything that's not *individually* on a multimegabyte scale.SanDisk's response to this was (and I quote):  "I'm afraid our drives are optimized for copying few files of large and very large sizes and if you use your USB storage mainly to copy a quantity of small and very small files, then I would have to agree that our product does not meet your needs.  We apologize for the inconvenience."So the Cruzer Micro gets to keep a star for appearing to be a good product for really huge downloads, disk images, that sort of thing; and SanDisk keeps a star for reasonably prompt tech support and admitting to the Micro's limitations.  But three stars come off for touting speed on the package but stating nothing about the fact that if you want to transfer gobs of piddling files, the Cruzer Micro is slower than molasses.  If I had known this in advance, I'd have passed on what turned out to be a lousy deal.  Even for the price it's just way too slow, so the Cruzer Micro's going back.</review>

<review id="7925">I was using swaddlers (pampers yellow box) and then decided to try these baby-dry (pampers green box. My 5 month old is in a size 2 but when I ordered size 2 in the baby-dry they were to small even though she was still in the weight range (15lbs) they give on the box. So my advise is that the baby-dry pampers run small.</review>

<review id="7926">We really wanted to like this product.  We LOVE our Zoji Airpot, and when our beloved Bodum Electric Santos finally became too cruddy to look at anymore (it's just impossible to clean thoroughly) we were happy to see that Hammacher had rated this Zoji maker as a "Best" and that it had received good reviews here at Amazon.  Sadly, however, it's one fatal flaw for us is that the coffee is just not hot enough -- even when freshly brewed into the carafe.  We really tried to convince ourselves that it was our imagination, but it wasn't.  So ... the pot went back and we've opted for the Cuisinart DCC-1200 in Black and Stainless Steel.  Not QUITE as good a cup of coffee as the Bodum, but close . . . and hot!</review>

<review id="7928">It's nice to see that I'm not the only one who was disgruntled with this book.  After all the whining and professing that she can't live without Edward, she is on the verge of getting everything her selfish, snotty little soul can ask for.  All Edward wants is marriage and she can't EVEN grant him that???  He's done SO much for her, giving his life to her but she can't be unselfish enough to grant him his one wish?  But, of course, she is determined to spend eternity with him...today.  But not tomorrow, because, of course, after bullying everyone to her terms, SHE's not ready.  What the heck?  Is this girl seriously unbalanced?  She's rude to everyone if it goes against HER wants...no gifts, no parties, no wedding, no ring.  If she truly knew how to love, she would want to GIVE happiness to the people that she claims to love, not just take, take, take on HER terms only.  I found myself being quite upset with the main three characters of the book...Bella for being so wishy-washy and whiney and self-centered.  She claims she's nothing special but she apparently wants all the guys to be in love with her.  I just can't understand her actions.  She swears that Jake is ONLY a friend, yet she quickly changes all of that.  She's SOOO in love with Edward...or is that Jacob?  If you are as deeply in love with one person as she claims to be with Edward, why on earth do you keep trying to hook the other guy in?  She is a self-centered little twit.  I grew to hate Jacob in this book.  He's pushy and arrogant and is so in love with Bella that he assults her?!?  Yeah, that spells love in my book.  Yeah, right.  He claims he's her friend but he doesn't act like a friend, give in gracefully and be supportive.  Plus his "fantasies" about Bella while he knows that Edward can hear, makes me move him into the most hated charater side.  He's as self-centered as Bella.  Maybe they WOULD make the best pair since they only care about themselves.  Edward, in his "I want nothing but her happiness" turns into a wuss.  I can't believe that he's just so happy to let her and Jacob stomp all over him. In the early part of the book, he's snarling at Jacob to keep his hands to himself...or else.  By the end of the book, he's condoning Jacob holding her all night because he can't keep her from freezing. He's too good in this book.  Grow a pair, boy!  And don't EVEN get me started on Charlie.  What a sterling guy he is!  NOT.  "Please assult my daughter because YOU are the one I'm routing for."  No wonder Bella is so messed up.  I have to say that my favorite characters in this book are Alice, Jasper and Emmett.I'll read the last one and I'm still routing for Edward, but if I were him, I'd tell Bella to take a hike and I wouldn't look back.</review>

<review id="7929">I was happy with the coffee maker until 3mos from the date of purchase it stopped brewing coffee.  When I reviewed the warranty info in the manual, I was not happy.  After paying $100 for the machine (which I thought was a lot for a "coffeemaker"), the manufacturer wants me to pay for shipping the defective product back and I am also responsible for a $10 fee as well.  I opened a service order with the manufacturer and they clearly gave me instructions to return defective unit with payment or I could pay with a CC over the phone - I told the rep I would call back the next day with CC#.  Without payment or defective unit they sent me the replacement machine.  Some may think I am foolish for not keeping the machine, however, I called them back and asked why they shipped when I did not call back all they said was that they would authorize pickup of the unit.  I am waiting for UPS to pick up now. I will think twice before purchasing any Cuisinart product in the future.</review>

<review id="7932">Buyer beware! this product is not as advertised. I thought I was buying a leftover crate of the old size 1-2 swaddlers, which were bigger than 1 and smaller than 2. The box was as pictured, but when I opened it there were 4 packages of 54 size 1 diapers only.   They do seem to be real swaddlers, but a different size than suggested on the packaging.  My baby will probably outgrow this size shortly as she is gaining 1/2 pound a week. I found the 1-2 size very useful with my last baby and was excited to find a leftover box, but this NOT a good deal for any parent trying to obtain a diaper that fits babies up to 7 kg, as stated on the box (not 6 kg like the size 1 diapers that I received- >a two-week difference in a rapidly growing baby). Very disappointed in Amazon this time, as I had heard great things about buying diapers from them...</review>

Never try to return anything to this company, they won't give your money back even if their player is defective and you don't want a new one.</review>

<review id="7935">I bought the BBC Blu Ray version of this after watching the whole series on Discovery HD channel and I fell in love with what i saw. The series is absolutely amazing. I gave it 1 star for this versions packaging for reasons below.This BBC Blu Ray release version is HORRIBLE!1st and foremost 1 of the discs in this box set was an HD DVD format disc... not even Blu Ray! They actually gave me one disc in the wrong format. 2nd the video quality of this encoding is a mixture of great to horrible. Some shots are crystal clear and beautiful. Followed by a cut of a series of shots that are very grainy and snowy looking (its not my equipment, it was the encoding of these discs) The Discovery HD channel shows I saw did not have these grainy snowy shots in the same portion. I know, because I compared the ondemand version of it directly against the Blu Ray version and I couldn't believe how poorly encoded this versions transfer was.3rd (this one is subjective only) if you are buying this cause you liked the discovery channels narration, please realize the narrator on this original BBC version is different and to me talks in such a mellow monochromatic way it almost lulls you to sleep! I knew the narrator was going to be different before I bought this. What I did not know is I would not like the narrators performance.</review>

<review id="7937">According to Nuance Software, Dragon won't install if your computer doesn't support it. That's not true. Dragon will install, but this version won't install properly unless your CPU handles SSE2.So, it will install and then embed itself on your computer, but not be able to actually run. So, you can't uninstall it (because it's running) and you can't run it (because it's running and your computer doesn't handle SSE2) and you can't reinstall it (because it's running) and finally, you take the disc out and you whip it at your wall. Then you contact Nuance for a return authorization and they accidentally hang up you. After wasting 2 hours of your work day on this buggy software, you finally give up and go write a nasty Amazon review.</review>

<review id="7940">After reading the other reviews on Amazon, we decided to purchase 2 heart rate monitors so my husband and I could both have one.  When we recieved them, my husband's worked great for about 2 weeks.  Then the watch battery gave out.  We have to take it in because the battery is not easily  accessible for changing. My monitor never worked.  We figured out that the battery in the chest transmitter was bad.  I contacted Omron about the problem and after pressing them to do something, they agreed to send a new battery for the transmitter.  It's now three weeks later and I still have no battery.  I called back and Omron said they would send it.  We wonder if part of the problem is that the batteries are in the watch and transmitter when you get it so if it's been sitting on the shelf for a year or so, the batteries are already worn out.  Who knows.  We haven't really been able to use the heart rate monitor much because of the battery issues.  It's been a hassle so that's why such a low star rating.  We've been very disappointed in the batteries and Omron's service.</review>

<review id="7944">When I first bought this in summer 2007, I was very happy with this little camera.  But soon after, I started to struggle with uploading the videos onto my computer.  Nine tries out of ten, the PC just didn't seem to "see" the device, so the Flip software failed to initiate.  It took me multiple attempts to save my video files onto my PC.  Finally today, after spending a maddening two hours trying to retrieve updated firmware from the Flip webside and trying every USB port on my PC without being able to save my videos, I called customer support.  A very nice and patient man spent 3 hours on the phone with me and we still couldn't figure it out.  After all else failed, he finally suggested I take it to a nearby CVS Pharmacy that happens to have a Pure Digital machine that could make a DVD from the videos on the Flip recorder.  It didn't work.  The CVS machine didn't "see" my Flip either.  So, six hours later, my videos are still trapped on my Flip and I am no closer to a solution.  The nice young man in customer support said he would escalate my case to higher level technical support and I should expect a call back in a few days.  I'm so sorry I bought this product.  What a sad waste of time and money!</review>

<review id="7945">Received this as a gift.  Used it for a month.  Tried cleaning it this morning, but the bean holder will not sit correctly and the burrs have locked in place.  Capresso has a customer service line, but it dropped me to a voicemail box, which was annoying.  Received a call from the customer service line after leaving a voicemail message.Apparently, there is a black plastic ring around the burrs in the top of the machine.  The bean holder is intended to mate with a slot in that top ring.  All I needed to do was spin the ring counter-clockwise so that the left-most edge of the slot in the ring was even with the middle of the grinding options.  The ring actually turns easily if you stick a butter knife into the slot.  Fortunately, the bean holder did not break as a result of this problem -- small crack, but it still works -- but I have no idea how the problem was caused in the first place.Based on being able to fix the problem, I'd take my review back up to two stars.  Seems too easy to break during cleaning...</review>

<review id="7946">After the fourth we've finally come to the conclusion in the Breaking Dawn series...or have we? I just can't see Step Meyer ending with this one. I'll try to write a review with as many spoil free moments as I can. We are all familiar with this series and with Step Meyer's writing - the series is full of break-neck twists and high-speed turns and the same holds true for book four....maybe even more so. So let's hop in the sports car and see where she takes us. Throughout the series we've been given clues that let our imagination take us beyond the pages of the series without Step Meyers writing another book and this in turn has sparked a limitless supply of discussions. The characters have always held for me a love/hate quality and I've found myself in past books saying "?" But whilst the three previous versions had me saying "?" by the end of the book, book four started out with me thinking "?" But just after the midway point everything starts to come into focus. You begin to understand the characters' decisions, their rationality toward relationship choices, and everything begins to make sense. I guess what I'm saying is: book four starts out on a rocky patch but a smooth drive is the end result. A key scene between Bella and Edward happens early probably why the book starts out rocky. Does Bella finally turn into a vampire? Step Meyer has created a great series that has compelled thousands of readers and has turned Bella into a heroine for teens and adults alike. And while her books are well-written, book four did end-up reading like a b-rated romance. After finishing the book I'm left with the feeling if the series continues, book five will go back to the roots of the series and we'll continue through Edward's point of view.</review>

<review id="7947">I have been a long-time user of Iomega Zip drives...the internal type.  They have worked great and are convenient for quick access, transfer and back-up of daily computer files.  I have some 60 Zip disks filled with an assortment of important files.Since my internal Zip drive is on the same ribbon cable as my hard drive, and I wanted to add another hard drive to my computer, I had to give up the internal Zip drive (only two devices per ribbon cable).  Therefore, I purchased the external Iomega 250MB USB Zip drive.It is a plug-and-play device, so installation is instant.  I put in my first disk and presto...it came alive...with a clunk, a grind and an assortment of other strange noises...it started working.  First task...transfer about 24MB of info on to a disk.  I waited and waited and waited some more.  12 minutes later it was finished.  With the internal Zip drive this task would have taken about 12 seconds.  I could have gone out and washed the car during the time I waited.  My computer has USB2.0 but the device is only a USB1.1, so that might have something to do with it.Not only did this drive take forever to complete its task, it was uncomfortably noisy.  It makes all kinds of grinding noises, sometimes slowing down to a crawl then speeding up again.  My internal drive made a little noise, but nothing like this.  Forget about doing anything else on your computer while the Zip drive is chugging along.I cannot recommend this product at all.  It is slow and noisy and leaves me the general feeling of...well, being ripped off...because it is basically a cheap piece of junk!At one time Zip drives were the best way to archive files simply because there were no other convenient options available.  But, I think it is time to toss out all those old Zip disks and go to USB2.0 flash drives for easily accessible back-up and storage.  For the big, more permanent archiving I burn files to CD's or DVD's.  For daily back-ups and quick access, flash drives appear now to be the way to go.Iomega had better consider producing other storage products because if they keep making junk like this, they won't be in business much longer.</review>

<review id="7948">Update:  As I said, I emailed customer service.  I heard nothing so I checked the "support" site and looked at the action on my request.  Here is what appeared:New Email*** Call Date: 8/15/2008 8:50:58 AM Agent: LorenC Level: 3  Status: ClosedI called the 800 number, followed the several voice prompts to "customer service" and got the recording, "all of our agents are assisting other customers, your call will be answered in the order in which it was received."  I waited 15 minutes and then called the listed headquarters number (not toll free)  There I ran into more voice prompts at three levels and wound up with the same robot telling me again how everyone is busy.I used to enjoy this program.  Now I have such a bad taste for Nuance that I will go back to typing or to a quill pen and papyrus before I use anything from Nuance again.Here's my original review:I have a new HP laptop with plenty of memory and speed.  It runs vista home premium.  I tried to load DNS X and kept getting the message I needed to restart my computer in order to load the required runtime C++  I let it play that game with me about four times until I realized I was being played.  I went to the Nuance technical support page and looked up the problem in the "knowledgebase."  There it was - continually telling me to restart is apparently a common problem.  There are detailed instructions on how to delete temp files and modify the registry to cure the problem.  I did it all and still got the same message - "restart."  So, it was time for an email to tech support to find out what I need to do.  Well, the first thing I needed to do was pay Nuance 10 dollars to send the email.I wrote to customer service instead and said I want my money back under the 30 day guarantee.  It's a good program and I upgraded from version 7.  But I absolutely refuse to pay anything to any company to be able to install the program I just bought from that company.  By the way - there is no way to download a trial to see if it will install before buying.</review>

<review id="7949">I'm very disappointed in this product.  I got it for FREE through a link on the Intuit website, but wish I had never installed it as it has messed up my computer's ability to connect to the Internet.  Everything was fine until I registered the software, and then... I can't connect to the Internet at all.  Not via Firefox, Explorer, or any other browser.

<review id="7950">I purchased Office 2007 along with my new computer recently.  I expected the program to be similar to Office 2003, with some adjustments important for Windows Vista compatibility.  To my dismay, Word and Excel have been catastrophically redesigned to the point of being useless.  If you are a veteran user of these programs, you will find that many keyboard shortcuts are no longer functional.  Colors and effects you are used to in Excel graphs are no longer possible to replicate.  Menus are extinct in these programs and have been replaced with a horribly gaudy ribbon that must have been designed for and by complete idiots.  The reasoning for such a comprehensive overhaul of two previously very functional programs escapes me.  Obviously, the engineers have never heard the saying, "if it aint broke, don't fix it."  Go to the ends of the earth to find a copy of Office 2003 before wasting any money on this product.  Good luck!</review>

<review id="7955">This popcorn popper is terrible.  It pops maybe 1/3 of the kernels, and the flow is not very well-directed, so it blows unpopped kernels and popped corn all over my kitchen.

<review id="7957">I purchased the HV30 and fell in love at first video frame. Unfortunately, the honeymoon was soon over when I tried to edit. The firewire port on the camera failed after one edit session. This seems to happen frequently with the HV30 as evidenced by the number of owners seeking answers as to why it worked one day with their computers and not the next. Finding solutions are next to impossible though everyone tells you to try this and that. I know that it is not the computer's firewire because I'm able to connect my other video cameras without a hitch. I am sending it back to the factory for repair. I hope this was just part of a bad batch and not systemic.</review>

<review id="7960">SEE UPDATE BELOW!After 2 months of daily use the paint on the keys is wearing off to the point I now have several keys that are just clear circles.  Since I'm a touch typist I'm not completely crippled by this, but I still find this to be a major quality issue so I will be putting Logitech on the bottom of my list of options on future keyboard purchases.  As a side note, I feel the backlit keys on this keyboard is really more bling then functional because the color of the light and low light output requires you get fairly close to the keys to see the keys correctly so in complete darkness the feature provides limited functionality.  Besides after limited use the keys will lose the paint and become just blue circles of light.  The macro keys seem to function as designed but this isn't the only keyboard with this feature so really unless you plan to use this keyboard strictly for bling I would look for a better product.UPDATE:I contacted Logitech support and explained my issue with the paint and they gave me a RMA number to send my keyboard back for a replacement.  They also told me this was a known issue and that the paint on the keys of the replacement keyboard would not wear off!  And I'm happy to report after about a month of use I do not see any signs of wear on the keys.  So if you buy this keyboard you might try to validate it is one of the new versions but I'm not sure how you would do that.  But if you already have this keyboard and the paint is coming off try contacting Logitech support to get an RMA.</review>

<review id="7962">This movie was as close to a waste of time as a Bond movie can get. The action sequences are so busy and disjointed you can't follow what's going on, who's doing what to whom. Forster has taken the jerky action cam thing to the ugly extreme. It's not even coherent enough to make you dizzy...you just sit there completely clueless as to what's going on.What's more, I'm just not down with the whole Bond as a "blunt instrument" thing these last two movies are promoting. That is not Bond. Bond is a suave, subtle, nuanced instrument who uses brains and ingenuity, and when all else fails, cool, gee-whiz gadgets...always the polished gentleman, and the ultimate ladies man (one look and they swoon). Daniel Craig is none of those things. I didn't like him as a choice when he was first announced, but decided to withhold judgment. But after two films I'm decided: he's not Bond.

<review id="7965">This review is from: Quantum of Solace [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)      Quite frankly this movie was a dismal follow-up to Casino Royale. I loved the story driven Royale but Quantum was two hours of shiny objects and pointless characters. The bond girls looked and acted like teenage girls trying to be tough guys. What on earth was the point of the redhead who "was an office worker" being sent to bring Bond in? He's a "Double O" and they send the gopher from the secretary pool to pick him up in a kinky Eskimo-hooker-boot and raincoat outfit? Good move. I guess if we followed that logic in real life we'd send girl scouts after Bin-Laden. Throw the cookies at him girls! Get him! Get him! I do have to admit, however, that Craig and Dench really work well together and their scenes together are spectacular. Aside from that this movie really didn't even seem to try. Maybe because people complained about the long run time for Royale they chopped this one up into tiny bite-sized action shots and shortened it by cutting out all the quieter moments that give us time to breathe and reflect on why that last action scene was necessary while giving us a scene with actual acting and dialogue. Keep the longer run time and give us more intrigue and less explosions. And a less annoying opening montage would be better too.I have read reviews where some have said that the theme song for Quantum was wonderful because of the two vocalists involved. I hope you realize how flimsy that is. Even Beethoven did some second rate work. I thought that the entire opening sequence from song to visuals was a sad throwback to what made some (just some, not all)of the old bond films laughable in the first place. What is the point of a reboot for a series if you are going to repeat the mistakes of the past? I loved the visuals and music for Royale as they took the old theme and blended it together with some very interesting ideas. Quantum's opener features naked women gadding about to music that seems to have been created by recording two cats being smacked together.As a closing note I would like to say that this movie, despite comparisons to the contrary, did not remind me of the Bourne films in the slightest. At least those movies kept a thread of dignity and actual plot mixed in with the hectic "Shakey-Cam" action sequences and car chases. What I wouldn't give for a genuine spy film these days.</review>

<review id="7966">I'm not a computer "newbie" and I could not, after about 5 hours, get past the Visual C++ error messages as so many others are reporting even after consulting Nuance's knowledge database and following all their suggestions.    Then I called my daughter in Nashville who is an IT graduate from Penn State University who has vast knowledge of computers and she spent another approximate 3 to 4 hours with me attempting to install this HORROR of a program.  I never did get it to move past the Visual C++ error message.I don't understand why, if this is such a common error with this program, Nuance doesn't simply put out a patch to make the program work properly.  Guess that would be too easy and not cost effective for them or something.  I can't imagine the nightmares that anyone who is slightly "computer-challenged" would face attempting to install this mess they are foisting off on us as a functional worthwhile program.  Unfortunately, I did not try to install it before the 30 day limit was up so a refund is not possible - therefore, I wasted my money.  Never again Nuance-Never again</review>

<review id="7967">While Consumer Reports gave this coffeemaker a good rating, I have to disagree on two points: one is the clock, which will jump ahead by several hours when you turn your back (in fact, I don't even know if it has the numbers 7, 8 or 9). Hence, you cannot program the coffeemaker because the time is always off by a mile. Second, the pour spout is wide, which makes it nice for not spilling, but not so great for keeping the coffee hot. I have to nuke it for 25 seconds for a steaming cup. Oh, and it has annoying hissing habit, not when it's first warming up, but all the time. You can do better than this model.</review>

<review id="7968">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      it is an excellent film but it came damaged. i recommend it seeing as it is a fantastic movie and it only costs 4$ but amazon is supposed to check and make sure that the product isn't damaged but clearly they didn't. bottom line is that it is a great movie but don't count on it getting there safely.</review>

<review id="7969">This review is from: The Princess Bride (DVD)      I heard a lot of great things about this film, but I was sorely disappointed when I rented it last night. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't nearly as good as I thought it was going to be. Princess Buttercup annoyed the crap out of me, too.</review>

<review id="7970">This is everything I wanted it to be apart from one point. The wifi range is abysmal. Asus claim it has 802.11N and it is compatible with 802.11N routers but barely meets the range requirements for 802.11A. I teach networking and have tried the unit with dlink, cisco, netgear and linksys routers and compared it's performance with Dell, Toshiba, Fijitsu, Sony and Tabletkiosk laptops. In open, unobstructed range the 1000H had half the range of any of the laptops on all the routers.Performance is what you might expect from an Atom processor. It's a great little unit rendered practically useless for me by the fact that the wifi is so poor.</review>

<review id="7971">Let me begin by saying that I really enjoyed the first three books in the Twilight series. So I started Breaking Dawn and it almost immediately made me want to stop. I could care less about the wedding details, this book really is written for teenage girls, huh? I was about to get bored with the honeymoon when Meyers takes us to absurdity in her plot twist. I couldn't help but wonder if Meyers thought the plot was so twisted and unlike her main character that she decided to switch to another characters first person for 'Book 2'. I mean I like Jacob, I mean I really do (more thatn most of Meyer's fans probably), but I would have much preferred the books all be told from Bella's perspective. The pregnant Bella was to far a stretch for Meyer's to write I presume? That's fine, but lets edit some of these pages, does the pregnancy which doesn't last all that long, really have to take up so much of the book?Then the baby, Renesmee? Let's look past her ridiculous name for a moment-oh wait, that is just too hard to do. Let me gasp, sigh, and roll my eyes. OK, back to my review. Jacob imprinting on Nessie (better name choice?). I saw it coming but how I wished Meyer's wasn't going to let me down in this fashion after the first two sections of Breaking Dawn had been such a letdown, but no, she goes through with it even though Leah was a better match in my opinion. I was hoping someone in the story could form a relationship the old fashioned way but I guess not. I can stomach Bella's overcoming of most of the drawbacks to the newborn stage but Charlie coming over. Are you serious? If I wasn't so interested in just how bizarre this book could get, I would have stopped reading pages ago.So I try to overlook most of the bad silly things that happen and look at the positives for this tale as I am investing a lot of spare time into this 754 page book. Meyer's tries to fit the pieces together pretty well. I like the supernatural powers and even the wolf twist, I was even managing to accept the imprinting scenario as were Edward and Bella when the book was winding down-slowly-slowly-slowly through the Volturi visit when what do I come across but Jacob crying a tear the size of a baseball, a BASEBALL. This was it. I must have read this sentence 14 times. A baseball. Really. Well, that really tells me how sad he was at the prospect of losing Bella. Baseball (come back eyes, don't stay back there).Baseballs aren't really huge, unless you have tears the size of them. Then they are just ridiculous. I would have cried from laughing if I didn't feel so inferior to these large, perfectly rounded tears of Jacobs. I am being insensitive, aren't I? Oh well, I can't seem to help myself.Anyways, I had to get that off my shoulder. The book ended OK, I would have liked to have seen an actual physical confrontation between the Voturi and the rest of the vampires but I will take the ending she gave us. Hoping that it is the end.Stopping at Eclipse was probably best, but ending now, you know with your "THE END" page and all it's finality at the end of Breaking Dawn is respectable.</review>

<review id="7973">I had purchased this straightener based on recommendations when I blew out my old one in Italy.  It doesn't work on my hair at all (fine, frizzy hair) and left my hair looking dead and dull.  A friend of mine has the Maxiglide (my old one that I killed) and it straightened everything out and made it look silky so this one is going on Ebay.  I'm very, very diappointed in it.</review>

<review id="7974">I also own an Osterizer Kitchen Center after 25+ years of use along with experiencing the motor's irregular speed fits.  And also, envious of the KitchenAid reputation decided on this product 4 years ago.  I very rarely use it and am thankful for my standby Oster and a Sunbeam handmixer I may have to replace soon.  The KitchenAid never fully mixes the stuff on the bottom, it is difficult to scrape the sides besides having to take the time to mix the bottom, and forget trying to whip up Dream Whip topping.  The motor seems to be louder and more annoying than any other appliance I have and my husband and visitors have asked, "Do they all sound like that?"  But, I have talked to other owners of the smaller KitchenAid Mixers who are quite happy with the results.  I did purchase a grinder attachment and am very happy with the results but I could have stuck with just my Oster.  ...</review>

<review id="7975">I bought this thing because I had read (I think in another review) that the sound quality and the recording capability were good. That is not the case. It will not record, without distortion, the singing voice in the upper range, sung even at moderate dynamic levels. It's, therefore, in my estimation, pretty worthless for recording music. As are 10,000,000 other products out there - it's great for recording video. I am afraid to experiment any further trying to find an easy-to-use video camera with decent sound. It's too expensive to experiment like this!</review>

<review id="7977">It had a great message, but it contained,in my opinion,terrible acting, too much preaching, too much of a predictable outcome. It was a B movie all the way, but fell below that standard almost. I still say it has a great message for all married couples, for all men and women planing on getting maried, and all folks that their marriage may be in diar straights...</review>

<review id="7979">This Linksys is the most expensive router I have purchased.  For the price I expected trouble-free music streaming AND good tech support.  I recieved neither.

<review id="7981">I was so excited to see that amazon was able to give me a better price than what ulta was selling it for, so I bought it.

<review id="7982">This movie had almost nothing to do with the fact that the husband was a fire fighter. Like others, I was picturing a Ladder 49 type of movie. Definitely not the case. The acting in this movie has to be the WORST acting I have ever seen. It was painful to watch ! With such a good title I expected this movie to be great and was greatly disappointed. I understand the message the movie was trying to get across, but they did it in a very poor manner.  Some of the parts that were trying to be religious were ridiculous -- when the lady was eating lunch and stopped talking in the middle of conversation to pray, it was SO cheesy. And just like that part, nothing in this movie felt real. You don't ever feel the relationship between Catherine and her husband, its like strangers fighting. This movie is garbage. Seriously all the ' Fireproof your marriage ' hype must be based off of the books or something because I just can not imagine so many people being so obsessed with such a lame movie.</review>

<review id="7983">It has now been TOO many times that I have been convinced to buy a product from Intuit, and then only after buying, find out that the product does not do what is claimed by the manufacturer.  Several times I have found this true with QuickBooks Pro, and now most recently, TurboTAX.  Most of these problems seem to be related to the MAC platform, and I don't think they have anything to do with Apple or the Mac, rather Intuit's lack of care and support for the MAC community of users.  Watch out!This product, "for Windows and Mac", does NOT "create W-2 and 1099-MISC forms for your employees and contractors" on a Mac.  Read fine print no. 4. "Windows only".This product, "works with Quickbooks" does not import "data from ....Quickbooks....to save you time".  Again, the fine print (Turbo Tax website) is that it only imports from Quickbooks for Windows (2006 or higher).I could go on about the myriad ways in which Intuit has left the Mac community out in the cold, but I won't, because most of my additional complaints are about the Quickbooks product.If you have a Windows computer, don't pay too much attention to this review.  If you're on a MAC, abandon Intuit as soon as you find a better alternative.  My impression - Intuit STINKS on a Mac!</review>

<review id="7984">I recently bought a new laptop, and the changeover involved an "upgrade" to Office 2007.  I was aware that there was a new user interface, but was not aware that Office 2007 is, in almost every respect, an INFERIOR product to any Office version that came before it!   I have used MS Office for many years, and am what could be called a "power user," especially for Word and Powerpoint, which I use weekly.       One of the great features of Office is that it has been totally customizable.  For those who use office frequently, it has been easy to create your own custom toolbars so you have what you need easily available.  Most tasks could be done with one or two mouse clicks... Until Office 2007!   In Office 2007, hardly anything is customizable!  You have a constantly changing tool ribbon, which takes up a lot of screen real estate.     The ribbon presents a set of icons based on what it "thinks" you will need at the moment.  It is rarely right!  ... so you go searching through the tabs trying to find the icon that was on the ribbon a few moments earlier!  There is one small "tool bar" up on the title bar that you CAN customize, but it is not convenient, and will not hold many icons.  It has the option of being moved below the ribbon, which takes up even more screen real estate, but is still very limited, and cannot be docked or moved from there.   Granted, there are third party programs, such as Ribbon Customizer and Toolbar Toggle, that add back some of the ability to customize, but it is still far inferior to what Office users are used to!   Even the third party programs, however, cannot get around the fact that there are some features in earlier Office versions that are simply NOT included in the new one.  In previous versions of Powerpoint, you could add a set of icons that, with one mouse click, allowed you to adjust the vertical spacing of text.  That has been omitted in 2007.  In the "improved" 2007 version, you must open a dialog box, and make several mouse clicks to adjust vertical spacing!   To make matters worse, Office 2007 documents are not compatible with earlier versions.  After spending years establishing formats such as .doc and .ppt as industry standards, Microsoft has introduced a version of office that does not use these formats!  If you want to send a document to someone who still has Office 2003 (or any other program that reads .doc files) you need to remember to save it in that format.  The default 2007 format cannot be opened by earlier versions!   Office 2007 CAN open the older formats, but even in opening earlier Office formats, there are problems.  For example, most users of Powerpoint have learned the trick of adding drop shadows behind the text to make the text stand out on the screen.  Office 2007 has changed the way these shadows are formed.  When you open a powerpoint presentation made on an earlier version, your old drop shadows WILL NOT ANIMATE with the text.  When a slide appears, the shadows of the letters are already in place, and the letters animate in on top!  Mircosoft's only suggestion... go through your slides and take the old shadows out, and put new shadows in!  (I tried this... it takes 30-40 minutes per presentation!  ...And I have hundreds of powerpoint presentations in my file!)     For someone who never used Office before, or who just uses Word to type simple letters, 2007 may be okay, but for anyone who depends on Office for detailed tasks and productivity, 2007 is a nightmare.     I have always loved Microsoft Office.  It has been an industry standard for ease of use. In my opinion, that is no longer the case.  I believe Microsoft tried to produce something "different" to attract new users, but in the process totally ignored the needs of those who have used their products in the past.  If you have the option of staying with an earlier version, DO NOT UPGRADE to this product!</review>

<review id="7985">I enjoyed using this product until it came time to file. My return continues to be rejected saying that I am entering my son's SS# in wrong. I have not entered it wrong and called the Social Security Office to double check. So even after using this product I will not be able to e-file - which is why I bought it in the first place.

<review id="7989">I was looking for a cheap Mp3 player for a friend traveling to a high theft area. This product seemed perfect until it arrived.

I threw it away... not even worth the trouble of returning!!!!!Don't buy !</review>

<review id="7990">Hated it. I was so in love with the first 3 books. It's focus was on Bella and Edward and their courtship. Then all of a sudden, with Breaking Dawn, everything changed. There's no excuse for it. It ruined everything that the first 3 books were leading up to. And she kept reusing the same facial expressions over and over again and how their voices were like bells and stuff. We got it already.... move on. And Renesmee? Stupidest name ever! Stop reading the saga after book 3. I wish I never read it.</review>

<review id="7991">Absolutley do not buy this. It is ridiculous that they release this box set without the final ten episodes of the season. All they had to do was wait threee months to deliver a proper box set. But they are trying to do nothing more than squeeze you for an extra $50. Season 4.0 $50 plus season 4.1 $50 equalls twice as much money as they made for realeasing season 3 in one complete season. Stand up for your rights not to be squeezed for more money during a recesion by the big movie studioes looking to supplument their lowered revenue. DON'T BUY THIS!!!

<review id="7992">I have had a another manufacturer's USB flash drive for over 3 years, and needed more space.Last year Amazon recommended this model , and the price was right.the problem was, that within a month of getting this drive, the part that holds it to your keychain fractured.  I used it for awhile but found myself forgetting or misplacing it more and more.  I still have the old, smaller one, on my keychain every day.  I couldn't tell you where this one went.

<review id="7993">After noticing problems with the 5ghz range working with 2.4 at the same time I was noticing dropouts as well.

<review id="7996">Defective product, save your money and don't buy. Just looking at the reviews you know this product has a high rate of failure.

If you read through the other FreeAgent external drive listings you will see this is not a problem limited to only this one.Amazon won't back the product and will just refer you to Seagate who will tell you to ship it back to them at your cost for a refurb.

<review id="7997">This router's memory and processor are anemic.  Do not use this router if you need to have a lot of simultaneous connections going.  This means any p2p application.  It'll lock up, drop configurations, and need to be reset constantly.  I have spent days debugging this router only to discover that its processor and memory just can't handle all the connections.  For some reason it also keeps connection information in memory for 5 days, further exacerbating the problem.I have just ordered the D-Link DGL-4300 gaming router, which has not yet arrived.  Supposedly it can handle thousands of connections and not degrade your speed critical applications such as VOIP.  It seems to be the next generation of router, and at less than $150 it might sound expensive, but I honestly have spent most of today offline, and have had to reset my Linksys WRT54G literally dozens of times.  I even wasted hours swapping it out with other ones to see if the router itself was bad.  They all were (I have versions 1, 1.1, 2, and 5 of this same router)</review>

<review id="7998">I purchased this netbook almost a month ago and was very pleased with its performance UNTIL I let the battery run down while it was still on.  The owners manual says you should recycle the battery completely several times for maximum performance and battery life, what they didn't say was that if you let it go completely down while the netbook is on you'll never get it to boot up again.  This is an ongoing issue which they've failed to warn owners about, needless to say my netbook has been sent back for repair as there's no way to resolve the problem yourself, the reset button has no effect since the hard-drive does not respond.  Other laptops I've owned prefer you completely discharge the battery for maximum performance, something which ASUS will have to fix.  The 900HA otherwise is a good little performer, it does everything I'd expect from a normal laptop, only in miniature size.</review>

<review id="7999">The product itself is great.  I have 2 children (5 and 8) and this is a great way to get the family together, have fun and eat ice cream.I gave the lowest rating becasue of the shipping.  I purchased this item for Christmas, with ample time for delivery.  The product arrived on time, but it arrived at my doorstep in the box you would see on the shelf, not a regular brown shipping box.  The box was covered with shipping labels, stickers, etc, but was not taped closed, so the plastic wrap and styrofoam packing inside was hanging out - with some missing.  The box was also crushed on 3 of the 4 top corners, and had several black "skid-marks" - I guess from sliding around while on it's journey to my house.  The scuff marks were so bad, the manufacturers name was missing the last 5 letters.  The box was in such bad shape, I was certian the product was damaged.  Fortuniately, Cuisinart packs their products well, and everything works fine - but it's hard to keep a suprise from other people in the house when the item is shipped this way.  We will definately use this until it is worn out, but never again will I purchase from this vendor.</review>

<review id="8000">I would have to say that this is not worth buying. The reason...if you want to keep your child from roaming around while you are out of the room, like cleaning the kitching, this will not do it, for all he/she has to do is move it to where he/she wants to go. also it will tip over if your child leans over to much on one side.  We bought the play yard to make sure our child was safe while we cleaned up the house, well, he moved it. He also was able to bend it out of shape (which could have pinched his fingers) he moved the play yard all over the house and was able to get into things that he should not have.so if I could I would returned it, or if I read something like this review, I would not have bought it.on a scale from 1 to 10 I would have to give it a 3</review>

<review id="8001">I write this review to urge you to steer away from purchasing this product.  After reading the four positive reviews on Amazon, I was excited to dive in and place massive quantities of video and audio on my new, shiny, iPod-like designed Seagate drive.  I opened the drive on December 23rd and started by backing up all of the data I currently have externally stored.  That worked well enough but with fairly slow transfer speeds.The real kicker is that today, December 27th, after 5 days of using my new drive, it has started to click loudly and I can no longer read the data from the drive.  I have tried many different techniques to bring my drive back to life with no luck.  Very depressing.  I strongly encourage you to not purchase this hard drive despite the relatively low cost and high capacity.  I did not drop, kick, or otherwise mistreat my new drive.On a surprising note, I made the purchase from [...] through Amazon, and when I called them with my issue, they immediately sent a shipping label to my Gmail account and they indicated that I should expect a full refund (including shipping) within the next few days.  I will have to wait to see if it is as straightforward and quick as he claimed, but if it is, I could not imagine asking for a more responsive and sympathetic vendor (I believe the specific fellow's name was Ricardo - thanks Ricardo if you're out there).I don't know if the failure is a one-in-a-million event, but your data is valuable to you and losing it is an expensive and time-consuming proposition.  For your own protection, please do not let the low cost and familiar brand name entice you to buy this drive.</review>

<review id="8003">When I first finished Breaking Dawn, I was in bliss.  It all ended so perfectly and I could gloss over the parts that I didn't like.  Well reading a couple of reviews off the internet gave me a necessary knock on the head.  I did not love this book.  I didn't even really like it that much.  There was so much wrong with it that I couldn't believe how deluded I had been by the leftover adrenaline rush of the release party.  I began carefully re-analyzing the book, and discovered a few things that bugged me above all others.  *SPOILERS*First off, Edward.  I have always been the typical Edward lover.  I loved his over-cautiousness, how his eyes smoldered and burned and turned liquid.  I guess I was just an infatuated teenager.  Well, the first 100 pages of the book were great.  I thought it was hilarious how he took her to Isle Esme, and I loved the feathers.   However it seemed to me after Jacob's point of view, Edward, and some of the other Cullens too, lost their personality completely.  His eyes were either golden or black, they weren't described the way the used to be.  It was like he was a paper doll, just filling in a necessary part.Next, my issue with the rest of the Cullens.  Where was Alice?  I love Alice, she is one of my all time favorite fictional characters ever.  I love her bubbly happiness, and how she is so full of life.  Well, right after she figured out that she couldn't "see" Renesmee, she was sitting at the top of the staircase for the rest of the book.  And it wasn't just the absence of personality, it was the complete 180 that the characters took.  What was up with Em, and Jazz?  I swear she got those off of a fan-fic I read somewhere.  Carlisle called Edward "Son" half the time, and for some reason that really bugged me.  The only Cullen who had much of a personality was Rosalie.  How sad is that?Next Renesmee.  What kind of a name is Renesmee?  Honestly.  Typical with the rest of the book, she was perfect, and a paper doll.  Bella now has the perfect husband, the perfect daughter who doesn't make messes and grows right through that stage of not sleeping through the night in about an hour.  Bella doesn't have to feed, hold or take care of her in any way, so she is free to spend her time with her perfect husband.  It also pretty conveniently solved the whole Jacob issue by having him imprint on Bella's daughter.  I find that a bit creepy when you think that if Bella hadn't gone with Edward, Jacob would never have imprinted.Okay, now for my issue with the ending.  Without some sort of a sacrifice, you cannot appreciate a happy ending.  Bella was planning to give up her family, her friends, and ever having children to be with Edward.  Well what a surprise, she passes right through the newborn phase without ever drinking human blood (except when she actually was a human of course).  She also is able to have a child, because apparently, vampires can get humans pregnant.  Well she ends up able to see Charlie in just two days after she is changed, has her rapidly aging child, who also can read to herself at age three months, and doesn't give up anything at all.  How can you appreciate a happy ending, when nothing was sacrificed to gain it?  You don't just get everything you want without doing something for it, I don't care how good your self control is.All right now this is my final rant.  I spent a lot of time trying to put my finger on the biggest thing that bothered me about the book, and came up with two.  The first one is that in all the other books, there is the underlying conflict of her staying human.  Without that, it fell flat.  The second one is that the book did not follow the structure you have to have in a book.  There is supposed to be rising action, a climax, and then falling action to a conclusion.  Well Breaking Dawn had two climaxes.  It should have been two books.  The first book should have ended when she was bitten and changed.  The second book should have been the rest.  The first climax was when she had the baby and was changed, and then there was falling action when she is having the time of her life with her baby and Edward.  Inexplicably, the action begins to rise again, when Alice leaves, Irina sees Renesmee, and the Volturi plan to come to a battle.  We were all geared up for a final battle to rival that of Eclipse, with all the other paper doll vampires staying with the Cullens.  However, that too just petered out.  There was no battle.  Bella saves everyone with her amazing power, Alice comes back, and everyone lives just too happily ever after. I have honestly found myself wishing that this was some sort of worldwide practical joke, that Stephenie Meyer released a fake copy of Breaking Dawn to get everyone all riled up.  But unfortunately that isn't going to happen.  The most anticipated book of the year turned out to be a total flop, with Stephenie Meyer writing for the money, and to please legions of fans, not herself.  How ironic that when she writes to please, it doesn't.</review>

<review id="8004">I made myself sit through a couple episodes, and felt I had pretty much just watched the O.C. in outer space. Silly, melodramatic story lines with people bickering back and forth and story lines involving pointless & avoidable human problems & arguments, kinda like the brain-dead reality shows on MTV like Real World, etc. This show gets so much hype, I wonder how many people really like it, and how many have just heard how "smart" and wonderful it is from other people and TV talking heads. Maybe yet another example of Recieved Opinion?More observations:1) Typical modern, PC/feminist infected plot...to the point that the beloved main character has been transformed into a woman. I love strong female characters. The original show had them. Why don't we make a Star Wars series, and turn Princess Leia into a man, or Chewbacca into a frog?2) The creator admittedely had never even watched the original series. This is an abomination...maybe we should tap Michael Bay to produce the next romantic comedy.3) On a positive note, the look of the series is great. All the sets & equipment are "aged" ala Star Wars, giving them a realistic look.4) The noiseless energy beams from the fighters are scientifically correct, but this loses much of the dramatic effect. Watch the chase in the first scene of Star Wars: Episode IV with no sound, and you'll see what I mean.5) I'm not saying the original series was great. They used the battle scenes from the pilot for the rest of the series, and the acting & dialogue was second-rate at best. But at least it was FUN. The new one is too whiny and serious for sci-fi (for me...if you love it, more power to you).6) I hope the new Flash Gordon (August '07, Sci Fi Channel) isn't like this. The creators have already said they're "re-amagining it" like BSG. Oh, brother. Give me the campy, fun '80 movie version.Check out the Buck Rogers series (I think '79-'81) for good effects, cheesy fun and beautiful people. And the strong-female-heroine (basically Leia clone) Wilma (Erin Gray).PS - Spare me the following posts, oh yee hyper bloggers:"You're an idiot (or other insults)" - it's just my opinion, people."Check your facts before you post" - makes you sound SO insecure."You're just not smart enough to enjoy the depth of this show" - Don't delude yourselves.</review>

<review id="8005">I purchased this product for my 13 year old daughter who had to have the latest Touch because her 8 month old 32 gig touch wasn't as slick and didn't have the external speakers.  She unboxed it started it up and everything seemed to go O.K.  We backed up her old one with iTunes and plugged in her new one.  Ran threw the little setup wizard and all seemed to go O.K.  We authorized the ipod on her account and started to restore her info onto the new one just like the instructions suggested.  Well this was a disaster, the touch rebooted and started to beep with the apple logo and the little timer lines circling.  This goes on for about 5 minutes and it restarts and performas the same thing over and over.  I put the touch into DFU mode to see if I could get it to restore nothing.  I had to bring it over to another computer download the 200 plus meg OS hook it up to my laptop and finally it started the restore procedure.  After all said and done it finally started.  Being one who must love punishment I performed the same procedure on her computer again and at last success. This took almost 90 minutes to get this done and once completed half her songs did not come accross.  I had to take her old touch and copy all of the music off using Touch Copy which allows you to take the music off of your old iPod and either copy it to your computer or directly into iTunes.  I was finally done but not sure if this is typical of all upgraded but sure was nerve racking having a 13 year old on Christmas day looking over your shoulder trying to get her new touch that well you know how it goes "you touched it so you must have broke it" working feeling. I have three daughters who are 4, 13 and 18 each have a touch I also have an iPhone so the I have a lot of experience with this kind of stuff and all I can say is have patience and the confidence and you can get though anything.</review>

<review id="8006">I purchased this camcorder to document monitoring activites in a DVD format.  It is essential to me that the time and date information is included in the final video along with the picture.  However, when the MOA and MOI files are converted, the time stamp information is lost!  I have searched diligently on the internet and have yet to find software that will include the time information.  Unless I find appropiate software for the time stamp, the camcorder is worthless for my application.  By the way, the Lenmar LIP07 accessory battery that Amazon recommends does not fit the SDR-H40 Camcorder.</review>

<review id="8007">After doing much comparison of specifications I opted for this router. That was my first mistake. While Dlink says its routers are compatible with Macs, hours of effort could not get this one to work wired to my Mac desktop and wirelessly with my MacBook. Even more infuriating is that they promote they tell you that their so-called set-up wizard that is supposed to get you up and running in minutes. Newsflash...the setup wizard CD that they include only works on PCs and Unix computers. The Mac setup requires that you log on to the Web, input their IP address and follow a series of setup screens that leave much to be desired. For example, in their "Wireless Setup Wizard," they ask if you want to set up using a PIN or a Push method but do not explain what either of those is!!! Maybe if you are already an IT PhD this is a piece of cake but for the somewhat above average home tech, this stinks. The router is going back to the store tomorrow and I will instead shell out the extra bucks for the Apple AirPort Extreme.</review>

<review id="8008">Very disappointed.   I realize complaining about a $30 item may be stupid, but I did pay shipping both ways, so I really lost about $11.00 on the deal!Toaster is horrible.  One side of toast dark to almost burned, the other side normal to not toasted.  Bottom of toast lighter than top -- reason for this:  the tongs that "grab" the toast only grab at the top, leaving the bottom to lean to one side causing toast to come out unevenly browned.  Have no idea why one side toasts darker than the other.  Would definitely NOT recommend this product.  I gave gave it an additional star (would have rated 1 star) just due to it working when plugged in!</review>

<review id="8009">Bought this item after shopping around locally.  It worked fine for about three weeks.  Heart rate readings were accuate.  After this time the readings would show wide deviations over very short periods (Drop from 130 to 80 then up to 90 then down to zero).  The instruction book indicated the battery may be low.  Purchased new battery but it still malfunctioned. All the other features work fine (clock, timer, alerts) but an accurate heart rate reading is the most essential part of the product.  Currently trying to go through the process of sending the unit back for repair. Not worth the grief.</review>

<review id="8010">As most of the other reviewers have written, this product is not worth buying.  I got a free copy as I went to the product launch, and was soon incensed that Microsoft could sell this with a straight face.Let's look at the listed "product features" one by one:1. Streamlined user interface runs natively on both Intel- and PowerPC-based Macs- Streamlined is an interesting word to use.  I never had the displeasure of using Office for Mac 2004 on my Intel Mac, but from all reports it ran terribly.  I shudder to think that this edition is supposedly running better.  The Office applications are without a doubt the slowest applications running on my Mac, and this includes Parallels which allows me to run Windows in a virtual machine.  The idea that this is "streamlined" is laughable.2. Open XML file formats, the Office Art graphics engine, and other features that result in compatibility and file fidelity- This is probably the main reason new-comers would buy Office, for compatibility with Office for Windows users.  However, the compatibility is full of problems.  Do not spend any time working on layout for your Word documents if you're then sending them to a Windows user; the layout will be completely ruined and you'll have to do it all again.  I also have Office for Windows running through Parallels, and I usually end up using that if I hope to share my documents.  Office for Mac just doesn't do it properly.  Keep in mind that Apple's Pages can read docx (some say better than Word for Mac does), although it can't write back to docx.3. Professional design is within your power with hundreds of new customizable templates and suite-wide themes, SmartArt graphics, and the new Publishing Layout View in Word 2008- This is all well and good but if you wanted great templates and layout capabilities, you would buy iWork for a quarter of the price... which is certainly my recommendation.  Did I mention the layout capabilities don't work reliably anyway?4. My Day keeps you connected to all of the day's action. Command your calendar, tackle your tasks, and simplify your day- If you own a Mac you have iCal.  Why would this be a selling point to anyone?5. Includes: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Entourage, Microsoft Server Exchange Support- And therein lies perhaps the main reason Office for Mac will still be purchase even though it is greatly inferior to competing products: Microsoft Server Exchange Support.  Apparently much of the world runs on this these days.  Let's be thankful that Google and SalesForce are teaming up to take it down once and for all...So in summary, the real reasons to buy this product are as follows:1. You are forced to require Microsoft Server Exchange Support.Err... I put a number 1 because I thought there would be more but there actually isn't.  Compatibility with Windows users is important, but Office for Mac just doesn't deliver here.  Personally I would buy iWork - did I mention it is a quarter of the price for an equivalent product?  Microsoft Office for Mac is a typical half-hearted, over-priced attempt from Microsoft, but no one can deny that their propaganda will make it a best-seller.</review>

<review id="8011">"This makes it the perfect flash drive for users with busy and active lifestyles."  FAIL.[...].Size:  small.  retracted, it's 1.5" long.Performance and compatibility:  very good.  i only use the drive for data transfer between machines.  i've never had any complaints or issues with using the drive on Windows XP, Vista, or OS X.  writes and reads are very good.  Durability and Build Quality:  this is why i'm giving the drive 2 stars.  i put this drive on my keychain and goes into my pocket everyday, and over the past 8 months, the following things have happened: 1. the original metal clasp snapped around week 3.  that was ok, since i then put the keychain directly into that rubber hole.2. the rubber is glued to the plastic unit. . .that started to pull away.   somewhere around 5 months.3. the rubber around the hole is starting to tear.  7 months.4. lastly,the biggest malfunction is retractable tip no longer locks into place.  8 months.Support: i have submitted an RMA request with Corsair, and i will update this review with my experience.Support Update (Feb 25):  I received the replacement (a new unit) yesterday after sending the defective unit.  I was a little surprised to see how 'solid' a new unit is compared to the one that I sent in.  I hope it holds up better than the old one.  I've been impressed with their responsiveness over email.  I am lucky that they are located in Fremont, so the turnaround time was very quick.  I'd give Corsair 5 stars for support.Timeline:Feb 13: Email to Corsair describing issueFeb 13: Received response, replied again using web-based form.Feb 13: Received RMA numberFeb 18: Sent defective unit ($1.00 shipping, First-Class uninsured)Feb 19: Email confirming receipt of defective unit.Feb 23: Notification of shipment of replacement via UPS GroundFeb 24: Receipt of replacement.

<review id="8012">I have been using this keyboard for about 2.5 months, and a number of the most commonly used keys are starting to "blur". It seems as though something is happening to the grey covering that's allowing more of the blue light to shine through so that the letters appeared blurred. I can't think of anything that I could be doing to cause this: My hands are clean and I don't drop/spill things on the keyboard.I just wrote Saitek and I'm sure that they'll replace the keyboard, but that means my expense in sending it to them, and I have no reason not to think it'll happen again.I note that one of the reviewers of the Eclipse II posted a photo of exactly the same thing happening to him.</review>

<review id="8013">I wanted this cologne for my mentally disabled son who is turning 18 and 2 weeks, I saw the cologne, ordered it, told him and he was excited because he was getting the same kind his uncle has.  Then I get an email from amazon that says this vender cancelled the order, no reason given.  I had to tell my son he isn't getting it for his birthday.  So I started looking at my bill and it all looks fine, everyone else I ordered from that day is sending my orders.  So I go to look at the item itself, and notice the price is much higher than what I originally paid for it.  So I think I have figured it out.  They made a mistake and sold it to me at a price they didn't want to sell it.  Now I haven't heard back from them in email, but if that was the reason.  I'm sorry, but I found it on the clearance page and I ordered it, paid for it, and now because THEY made a mistake, my son can't get it?  What kind of business is this?</review>

<review id="8014">I'm not sure if I received a defective product, but this Cuisinart waffle maker resulted in two disastrous breakfasts. First, the top of the waffle maker that lifts up is loose, making the entire contraption seem rather cheap. The control setting knob is also made of a cheap plastic, and I was never sure that is was really "locked" into a setting. And there is no sound to indicate when your waffles are done, so you just have to keep an eye on the light, which is a hassle when you're doing other things.That aside, it was the waffle preparation that was really a mess, literally. The first morning I poured in exactly the recommended amount of batter, closed the lid, and the batter gushed over the sides, spilling all over my counter and down the front of the cabinets. I left the remaining batter cooking, and when the waffle was done, lifted the lid, only to find that the waffle was hopelessy stuck to the waffle maker. No amount of prying would loosen it, so that morning my husband and I skipped the waffles. And the cleanup of the waffle maker took forever.The next morning I was determined to try again. This time I sprayed the waffle maker first with Pam; then I poured far less batter into the waffle maker. As the lid went down, once again the batter gushed over the sides. At least, though, I was able to remove this one when it was done. I then went to prepare a second waffle, this time pouring in even less batter to avoid spill-over, not even filling up all of the grid holes. The batter still spilled over a little, but not nearly as before. The only problem was that when this waffle emerged, it just looked sad -- uneven and oddly flat, which is not surprising given the small amount of batter I used. This waffle maker is the worst and will definitely be going back. I just can't deal with this kind of frustration in the morning. I'll be buying a VillaWare waffle maker instead, which will be well worth the extra cost.</review>

<review id="8015">Fine, I was pretty young when this movie came out. But I watched it again and again and again. Knew all the songs and still do. I'm sure I will know them all my life.  I do have a soft spot for "Dumbo" and "Robin Hood," but in my lifetime this is the best Disney movie ever made. And since Disney isn't making any more animated movies this may well be the last good Disney movie ever. Sorry all you Lion King and Beauty/Beast fans, they just didn't do it for me.  It's sad to witness an end to an era of creative genius but I'm glad they decided to close their animation offices rather than keep putting out things like Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. I haven't seen any of the video sequels, thank god.  Oh, and by the way, when I talk about the Disney movies made in my lifetime, I'm not counting Pixar, which I think makes great films. Unfortunately, it seems like they've left the cartoon musical behind too. I'm afraid we'll never see another movie like The Little Mermaid again.</review>

<review id="8016">Stay away from this thumb drive! My girlfriend made the mistake of buying it and everytime you plug it in, it tries to boot up its software. If there is a way of turning it off, its not easy. SanDisk should not force users to run some time-consuming software when they simply need to copy files to and from the drive.Other than that, the drive runs fine and works smoothly on Mac and PC. Hey at least on the Mac it doesn't try to run its software.</review>

<review id="8017">1. It comes packaged so securely as to be nearly impossible to open (and I should have stopped right there, given how the rest of this experience played out).2. The brush binds up, cuts on and off briefly and unpredictably while brushing.  And it does not shut off automatically at the end of the recommended 2-minute brushing period.3.  There's no way at all to SEE how long you've been brushing without turning it OFF to look since you cannot remove it from your mouth while turned on.  There's a different Oral-B product with a separate timer (the Oral-B Triumph with SmartGuide Electric Toothbrush).  But that timer cannot be purchased separately.4.  On both low and regular speed this brush shakes my head violently, enough to make me dizzy (I have to sit down to feel I am brushing safely... and can watch the clock that way, too, since the brush-based timer is of no use whatever).  5.  After only 4 uses (two more than I thought I could stand) and a consultation with my dentist, it's back in the original package and replaced with a Phillips Sonicare.  More than dismal for a "$139.99" toothbrush!6.  When I contacted Oral-B (now Crest, i.e., Procter and Gamble) they basically told me to go pound sand - actually what they suggested was since it didn't seem to suit me I should just throw it away, which they based on the production # having been 2 years ago (as though that had any bearing on its newness).In summation, Oral-B may be the recognized leader in toothBRUSHES and know all there is to know about brushes but they do not know the first thing about electronics.  I paid for their learning curve.  Never again.  Too bad NO stars isn't a rating option.</review>

<review id="8018">The initial install experience was good, and I like the form factor. Unfortunately, after less than six months, devices plugged into the hub began behaving erratically. Mouse pointers would jump all over the screen, my SmartPhone couldn't get a consistent connection to synch, etc. The same devices plugged straight into a USB port on the computer worked fine, so it was definitely the hub that went bad. It had the same power source as everything else, so it's unlikely that there was an external cause such as a power surge.I'm now shopping for another hub, and I won't be getting another one of these.</review>

<review id="8019">I have bought over 20 linksys products over the years.  (sound file player, hubs, routers, WAPs, cards, etc etc)  On about 3 I have had to call or email for a bit of support to get them working, in each case customer service was good and the product worked great.  Some maybe for only a year or 2.  This is actually my second WRT54G, I have the WRT54G version 1.1 (look at bottom of the box for your version)  This one is a version 5.I bought a high gain antenna, range expander, a usb wireless adapter and this piece of junk WRT54G version 5 router.  I have now called/chatted their service reps 5 times on this same device.  It constantly just drops.  I upgraded firmware twice, changed ip address, release/renew etc. etc. etc.  I have an MCSE and a MBA emphasis IS, there is no doubt the problem is in their product. The main reason I bought this is because of the several wireless appliances I have I hoped to use the range extender and antenna to cut through some interference and provide a better signal to a desktop that sometimes drops when some wireless cameras are on.  (the version 1.1 doesn't have antenna that can be upgraded) What a huge waste of my time.The kicker, I finally call for 6th time to say hey just give me a replacement and they try to once again make me jump through the same troubleshooting hoops for the 6th time, when I finally demand a refund/replacement they tell me to call back because their computers are down.  Linksys you have gone right to the bottom of my list for components.</review>

<review id="8020">This monitor seems to require just the right conditions to work. When I used it on an elliptical trainer (the Gazelle, whose own pulse monitor seems to show double my heart rate most of the time), it gave believable readings, not too far from ones shown on an Omron sleeve-type blood pressure monitor. But when I used it on bike rides, or just walking around, even after wetting the chest strap (not easy to do constantly when you're out in the park and its cold or you don't want to pull up your sweatshirt in public!), it gave very weird readings, when it gave any (half the time it just says zero): a rate of 67 when biking up a steep hill, and rates of 120-160 when just standing next to my bike, relaxed and admiring the views from Central Park! This happened so much I gave up and returned it.</review>

<review id="8021">The player froze up on me on its second day of use. The title screen locks up, and it stops responding. Apparently, this is a common problem. Regrettably, I didn't research this brand like I should have before making my purchase, and now I'm left with a useless object and $70 off my bank account.

<review id="8023">As with every other new Quicken annual update, Quicken 2009 Premier has been released prematurely with numerous problems! The program simply fails to download transactions from many financial institutions but gives you an erroneous online update summary that the account was successfully updated!And the technical support for Intuit products can be summarized in one word: "Nonexistant"!  Intuit has created a Quicken Community forum where everybody gripes about there non-working programs, but no solutions are offered here.  And worst of all Intuit no longer has effective telephone support! Oh yes you can email them and request a callback that will occur within thirty minutes.

<review id="8024">This review is from: Gone with the Wind (Four-Disc Collector's Edition) 1939 (DVD)      I'm a big film buff; I can assure you this is NOT the greatest movie ever made.  Overblown and overly long (even the opening credits last longer than they should!), engrossed with its own sense of enormity, not exactly true to history ("See? the slaves were actually happy!"), and much of the acting and dialogue feels dated.  But the worst aspect of this film has to be the shrill, unattractive Scarlett O'Hara.  I'm not criticizing Vivien Leigh's performance, and she is a very beautiful woman; it's just impossible to get into the movie when the protagonist is so unsympathetic and inexplicably drawn to the total cad Ashley.  I give it 2 stars; one for its importance in the history of filmmaking, and one for the hilarious and touching performance by Clark Gable, perhaps the only reason to view this film more than once.  If you really want the greatest film ever made, try Casablanca or Citizen Kane; and if you just can't live without color and BIG production values, try the much more inventive and charming The Wizard of Oz.</review>

<review id="8025">bad product ..worse tech support. I received one...did not work out of the box...or atleast that is what i was told, because tech support had no idea how to help out.

<review id="8026">I bought Turbo Tax after using Tax Cut in my last few years - Turbo tax had a better flow, better UI and more user friendly language when it comes to explaining complicated tax stuff, especially when it comes to deductions.The federal seemed fine, but when I tried to use my 529 contributions as a deduction for my State filing (UT) it just would not allow me. It does not give me any manual way to work around it, and makes the single rate tax calculation and completely avoided my 529 contributions which would have resulted in me getting 150 dollars more in my tax return.I think the e-filing fees are way expensive - and I did not get confirmation email from Turbo Tax (or Intuit) that my tax return e-file has been accepted by the IRS (the Program states that it would send an email as soon as it was accepted by the IRS). I started getting nervous after 48 hours within which the IRS guarantees the electronic confirmation and had to log in to the Intuit website to check my e-file status.Since they have a big office in Orem (in Utah) I would assume that they would have tested the Utah State return a little more. I have to go through the pain of filing an amendment and mailing it out now. The online support is non responsive, and the FAQ is minimal at best in terms of imparting info.I would avoid Turbo tax in the future, and would tell the same to anyone who seeks advise from me. I can spend the 70 bucks + some with a pro and get some peace of mind. Their idea to monetize everything while you are doing your taxes sucks.</review>

<review id="8027">This review is from: Slumdog Millionaire (DVD)      The film starts off well enough, when they were kids in the slums.  In particular were some scenes on an Indian train that reminded me of some scenes in Gandhi.  Seeing the evil people using kids to beg on the street really hit home with me, it's everywhere in China.  And it's sick.  There were also some good, funny moments during the interrogation scenes when Jamal stood up to his tormenters.But I don't think the romance worked at all.  The relationship with his brother didn't feel real at all either, it felt very tacked on.  And I found it hard to care about the main character, especially because he spends half his screen time mute, staring into space.Will he win the money and the girl or lose both.  I didn't care at all one way or the other.  I didn't find much fun in the film, and there's absolutely nothing there to think about.It really is the worst Oscars ever.</review>

<review id="8028">it's a very good netbook, i liked it very much but i ended up returning it just because it was giving me stuttering/stammering sounds... i don't know if this is the case with all asus netbooks. I will try to find one with good sounds quality.</review>

<review id="8029">I purchased this juicer after reading all of the fantastic reviews. I couldn't wait to get started. The first day; I used ingredients to make 'green lemonade.' one head of romaine lettuce, 5 stalks of kale, 1 apple and 1 lemon. True to its word; it made juuice in less than 5 seconds!! And, it was a great tasting glass of juice. I was in love with my new juicer. Day 2--exact same ingredients went in and same ingredients stayed in---very little juice extracted, wet pulp, chunky and the motor stopped working during the process. Bummer! Tried again day 3; but unfortunately, now the motor doesn't even turn on. It appears that I got the one bad apple of the barrel----this unit is clearly defective. You would think that 600+ watts would be strong enough to take on leafy greens, apples & lemons. I really liked the easy cleaning and assembly/dis-assembly of the unit. Breville has other juicers with higher watts; and since I have every intention of making fruits & vegie juices; this model may not have been a good choice for me. It does make a great glass of fresh juice when it did work the one time!</review>

<review id="8030">I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas.  We have used it three times so far trying a variety of different whole wheat type loaves, so far all three have failed to rise properly and have been burnt.  We have use other bread makers in the past, and have never had this consistent of a problem.  We have tried cutting the expensive new whole wheat flour with unbleached regular flour.  We have always use new yeast, but to no avail it seems to always come out extremely short, dense, and burned on the sides.  We did use it to make pizza dough once, and that turned out okay so that's why I didn't just give it one star.  I think the problem is in the yeast dispensing mechanism. Now since it has been use, and I bought it just over thirty days ago, I have to deal with the hassle of returning the product to Panasonic for a full refund.  Amazon is only offering a partial refund.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</review>

<review id="8031">No offense to stephenie meyer, i love her other books to death, but this one has nothing to do with the series. The sci-fi twist threw off the whole feeling of the book, what once used to evoke a desire for passion and reminiscing about first loves now leaves the reader completley pissed off. It feels like a fanfiction prototype instead of the series that we love. We request a rewrite! It feels like the publishers wrote the book instead of the brilliant authour. Where is the lust and the witty conversation, the depth of emotion? Everything you loved about the twilight series seems to have gone missing in the grand finale.</review>

<review id="8034">We bought this product about a month ago to try to deter both of our big dogs from barking all day while we were gone as well as to stop the neighbor's dog from constantly yipping.  It worked on our larger dog (great pryenese) for about a week but once he got used to it, he has been able to totally ignore it and keep on barking.  It did not work at all for our golden retriever who just barked louder!  It also had no effect on the neighbor's dog either.  I wish we would have purchased the citronella collars instead!</review>

<review id="8035">I bought this item by X'mas 08. I was very happy with it until it broke down only after 1 month of usage. The battery charging light keeps blinking even after 3.5 hours of charging. And I can no longer turn on the camcorder. Their customer service has no phone support, only email support. And their warranty is only 90 days, which they promise only to have the camcorder repaired or replace with a refurbished unit.</review>

<review id="8036">It could have been a great product.  I don't know.  After I installed the program, it downloaded the latest update, but the installation of the update failed.  If I tried to use the program, it told me certain features required program update.  I tried to install the update again, and it failed.  Again.  After a few tries, I decided it is not worth investing any more time.</review>

<review id="8039">The camera will only record 25 minutes of a movie.  Period.  Even with 8 G memory stick, plugged into wall power.  Twenty five minutes.  I set it up on a tripod to record an hour long award luncheon.  Recorded25 minutes.  This is not mentioned on the Sony or Amazon website.Should have used my miniDV tape camcorder, it runs as longas it has tape.Another design flaw is that it does not have 720 by 480 format option so that its files would match miniDV tape format used by tons of software.Tried two open source programs to convert files into something Premiere would swallow.   Handbrake (on Windows XP) crashed.  WinFF (from Google)worked.  Both programs claimed that every data block was three bytes shorter than expected.Plus the standard problem that it uses Sony memory sticks that are 3 times more expensive per gigabyte that SD or miro-SD.Avoid this product unless you just want two minutes for YouTube.</review>

<review id="8040">This item provided great range and was easy to setup and use.  But it physically breaks in two extremely easily.  That's a problem.</review>

<review id="8041">This review is from: The Shack (Special Hardcover Edition) (Hardcover)      A few weeks ago, a friend brought this book to the attention of our Bible Study. She said "Everyone one is reading it." The first cynical response that some of us had was: "Great. If everyone is reading it, then it must be bad theology."In an effort to be open-minded, however, I read the book this weekend. And I was right: bad theology. I read Tim Challis' review, afterwards and he goes into much more detail about many of the concerns I have, so I will just share a few after I share some compliments. I found myself skimming until chapter 4, then I pretty much read the book til I finished. It was fairly engrossing from that point forward. Also, I read many things which made me stop and think about God. For example, I liked the point that God may appear to us as a male in the Bible possibly to compensate for the loss of real maleness at the fall (when Adam failed to take responsibility). I also thought some of the scenes that depicted heaven were remarkable and inspiring. And I can see how many folks who don't realize they are mad at God can work through that sin, come to repentance, and start to trust Him again.But there were some things I just couldn't get past. First, it seems that this Papa version of God is not sovereign. The author often suggests that true love won't control the response to love (so this version of god sure isn't the God of Calvin and Augustine... no election here). But even if you don't agree with the doctrine of election, sovereignty sure is at stake in this book. On page 185, Papa says: "... just because I work incredible good out of unspeakable tragedies doesn't mean I orchestrate the tragedies. Don't ever assume that my using something means I caused it or that I need it to accomplish my purposes. That will only lead to false notions about me." Well, based on their writings, I guess Peter, Paul and John all had false notions about God. I'll just quote Peter from Acts 2: 23 "... you followed God's prearranged plan. With the help of lawless gentiles, you nailed [Jesus] to the cross and murdered him." Did God not orchestrate this apparent tragedy? And how about when the Lord told Satan about Job: "Do whatever you want with everything he possesses..." (Job 1:12) and thereafter Job loses all of his children, his farmhands, his livelihood. Note that for the rest of the book of Job, God is credited (or blamed) with "orchestrating" these tragedies. Moving on,there's a hint of universalism throughout the book, certainly an avoidance of punishment. On page 182, it seems that Jesus borders on saying that folks can become sons and daughters of God without necessarily going through faith in the atoning death of Christ. Papa seems to be "especially fond" of everyone, too. Are there no people who by their treasonous turning from God deserve judgment? Further, what's striking that the notion of hell and of judgment seem to be avoided. Says Papa on p. 120: "I don't need to punish people for sin. Sin is its own punishment, devouring you from the inside. It's not my purpose to punish it; its my purpose to cure it." Huh? If we won't be punished for sin, then why was Jesus punished? And what of those who never place their faith in His work on their behalf? Well, those are just a couple of my theological beefs with the book. I can see how folks from very legalistic backgrounds,those who have suffered much, and those who blame God instead of trusting Him would benefit from this book. The frightening thing is that as they benefit, they my find themselves turning to a very different God than the one portrayed in His own Word.</review>

<review id="8042">I don't question Hollywood for taking a beloved cheesy children's show and turning it into a modern remake. Remakes are all the rage these days. Unfortunately this one is way too serious for it's own good. Will I really find the answers to life's great mysteries in a serious version of a cheesy kid's show? LOL! It's all far more bleak and serious than the original, but that doesn't make it profound. Some kind of fun remake on the old show might have been entertaining. This serious take on it is often just dull. What does it mean to be alive? It means that life is too short for heavy handed nonsense like this!</review>

<review id="8043">Simply put, this product lacks speed. The blades don't move fast enought.It seems to take for ever.</review>

<review id="8044">i purchased this back in january 2007 and i am no longer able to use it.  i havent had it a year yet and it is no longer working.  after a few months of using it i had to start unplugging the power cord to it and pugging it back up before it would connect me to internet.  it loses connection very easily and when you call their customer service you have to pay them $4.00 a MINUTE just for them to help you with it.  the set up took 2 hours to complete and it quit working and they wouldnt fix it until i gave them my credit card for the $4 a minute.  very poor service from product and customer service.  i will never purchase another linksys item again.</review>

<review id="8045">Goods: it gets hot and does the job. Bads: NO WARRANTY unless it's purchased through a salon, NO thermostat (it's just on or off), WHIMPY cord, as a result, directions indicate that the cord CANNOT be wound around the device to store it, so now I have a tangled mess to deal with every time I use it.  This is NOT a good value for the price - way more "BADS" than "GOODS".  It doesn't work any better than the $30 irons I've had in the past.</review>

<review id="8046">As I  write this review of Cuisinart's Model  ICE-30BC Ice Cream maker, the first game of  the 2007 World Series Baseball  game is  underway. I am using baseball's analogy of THREE STRIKES and you're out to  summarize my rendezvous with ice cream makers.I used Cook's Illustrated's recent rankings of Ice Cream makers as a basis for my foray into home made ice cream. Strike One occurred when Kitchen Aid's  dasher/paddle did not fit my Hobart N-50 mixer (Hobart and Kitchen Aid's Professional Mixer are similar in appearance, but my Hobart dates back to 1970 and its "planetery-agitator" design was incompatible with the dasher's attachment). This unit does not  come with its own motor, but uses the Kitchen Aid Mixer to power the dasher/paddle.Strike Two resulted with Cook's Illustrated's first choice, the Krups GVS 142 model which I received; but after the first try, I had difficulty getting the lid-motor-paddle combination to attach to  the freezer bowl. Krup's customer service's analysis was the freezer bowl was warped and had to be replaced. I also did not  care for the single molded platic paddle as opposed to their previous design which consisted of two separate parts, a paddle and drive shaft. Although Amazon's photograph of  the GVS 142 model shows the two-piece paddle, Krups said the current model only  comes with the single molded paddle.In the ninth inning, with two outs, Strike Three happened with Cuisinart's ICE-30BC. It's a handsome-looking appliance, well made, and it gives the impression of being very  durable. In the one week I've had it, I made three batches of ice cream from three different sources and all  came out very satisfactory. The reason I down-rated the unit was due to its excessive noise, and I do mean excessive! In the US Army, I served with artillery units in Korea as well as in Vietnam; this  exposure to loud noise and my senior citizen age makes my  hearing pretty lousey, but the loud noise generated by the Cuisinart tipped the scale for my giving it a Two Star rating. I called Cuisinart Customer Service to  report the noise problem and suggested my report be escalated up the chain for action. I asked if they had any recommendations about the noise, and the answer was brief and to the point: RETURN IT!The noise/sound issue is even more pronounce because the unit runs at least 20-25 minutes churning the ice cream mixture, versus a food processor or mixer which runs intermittenly for a few minutes at a time.  In my case, it might be due to the particular frequencies of the sound generated by  the ice cream maker that caused my hearing discomfort. I would definitely not  have young children around when the machine is in operation. My  suggeston to  Cuisinart was to have a sound test performed on the ICE-30B model, as well as a review of its design to see if the annoying noise can be mitigated. In the Cuisinart design, the motor rotates the freezer bowl around a stationary paddle whereas in both the Krups and Kitchen Aid models, the motor rotates the paddle leaving the bowl stationary. The Krups machine was very  quiet and I  would have ordered a replacement of the same model if it had a better paddle design. Now that I've tried Cooks' three recommended models and have made Three Strikes due to one problem or another, I've decide to retire to the dugout to rethink my next step in pursuing home made ice cream. Should  I consider the old-fashioned, but reliable, hand cranked model that requires lots of  ice and salt?  Only time will  tell.</review>

<review id="8047">I too have had the bad disc/crashing on profile creation problem. The company seems clueless about it, and after getting numerous form email assuring me that my problem 'was being escalated to the next level of support who will get back to me shortly,' I called them. The tech guy there looked up my case and sleepily told me that my new disc was 'in the queue' and would be there 'uhhh...sometime middle of next week or so.'  Considering that I contacted then about this 2 weeks ago, you would think it might have been a little sooner. Their customers are NOT high priority.</review>

<review id="8048">I bought this hub so that I could easily connect and disconnect my various USB devices when coming and going with my laptop. Unfortunately, every time I come back to my desk and plug in the hub, there are always a few, seemingly random, devices that are not recognized. I have to unplug the device from the hub, wait a couple seconds, and then plug it back in again. What a pain! Unfortunately there aren't many hubs on the market with so many ports, and I don't know if any of the others perform better.</review>

<review id="8049">IT sits in my garage as its worthless. My cat is small and has a hard time making it in the box and the mess is more than a regular cat box and you best wear a mask when you roll it or the cat litter dust goes all over the place. Was very disappointed in this product</review>

<review id="8050">My cats did not like the rough edges on the comb's teeth. I have had the item for several months, rarely use it, and can't decide if I like it or not. I'm sure it works much better on dogs than it does on cats. The larger the animal, I think, the better results you will have. It just doesn't work well on small pets.</review>

<review id="8051">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      As someone who watched the Transformers cartoons back in the 80's, I had some hopes for this movie.  Alas, it turned out to be just a special effects extravaganza that interspersed crummy dialogue and stitched-together plot with combat sequences.   Sure, the cgi f/x were seamless, probably some of the best I've seen.  But the giant robots, besides Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, were indistinguishable from one another because they dripped with an excessive amount of detail.  Preserving the favorite bad and good guys from the cartoons was a nice idea, but clearly it got lost in the execution, as the studio decided to show off their computing prowess in animating a robot with a million spikes and plates sticking off of it.  The story hobbled along like the Frankenstein monster put together from pieces that barely fit into a predictable and formulaic monstrosity.  Adults, especially those nostalgic for the original Transformers shows, will hat this movie.  Kids, like kids, will love it.</review>

<review id="8052">I'm sure there are some new features that make this version worthwhile. It may even be faster at some things (though I haven't found them yet.) But Microsoft wrapped it in an inscrutable user interface that often flies in the face of logic. The "ribbon" interface is supposed to make it easier for new users to begin working, and, for all I know, it may. But for the millions of current users, it's a nightmare. A user interface is meant to help you be more productive but Office 2007's interface does the exact opposite of that. Things that took two clicks before now take four. Or, even worse, some previously available tools or functions seem to be completely unavailable. This is considered progress?I would have expected Microsoft to conduct large-scale interface usability testing before making a change this radical, or to at least offer the previous interface as a selectable option. Unfortunately, it appears that they did neither.My suggestion? Unless you're forced, stick with Office 2003. It's interface is at times clunky but it's far, far better than this.</review>

<review id="8053">I had this for about 2 months.  In that time it was great!  I used it to make shakes just about every morning.  If that had continued I'd easily give it 5 stars.  Unfortunately it didn't. A little plastic piece sheared off.  I did use things like frozen fruit in it, but their own recipes use ice so I figured that wouldn't be a problem.  But, that was apparently too much for it.It was still under warranty, but they request $10 for return shipping.  Which in addition to the estimated $8-10 of shipping that I'd have to pay to get it to them is 2/3 of the original price paid ($30 with free shipping).  So at this point it seems like a better idea to just go try a different model perhaps from a different manufacturer.</review>

<review id="8054">Attempting to work with Quicken 2009 has be extremely frustrating and a total waste of time.  There are so many bugs: bank downloads, account creating, reconciling, etc., etc..  At first I thought it was ignorance on my part, so I got a book and started reading forums.  Using the book made it clear that it was not "user error", and reading the forums proved it was not just my machine or OS (Vista) or browser or anything besides poor coding by Intuit.  Don't take my word on all this, go read the forums and you will find so many frustrated people.  Also, I have the latest update, rev. 4, and it only seemed to add more problems.  I really wish I could get my money back, but it does not look like that will be happening since all my attempts in emailing Quicken have resulted in insulting responses that only side step the problems by blaming them on me, or my PC.  Also, they keep promising new fixes coming soon.  I have been programming for 25 years, heck I started programming on an Apple IIc and a VAX, and I have never seen junk code like this.  I am thinking someone should start a class action suit...</review>

<review id="8055">I wish to GOD I would have read more reviews and product guides before buying - I am a mobile DJ that just took over a karaoke business. I figured -WHY NOT- get a TB drive to have everything I dj off of plus karaoke on one drive.HUGE MISTAKE!First off for DJ's - this is slow and more so when using the VirtualDJ program. Between songs a 15-30second lag time. That can be forgiven though as the drive itself is massive.Here is my own dilemma. I went to pick the drive up and the entire casing fell apart and the hard drive itself fell out! I had a friend who took it and put it in his own computer as a secondary drive to retrieve files. He rendered the whole thing useless and broken. Perhaps I got a defective one but that doesnt help me now.I have DJ'ed with this drive a mere 3 times and used it maybe 10 times for transfers so its brand new! It is going back to the store for me to find something better which I will be reading reviews for the rest of the night.As for now - Thank GOD I had all the DJ music backed up on my wife's laptop and a 160gig seagate. I have lost the karaoke job at the bar for now all because of a very faulty product!Buy and use only at your own risk!</review>

<review id="8056">Do Not Purchase this item!  It is awful and not worth the ridiculous price.  It seems very cool from the description, but it is a piece of junk.The grind area is very difficult to disassemble, making it nearly impossible to keep clean.  Note that it must be cleaned regularly to keep it from becoming clogged.The is poorly designed.  The last cup or two are difficult to poor from the pot because it must be tipped nearly upside down to properly drain.Stay away from this product.  We have two friends that have already thrown it away.  Unfortunately, it is a common item on gift registries - leave it off!</review>

<review id="8057">I have an average beard, and this razor did a great job on my actual face.  The problem was that it just wouldn't pick up the hairs under my jaw and on my neck, even after a month.  I finally returned the razor to Braun since I kept having to shave with a regular razor afterwards anyway.  Most people seem to have a positive experience, so I would still recommend others try it.  I was just one of the few for which it didn't work so well.</review>

<review id="8058">I was a fan from the beginning. I loved Twilight. I read it before it got big. I didn't like New Moon as much when I read it and Eclipse put a damper on my spirit. The books have just gone downhill for me personally and so I can never really say that I was a "big" fan. In hopes that the final book, Breaking Dawn, would revive this series back to life it did exactly the opposite. I can really and truly see now why exactly fans are so disappointed. Yes, many like the book and I won't argue with you. I have a friend that liked it but that's her opinion and I respect it. I have mine too. I did not like the book. To put it simply, this book was indeed a cheese fest. And so, with the rest of this review (yes there's more), I will say as a forewarning to those that take offense from bad reviews, to not read any more if they don't want to be offended. And so, I will start with the CONS, because it's good to get the bad stuff out of the way first. WARNING - SPOILERSLet me add first, as a sort of forward to the cons, that I do NOT believe in these books as sending off any sort of "message" to its readers. And NO I do not believe in Bella being any kind of example for teenage girls nor the relationship between Edward and Bella. These, to me, are strictly fantasy. This is a work of FICTION, therefore people should be able to distinguish fantasy from reality. If you can't do that then you more than likely need help.CONS for the book Breaking Dawn:-Confusing part about Charlie. After Jacob "phased" in front of Charlie he told him to go see Bella. There's some really weird saying that he keeps saying and it's driving me nuts. "Need to know." What exactly is that supposed to mean? It never explains what exactly Charlie is so confused about, which makes the whole scene, or rather chapter, confusing for the reader. "Need to know." I don't get it.-Emmett's stupid jokes about Bella's apparently "tame" sex (in which they arm wrestle over and it's completely stupid and unnecessary). The part is cheesy and it's just like, all of a sudden that Emmett starts bugging Bella about her and Edward's sex lives. -Meyer's usage of the vampires "lunging" or "leaping" or explaining them doing things impossible to imagine is another cheesy element in this book. I really don't remember them doing things like this in the previous books. At least not as vividly. She just does it SO much in this book that it's so dumb. I rolled my eyes every time I read about one of them "leaping across the river" or doing odd things such as "snarling". I'm sorry but every time she describes them as snarling I just imagine them as dogs. Just the way that Meyer describes their movements and such, it's just hard to imagine and the way that I image it makes them look retarded. Don't know if she intended that..-Jacob becomes a nuisance by staying with the Cullens. Imprinting is a big change but it's like it changed his whole personality. Needless to say, he went from smart to stupid and tolerant to annoying.-Edward's "frozen" state of "shock" when Bella tells him she's pregnant. Come on, you're THAT shocked? You're going to make your wife feel THAT bad by sitting on the floor?-It's stupid, (and oh so coincidental!) that the woman that came to the island to clean knew something about Edward being a vampire and Bella carrying some kind of succubus or something. That was TOO much. It made everything so unrealistic and corny. Out of all the cleaning ladies in the world, they just happened to come across one that knew who he was. -It's SOOOO, a MILLION time SO STUPID that they had to have people come out to the island to CLEAN their room for them. It was just feathers! They couldn't have cleaned it themselves? Jeez they make shredded pillows out to be like spilt paint and garbage all over a bed and carpet. -I didn't understand why the Cullens had Bella in the living room when she was pregnant. Clearly, if she was in that much danger of dying then wouldn't they have her on a bed upstairs or something? Laying down out of the way? It's like their lives revolve around the living room.-When Bella is literally dying on the table Nessie bites her and Edward is like "No Renesmee". Jacob said it sounded as if he was trying to teach it manners. Huh? What the heck? Why would you do that when your wife is dying on the table?-It's clear that they cut open Bella's stomach to get out Nessie but there's no mention of any scars or her being sewn up.-Edward and Bella seem to switch personalities in the beginning. Edward acts all emo and Bella is all "positive". -Why does Bella like eggs so much? You'd think that, as many days as she ate eggs on the island, that she wouldn't want anymore but no! She wanted them when the Cullens asked her what she wanted to eat when she was pregnant.-How do Edward and Bella intend on keeping Charlie in their lives yet at the same time not grow older? BIG fat question mark.-If Nessie grows to be over a hundred years old and stays looking young then what about Jacob? Doesn't he grow old?-The whole "lets send all the vampires to the Cullens house" thing is just..sort of cheesy. I don't know. There were TOO many people to remember and many that were thrown in there for the sanctity of the plot.-The Volturi "fight" scene was so incredibly drawn out and cheesy. They all act so stupid. A bunch of flat characters to make a fight scene that never happens.-Jacob's character changes so much dramatically that it's annoying. I actually liked him at first.-Why is Esme even in this book or any of the books? Seriously, she's just there as a background character and as a mom for the family. Bella never seems to ever engage in any conversation with her. As a matter of fact, no one does.-The ending is so cheesy.. "Oh Bella I can hear you now!" Come on. Just shut up, get in the bed, and live your merry lives as eternal vampires. -It's really hard picturing the wolves as huge as Meyer describes them. In the book she pretty much says that Bella "stands on her toes" to whisper in Jacob's ear. Come on. The wolves are THAT big? I don't think so. Of course, with all the events that happened in the book I suppose everything is possible with Meyer.-At the pace that the books have been, what with there being as LITTLE supernatural elements arising as possible and as much realistic qualities as possible, more supernatural events began happening in this last one. It just got stupid, a little weird, and unrealistic for the PLOT, for the previous BOOKS. Isn't that something? It's almost as if these books had a limit on what could happen. Then things like the Volturi and immortal children were poured in, many randomly. -The little girl, Claire, that Quil imprinted on was just annoying. Could Meyer have made the toddler speech any more annoying? Probably not.-Renesmee. It was so ANNOYING to read about a little girl just jumping "15 feet" into the air and talking like an adult. I really thought it was dumb.-In this last book, in this last conclusion, all the cheesiness of the other books, with the exception of Twilight, is drawn together to make one big, fat, heaping pile of a cheese fest that I have ever read.PROS (forgot there was any?)-I will say that I did like the first half of the book. I liked Book 1 Bella and part of Book 2 Jacob. After Jacob's book I liked Bella's 3rd book UNTIL chapter 25. After Jacob told Charlie it all went downhill for me. So much, that I was literally groaning at how terrible it was. But I forgot, this is about the pros.-I honestly liked the honeymoon part. The way that Meyer described Bella as before she and Edward had sex was realistic. I just thought that it was a good way to describe how one feels before making a big decision like that, and feeling hesitant and scared.-I did sort of like the idea of them having a baby. Unpredictable and good. Until a certain point..-That the book, no the series, finally ended.-Not much else to say..As the conclusion to Meyer's books, I must say that I never intend on reading them again, EXCEPT for Twilight. The very first book that captivated us all. To me, that's where it should have ended and honestly, for me, that IS where it ends. I don't hate Meyer and I don't "hate" the series. I was disappointed but it's just a book. You read it, make your opinion, and move on. It's a good way to let all the obsessed fans, or ex-fans, know that there are other books out there waiting to be read. To not dwell on this series.</review>

<review id="8059">This is a terrific DVD tour of our world, if you have a very short attention span.  The clips are too short and too disjointed, in my view.  My kids loved it.  But, they have ADHD!  I found the jumps from topic to topic irritating and dread the kids saying, "can we see the next disc?"</review>

<review id="8061">David Allen ought to know his audience. We're too busy to read a 267 page book about organizing our life!For the busy people, here's my summary:PRO: Good, but not revolutionary, ideas. Well organized.CON: Too long. Repetitive.FOR THOSE WHO HAVE MORE TIME:I raced through it and found that the editor was asleep on the job. This book, which has great ideas, was way too verbose. A 100-page version would be much more effective. If the publisher didn't feel it was meaty enough, then they could just boost the small font size that they use. Even better, it could just be a long article. If you want to save yourself some money, just read some of the reviews on Amazon and you'll get the point of this 267 page book. Allen bangs home the same points in three different ways. Even though I was skimming, I kept feeling that I was reading the same points over and over again. Fortunately, the book uses headers everywhere, so it's easy to skim. I would glance at a header and think, "Got it. Next." That would be bad if a book about organization was poorly organized. Nevertheless, it's not succinct. When will time management gurus realize that their audience needs a thin book packed with useful info, rather than a thick one with the good info spread out?</review>

<review id="8063">Yesterday, I bought Linksys WRT54G. But, right now, I am using my old wired SMC router to write this review. Why? SINCE Linksys WRT54G. ONLY PARTIALLY WORKS!!! I could only use Linksys WRT54G to access some websites successfully (Cnet, yahoo...), but I could not access Ebay, Amazon. I called tech support today, they said I should not upgrade the latest Firmware Version: 2.04.4 which had some bugs and he would email the previous version, let me install it to rid these accessing problems. I have not received an email from tech support, so, now I am not sure whether the old firmware will work or not.  I am frustrated; I don't expect Linksys does not fully test its firmware before releasing it. I am thinking to cling to SMC product again, and return this BAD product to Linksys. I have no problem now using this now, after exchanging a new one. DONˇT TOUCH THE FIRMWARE, IF YOUR DEVICE IS WORKING FINE.</review>

<review id="8064">I thought this was going to be a nice hub, but after about a month, I noticed devices were not registering on the computer. I investigated and found that the main port of the USB cable (the one from hub to computer) was very loose, wiggled around and was not creating a connection. In fact, the whole silver panel on that side was loose. When I moved the connector around, it had an intermittent connection (USB drive light kept going on and off), then it rebooted my computer.I'll try something else.</review>

<review id="8065">My big problem with Stephenie Meyer's writing is how weird it is - I don't mean the subject matter, with which she has done some very interesting and even innovative things, so much as how febrile imaginings take the place of actual plot and suspense; and narrative tension to move the story forward; and endings in which there are shocks and surprises, and actual twists and turns, rather than mere simplistic resolution (they were there at the right time! or, everyone agreed!) I loved the imagining of the vampire condition. The big surprise of the pregnancy - the surprise to the reader, that is - the birth sequence (terrific) and the transformation from human to vampire (terrific) -- all of that was gripping. But there are great longeurs in this novel, as there were in the first (I skipped the middle novels), and it seems to me Ms Meyer has had great  success before she was required to develop as a writer. Or maybe it is so, that she has developed as a writer to a fine degree in some areas, and to a poor degree in others. It's quite intriguing. Maybe the point is that ultimately it's a romance novel, and the heroine is there to be adored, and the reader is to be supplied with an escapist fantasy of being desired to the point of insanity,  and fought over. I really enjoyed this in places, though I sped-read most of it. I admire the work as an achievement. But ultimately I'm just kind of puzzled.</review>

<review id="8066">This may be a great product for some, but it didn't work for us. I put the collar on my barks-a-lot 1 year old puppy and within minutes he barked -- the collar prayed the citronella and the dog was confused, he barked at the mist and collar went off again. This continued, followed by much coughing and gagging. At the time, I was dealing with HORRIBLE morning sickness coupled with allergies and found that after the citronella was sprayed all over the house, I was running for the bathroom getting sick from the smell. Later that afternoon, I went to pet my puppy as he was being a good boy. I scratched the side of his neck under his ear (favorite spot) and thought it should be far enough away from the sensors but that still triggered the collar again and I got sprayed in the face. After that I spent the rest of the day sick in bed :( Love that morning sickness! Later in the evening, the puppy got down on his favorite rug, rolled around and the collar went off, he got up and shook after a nap flopping his hears and the collar went off. After that, the puppy scratched his ear with his hind foot and the collar went off again. That night... mommy took his collar off -- forever.  The puppy was happy and mommy felt better :)Food for thought. Our dog trainer was very concerned that we had chosen a "bark collar." She says it's better to just have a remote operated training collar that you control. You want your dog to give at least one warning bark in case there is something wrong (intruder/danger). After all there is a reason dogs bark, to communicate. With a remote operated collar, you can control the EXCESSIVE barking. I'm buying one of those remote shock collars now. Tried one on myself, not much more than a static shock you get from your clothes in the winter.</review>

<review id="8067">The juicer itself is a great investment. Nothing bad to say about it. But Amazon has lost a big spending customer today! I purchased this juicer under the assumption it was being offered under a 6 month deferred payment if you use your Amazon.com card. Apparently I was wrong! Correction, it had to be an Amazon store card. I never new there was a difference and it wasn't as nicely explained on the site as it was to me over the phone when I called Amazon. Now instead of paying this off for the next 6 months, I have to go over my budget and pay it in full NOW! Amazon refuses to take any responsibilty for its lacking info in the offer, at the least! They have lost a loyal customer. Never will I buy from them again! The juicer gets 5 stars! Amazon gets 0!</review>

<review id="8068">I have been baking bread a long time, sometimes by hand but bread machines are a great alternative. I have had 3 machines, this one is the worst AND the most expensive!! PROS: very quiet, two dough hooks.  CONS: 1.)only 3 settings, white, wheat and dough. 2.)rising cycles are too short to allow bread to ferment, rise and shape properly. result is flat bread that is as dense as if you had dipped it in cement. you can program your own times, but you will have to guess what works for this machine and that will mean a lot of lost time, frustration and wasted food ingredients 3.)no extras drop in feature, you have to be present when the beep sounds to add nuts, raisins, which defeats the purpose of "set it and forget it" 4.) instructions are in a poorly translated English manual that does not always make sense (e.g. "add flour and liquids respectably" yes, I know what they meant, but it is like finding the coffee stain on your airline seat tray table--makes you wonder where else they cut a corner) 5.it takes up to 50 minutes to warm up! this brings your bread baking time to almost 5 hours!! ridiculous! 6. the video is wierd, making a big deal about the meatloaf recipe. 7. very expensive 8. and most significantly, it did not make edible bread! I have had inexpensive machines and worked my way up to the alleged top of the line but had better results with the off brand cheap model.  I returned this machine and went to Target and got the Breadman Ultimate-- $99.00Breadman TR2500BC Ultimate Plus 2-Pound Stainless-Steel Convection Breadmaker. this is a much better machine.  I bought the Zo because The Bakers Catalog raves about it.  I did not have a defective machine,it was working as designed-- very poorly. Another alternative is to use a food processor and this GREAT book: The Best Bread Ever: Great Homemade Bread Using your Food Processor I have never had a bad bread outcome using Van Over's book. The only positive thing I can say about Zojirushi is they make the best rice cooker I have used.</review>

<review id="8069">So, I guess that consistency, logic and entertainment were out of the question, then?  I was never a rabid fan of this series. Seriously. Why? Because, let's be honest, they're not, and never were, well-written. It has always felt like a fan fiction to me. The way the books are written in first person, the way the main character is proclaimed to be (not really ever BEING it, though) and the way every single character acts around her, always made me feel like an intruder in Stephenie Meyer's deep wet fantasies. And yes, I noticed. I noticed how you were supposed to insert yourself in Isabella's shoes (ahah!) to make it your OWN fantasy. Durr, I see what you did thar!!     "Why did you read it then, stoopid?" - you might ask.  Well, I might answer, though they were never the great books they were hyped out to be, and Meyer still isn't the best writer evah (not even the greatest storyteller, in my opinion) and these series is not (or should not be) best-selling material, they were fairly entertaining. They were simple, entertaining, simple and entertaining. That's it. A good escape read. So yes, I kept reading them; if only so that I could get some closure on the story and the complete set of the series (I hate incomplete series on my bookshelf).   My opinion never changed, though. It only grew stronger and became more and more confirmed by Meyer herself with each new book. I don't hate the author. I just don't think she deserves this much attention. I mean it. Her writing doesn't even sound to me as a college literature graduated one. These books are only successful because a LOT of teenage girls and bored housewives lived through Meyer's fantasy as their own: a simple, regular girl (*ahem* you!) draws the attention of hot, mysterious, popular and rich guy. Not only that but she's the ONLY one he ever got interested in (in 107 years! Really?! Talk about dead hormones and some serious sex issues!) AND everyone seems to love you AND you get some action in your life, during which you can play damsel in distress (over and over and over and over again!) and be saved by hot guy, ALWAYS. YAY! Fantasy fulfilling time!   Twilight was, when compared to the others, good. The best of the series, I think. Maybe that's because it is the beginning and as so, it didn't ask so much for all those pesky things like: consistent characterization, character development and continuity. Then, the other books needed it much more. Oh noes! New Moon was bo-ring. And honestly, annoying. With all the Romeo and Juliet pseudo-crap! Bella showed herself as being even weaker, needier, dumber and more pathetic than previously. I don't think I ever saw a character go back in development before but, alas, she did. And Edward too. I didn't find it endearing that he tried to kill himself. Nor did I find attractive that Jacob was all around the place moping for Bella. Can you spell pathetic? As in, the most pathetic, needy and weak characters' cast in the history of ever? Eclipse just accentuated that so much more. Is there anyone with a personality in here, somewhere? And a strong one at that? Why can't, any of the main three characters, really stand up for themselves (and for the right reasons), grow a spine and stop being so damn miserable? Why can't they just grow and be strong and go away from what's hurting them? These characters and their interactions with each other remind more of a bunch of drug addicts and their drugs. Because Meyer's characters are addicted to each other.  Breaking Dawn just delved deeper and deeper into the waters of mediocrity. Its continuity with the other books is zero. Everything that produced even the tiniest spark of thought in my brain on the other books was totally erased, stepped on and vomited by Bella in this thing. Serves me right for trying to think at all about the previous themes of choice, sacrifice and consequence. How dare I, trying to take something actually meaningful from this series...  Breaking Dawn was worse because it made me laugh when I don't think I was supposed to. Also, it reached new degrees of disgusting, all in the wrong places. It was so uninteresting; it was painful to read sometimes. Never before had I ever had to force myself to keep turning pages. It was also way too long. How can anyone say so much about nothing, I will never know. I seriously doubt this was edited at all. Heck, I almost doubt even Meyer herself read it more than once. Grammatical mistakes, bad and sloppy writing, obvious OOCness, all mistakes that can NOT be in a best selling product. Heavy chunks and entire sections could and should be erased. My biologist's heart weeps for all those poor innocent trees. IF an editor looked at this thing I would like to meet this person and ask him/her what the hell...?! And also what were you high on, because it must be good. It's the final book in a best-selling series, yet it's extremely and amazingly amateurish. All the bad choices were taken. Not to mention that it's a YA romance novel that it's neither YA nor romantic. Meyer says she never wrote a YA book in her life. Really?? Well, my darling, then either you're not the one writing this or someone doesn't know what the hell they're doing. Because they are being sold as much, so you have to write to YA. Not the case with this book.The Positive:-Leah and Seth ruled! They were fun and interesting and had a personality.-Jacob also ruled until the sad, sad end.-Jacob's chapter titles actually made me smile.-The final scene with Edward and Bella because it was the only shadow of romance and the only bit in the entire lengthy book where they were like their previous selves. AND maybe by entering her mind Eddie will finally understand how boring Bella is. Take that, Edwarckle! Yeah, I had to put up with that for four books! And you'll have to put up with her for eternity! Ahah! Not to mention it was the final scene!The Negative:-Everything freaking else.Now, on to the marvellous piece of WTF known as "plot". The wedding was... meh. Short, uninspired and under described. The honeymoon was an unsexy joke. I did stop finding it funny when she started begging for sex. Way to go Bells, I guess dignity isn't in your dictionary. And the sex was... also meh. THAT was what everyone's been waiting for?! Thanks, Steph, I could barely contain myself with all the burning passion, desire and sensuality of that. When childish kisses and innocent holding are more sensual than the actual making of the love, you know you are in for one long crappy romance. The pregnancy was the biggest ridiculousness in the entire life of ridiculous. OMFGWTF?! I don't even care about the impossibility of it all, but as soon as she started with all the chromosomal mumbo-jumbo, a lonely tear of anger made its way out of my biologist's eye. It was sad, all that ignorance. Leave science out of it, damn it! Darwin actually rolled on his deathbed. Jacob's book was a bunch of wah wah wah wah wah wah, but as I already noted, Leah and Seth were cool. I was annoyed that Jake had to go back to selfish Bella and more so with Edward just giving her away for sex. Well, I guess I would want to give her away too. But I actually enjoyed understanding Jacob better because he was cool (until the sad, sad end) and I love his sarcasm! I don't love that he loves Beauty Swan. I wish Leah would've smashed the crap out of her instead of just making her cry, but oh well. I was rooting and cheering for Leah all the way! Seriously, it was about time that someone told Bella how lame and selfish and unbearable she is.  Now, the birth scene. Can you say YUCK? I actually felt nauseated! Gross! Was that really necessary? Oh, and the ripping uterus with teeth thing? So romantic! Way to go, Meyer, you destroyed the last shred of hotness that Edwarckle might've still had at this point. Eww! "Fountain of blood" ... I was prepared to vomit a fountain of actual vomit! And then, after all that, we're supposed to just love cutey pie Renesmee?! She's NOT adorable, she's freaky and creepy. Oh, and the loving scene when a mother holds her child in her arms for the first time? Nope, the creepo mutant alien thingy just bite her! Oh, predator, where are you?The transformation was a disappointment. The vampire Bella was a disappointment. Of course she is the most beautiful, graceful, controlled, perfect vampire ever! Wow, Steph, another opportunity for character development completely destroyed. The transformation and the newborn phase, had they been made correctly, could've been a great time for struggle and pain and development of depth to both Bella and Edward alone, not to mention it was perfect to mature and take their relationship to a higher level of depth and connection. But, no. Just throw that away! The only thing that was done was make Bella even more annoying and perfect. Oh, and of course she had to have a power. A lame one, but still. Was I the only one waiting for a romantic, passionate but still difficult scene between Edward and Bella? One when he would actually bite her?Oh, and the motherly and fatherly vibes that I got from Renesfreaky's parents were just amazing. I wish Edward and Bella would adopt me so I could be conveniently passed on to Rosalie and Jacob whenever they wanted to get it on - vampire style!The imprinting ... God! I don't even want to go there. Again, another opportunity for growth and development for Jacob completely raped and chewed on. Wouldn't it be great if he just resisted the imprinting crap thing? And actually fell in love? Remember all his talk about not wanting to give up on his free will? Yeah, she basically just stepped over it, shred it to pieces and set it on fire. Because, you know, who wants to have freedom, anyway? Not to mention how severely disturbing it is that he imprinted on the child of his former target of obsession. AND the fact that the thing is still an infant. Well, he's just going to have to raise it until it's ready! ARGH!  The new vampires were more of the same wah wah wah. And useless one, for that matter. The battle was the most epic non-battle that I have ever not-read. It was just disappointing. I only wanted for someone to die (and, please, Irina-whoever does NOT count)! Or at least suffer a little bit! God forbid, Stephenie, God forbid there's actually some sacrifice or pain or struggle. It was lame and *yawn*. The cheesy happy ending was the saddest of all happy endings ever. Yes, absolutely EVERYONE got EVERYTHING without giving up ANYTHING. No one deserved it. No one. It was all so sparkly and happy, with rainbows and unicorns, all so sweet and candy that I think I got diabetes by just reading it.Now, the characters. Are you expecting to find any of the ones you met in the earlier books? Well, stop deceiving yourself, because you are not going to find them here. They're simply gone. Bella has got to be the most annoying main character ever. And I refuse to use the word "heroine" because she just isn't. She's whiny; she's selfish, immature and embarrassingly weak and needy. I just can't understand why everyone, including Edward and Jacob, love her so much. It's amazing, though, that without many qualities and so many faults she still manages to be the perfect Mary-Sue. She's the sparkliest, most beautiful, perfect and most special and purest snowflake you can find. If sparkly, beautiful, perfect, special and pure snowflakes had a name it would be Bella. For now on, every time it snows, I'll just call it "snowbells". It makes me sick.Edward was reduced to a pathetic shell of self hatred, hidden in a pool of his own miserable impossible tears. Not sexy, at all! Maybe it's just my Latin-Oriental roots talking, but really, cold and hard marble who just weeps in misery without stepping up and taking action just isn't my type. I don't want a man who just gives me what I want blindly and gives in to my every whim; I want one who can give me what I NEED and who can step up against me when necessary. Well, I guess I just find strong personalities hotter, it's a matter of taste.  Jacob was the ONLY developed character in this series. He actually had a personality, and a fun one! Ironically, he's the one character that Meyer wasn't planning on developing. Whoops! Well, he got butchered on the end with the imprinting thing and is now stuck to Bella and Renespooky for eternity so... I guess he got what he deserved for having depth.Renesmee... I think we're supposed to love her. Aren't we? I just love mutant babies that grow with repulsing speed, are born with teeth, chew their way out of mommy, drink blood and read. Such cuties. Again, I cannot understand why everyone loves her so damn much. I guess the Sueish gene runs in the family. She got that from her mommy.Leah and Seth were awesome. Too bad they were not even considered for development. Leah just... well, stayed there, I guess. She was developing a good, real relationship with Jacob but then ... Puff! Sucks to be you, Leah! Maybe if Meyer had inserted herself in your shoes she wouldn't have to do this.The Cullens weren't there. Period. And when they were, they were so out of character it actually gave me physical pain. I don't even remember reading Esme's name, except in that idiot island's one.The humans are just GONE. Minus Charlie, but after what she did to him, I wish she would've just lost him somewhere like she did to Renee, Jessica, Angela, Mike and Ben. Because, you know, humans just aren't good enough to be in this dazzling book.The Vulturi ... Oh Mother of God. In conclusion, it was a mess. A big, sloppy, illogical, unprofessional, uninteresting and unedited mess. I won't even go into all the messages and innuendos out there because honestly I don't even know if she understands them herself. And I'm tired of talking about this.Read it if you must, but borrow from someone or get it from the library. I am sorry for the lengthy review but hey, Meyer does it lengthy - ALWAYS - and somehow it seems to be working for her.</review>

<review id="8070">After reviewing several router options I have chosen the WRT160N as my new router, actually my main point was to use the DD-WRT firmware with it, partly following several reviews here below and from several forum.Once I received this router I tried to work with the CD provided but it had a problem to run.No problem, I had installed some routers in my life and this one didn't take more the 10min to install including wireless configurations.immediately after installation I saw that I can't upgrade my firmware as this is WRT160Nv2 and it apparently uses "Ralink" CPU and not "BROADCOM" cpu - Ralink is not supported yet in open FW due to licensing :(In addition, it appears that there is degrading in memory capacity in the versions of the routers that goes by WRT160N!V1 - 32mbV1.1 - 16mbV2 - 8mbEven more annoying, Linksys do not have a web page for any version other than for v1!Although I didn't get the actual product I thought I am buying, I started using the wireless with my laptop while my desktop was connected to one of the LAN ports, the results:1) P2P software causes network disconnects (probably due to the fact linksys reduced the memory to 8MB only), I had to minimize the software configuration in order to stop the disconnects.2)Signal strength is ridiculous as it doesn't cover all my apartment which is not big. - Update: I got some configuration advise from Linksys support to improve the signle:Change the Beacon Interval to 50Change the Fragmentation Threshold to 2304.Change the RTS Threshold to 2304- It increased the signal strength... I do not like this solution, as my apartment is small the defaults should have sufficed.I might return this product to Amazon and replace it with a different wireless router.Based on all other reviews, I am pretty sure that WRT160N V1 is a solid router (Good hardware & FW can be replaced) - if you order this one, make sure you don't get version 2 (at least until Linksys will have a webpage for it with new FW)</review>

<review id="8074">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      Maybe I'm being stuffy, maybe I'm out of touch now that I'm an old lady of 28.  But I generally like quality young adult fantasies, and I liked the original book a lot.What got me about this one, like others have mentioned, was Bella's inability to function without her boyfriend, and later without a man in general.  Like Charlie told her, she's not the first one to have gone through a break-up or have her heart broken.  I wish she would have just sucked it up, gone on with her life, maybe gotten ANGRY with Edward for being such a drama queen.  Instead it's wah, wah, wah, I've lost everything.  Even though I have a home, two parents who love me, friends who are willing to support me even though I dropped them to be with a guy...none of it means anything because my true wuv, my high school boyfriend of one year, is gone.  Boo-friggin' hoo, Bella.  Her identity is so wrapped up in her boyfriend that her conscience speaks in his voice.  Gag me.Then, naturally, the only person to pull her out of her depression is another boy, and naturally she can't just tell him she ISN'T INTERESTED before things spin out of control.  She thinks she's ready to become a vampire, but she can't break it off with a dude.  It just bothered me.  All that aside, I liked the parts where Bella wasn't moping!  :)</review>

<review id="8075">When Fry was told, "You're the only one who can save the universe," he replied, "I get that a lot."  This was nothing but a nearly line-by-line replay of a previous 20-minute episode, with lots of padding, mostly consisting of extremely unfunny set-pieces. No continuity with previous episodes, characters acted completely out of character, Bender was completely wasted, and Fry and Leila? Hermes and Zoidberg make a more convincing couple.</review>

<review id="8076">I do not understand how this product contiues to get such great reviews.  I fly small general aviation aircraft and these rudder pedals do not even come close to the real thing.  The pedals have no feel to them and they do not have any method of adjusting the resistance.  I had to adjust them so that their response was not linear just so they would operate in a reasonable fashion.  I do not know if its the pedals or the flight model for the Cessna 172 in both Fs9 and Fs 10, but I am unable to perform a adequate forward or side slip. I've tried adjusting them, and that does seem to help some, but my biggest complaint is that they have not resistance to them.</review>

<review id="8077">Turbo Thief" I have been a TT user for 15 years and a beta tester several times. The product itself is pretty good but the greed at Intuit is unbearable. In 2005, TT eliminated the free e-file coupon and raised the price. Now in 2008, TT again raises the price, charges for 1 e-file (weather you use it or not) and limits the number of returns to only 1. At half the current price, the product would be expensive. Now the cost is outright obscene. I couldn't possibly recommend TurboTax anymore. I have read all the negative recommendations and blog posts here on Amazon and think "Larry" sums them all up.. "A name change is in order for this product now. It should be called 'Turbo-Thievery'."</review>

<review id="8078">It just didn't provide a consistent enough reading.  It gave me a general idea of what my heart rate was, but sometimes it would jump around and once it said that my HR was around 100 for a minute or two when I know it was more like 160-170.  I was prepared for this to happen, since other reviewers noted this flaw, but it was worth a shot for the price.  If you aren't particular about the reading consistency and just want something cheap, this might work for you.  I found it to be somewhat frustrating.</review>

<review id="8080">This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      I know a lot of people apparently like this movie, but I particularly didn't enjoy this. The story just seemed kind of bland to me. The world gets shot to hell and we have to live in space as fat people that can't do anything, and the only hope for our survival is a robot that has a plant. No offense here, but the whole movie seems kind of soulless to me. WALL-E, by the reference of the protagonist, is meant to just clean up trash his whole life for 700 years. What were we doing in space for that long without even bothering to send anything down to earth to investigate the Robot's progress? Why wait that long until you decide "Hey, maybe we should check and see how our home is doing?" Did it ever occur to anyone that at some point in time, you should have checked sooner before you became gelatinous blobs stuck in floating chairs? To show that I do not hate Disney movies, I have to say that "Bolt" was a far better movie than this. Disney was able to pull off something amazing without Pixar and I was extremely impressed with the results. Sure "WALL-E" will probably get into the nomination for "Best Animated Feature" on the Academy Awards, but it most definitely does not deserve to win. "Bolt" or "Kung Fu Panda" deserves to win it. Show the world that Disney and Pixar's tag team is not the only company capable of making award winning movies. Dreamworks and Disney by itself are fully capable.</review>

<review id="8081">This product will seemingly work fine until a few years go by and you start getting multiple bills from the government saying that the files were not submitted properly and that you now owe additional money. My wife and I used this program in 2004. Everything seemingly went the way it was supposed to. We filed, got our return back and thought that was that. Then in 2005 we received a bill for almost twice what our original return was because the Turbo Tax software failed to calculate certain values we had entered into the application. Then again in 2006 we received another bill from the 2004 filing that stated we had not filed properly as individuals. These are all issues Turbo Tax will supposedly file for you when you finalize your federal & state taxes within its application but did not for us. Then when you call Turbo Tax to let them know that their software costs you a couple thousand dollars they will look in the system and say that there is no way to prove that it was a software error and not a user error and you get stuck with the bill. So heed my advice and pay for an actual accountant. That way if anything goes wrong it is on them and you can enjoy your return without having to worry about the government coming back for it next year.</review>

<review id="8082">I bought this as an upgrade from my D-Link DI-524. This was the first mistake. The software requires you to disconnect (2 computers and 3 gaming systems) from your current router and be directly connected to the modem. So I had to now manually add a connection to Verizon. Why you ask? So it could connect to the internet to check my connection and for me to install their software to properly configure the router. Why would I disconnect from a perfectly working connection? So I did all that, and started to install. It took 3 restarts of my modem before the CD/SOFTWARE found a connection, not IE or firefox. When that was done, the software then asked you to hook up the new router. So I plug that in and then proceed with the software to "configure" the router. That did not work either. It took 4 reboots of the cable modem and 7 of the new router. So far, this new DIR-516 is off to a terrible start. After an hour I finally got it to work. Did I mention that I work in IT for a living? It would have been easier to just swap out the router, put in the IP address and configure. That would have taken less than 3 minutes. Anyway, back to this setup saga. The internet worked for 3 minutes. Then no pages would load, dropped connections, etc. The only good thing I've found with this router is that the wireless signal is strong. Do not buy this product. It is not worth the headache. I have great luck in the past but D-Link dropped the ball with this one. Definitely returning this awful product.</review>

<review id="8083">I've owned two of these now--trust me, they aren't well made and you can't count on it working.  The software that comes on these is made in France, by a company that doesn't offer support or even have a phone number.  I learned this the hard way, after my device froze and then somehow erased my password which resulted in being locked out--with no ability to recover the files or password.  Don't buy these things--they aren't built well.  If you do, never count on it--always make sure your files are backed up somewhere else.  Also, I wouldn't recommend using it for business related purposes.  Mine crashed on a way to do a company presentation for a potential client.  Sandisk has very poor customer support--you will talk to India and they will offer no help.  They even tried to get me to buy a password recovery program to solve the problem--which solved nothing.  The   software is very flawed.  Beware!</review>

<review id="8084">I have a strong willed Rott/Shepard mix that likes to bark.  I purchased this in hopes it would solve the problem...it didn't!  The dog actually went as far as pulling it down and playing with it!  Cute item...great idea...just didn't work for my dog.</review>

<review id="8085">I've put this up on a very fast mac. I NEED it to work (I've been using Office for lectures for many years). It's full of bugs (like it won't save in the .ppt format), and really slow on big files (and I'm running a dual processor  quad core machine with 10Gbytes of main memory). I'm about to uninstall it and re-install Office 2004 which at least works properly.</review>

<review id="8086">This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)      Many of the scenes have very bad background picture quality (snowy is the best way to describe it).

<review id="8087">I used this MP3 player for less than 20 hours before it failed.  After that the power would come on, but it would not boot up beyond the brand name screen.

<review id="8090">I had a nightmare trying to get this to install properly.  After exhausting every online help possible, I finally had to e-mail technical support since Microsoft has no help available via telephone.  I am still waiting for problems to be resolved.  It appears that A LOT of people have issues trying to get the firewall installed.The anti-virus missed a spyware program and a trojan that McAfee had to to find and delete.  Do yourself and everyone else a favor by not buying and supporting inferior Microsoft products.  Stick to Norton, McAfee, or PC Tools that produce quality products.</review>

<review id="8091">My title says all.when I bought this router, I was very impressed with its features.I even set up hard disk with router and exposed it as a media server. Was able to successfully see movies seamlessly via my PS3 in living room.Every feature it offers, works great.  The only problem that compelled me to return this is frequent disconnects. Was with customer support (in Philipines) for more than 2 hours. Ultimately, I decided its not worth the time to get it fixed.I had to forget about 5Mz frequency. If I used dual frequency, disconnects were even worse.My VPN used to disconnect once in half hour. And could not copy large files.I bought Belkin N+, has similar features, but no media server. I can't see it through my PS3, but at least I can use it without interruption. I am happy with it.</review>

<review id="8092">Years ago I noticed that within minutes of applying it, my dog became lethargic and decidedly unwell.  I reported it to my vet and he poo poo'ed the idea that dogs react adversely to Frontline.  Well it happened a couple more times so I played safe and changed to another brand and surprise surprise, no side effects.  Then recently, I did not have the other brand but had Frontline in my drawer and my dog was scratching like mad - so I applied it.  Within minutes poor fella was acting strange - almost like a fit.  I rushed him to the vet and saw a different one on duty.  He confirmed that many people had reported their dogs reacting to Frontline.  At least that made me feel I wasn't imagining things.  So, all I'm saying is, just as with human medication and side effects, if you notice your dog behaving strangely a short while after applying Frontline,(becoming quiet, lying in his bed for an abnormally long time, shaking his head as if he was trying to get rid of something in his ear, etc.)you might want to consider something else.  No-one wants their dog to suffer.My neighbour swears by Frontline - says she wouldn't be without it and her dog acts no different when it is applied.</review>

<review id="8093">About a year old, and has failed.  Thankfully, this was used purely as a redundant drive, and no important digital pics nor my music collection was lost, as originals were on my main computer.  don't count on this piece of garbage unless you have redundancy.</review>

<review id="8094">...there is a baseboard where you want to mount it.  The instructions that come with the gate state explicitly that the gate cannot be mounted because of the unevenness of the wall with a baseboard.

<review id="8097">I have loved each Pixar film so far, and I bought this film without renting it or seeing it in theaters. That was a big mistake. This movie is pretty to look at, but boring as hell. I can't see how any one, particularly children could sit through this film. This film is not even the same ballpark as Finding Nemo or Toy Story or any of the other Pixar films for that matter. There is barely any speaking and the movie is not even funny. Where is the entertainment value?  I still get laughs out of all of the other Pixar films but not this one. Like I said, it sure was pretty to look at, but overall the worst pixar movie yet.</review>

<review id="8098">Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)      Personally, I've never been a fan of Symantec's Norton line of security products. In the past, they've been resource-hungry and troublesome, sometimes even causing systems to become unbootable. Norton 360 version 2.0 is something of an improvement, at least when it comes to system resources. It largely gets the job done I suppose, but makes some glaring oversights. It doesn't support Firefox or Opera browsers, there are no wireless security tools and the user interface is probably one of the most poorly conceived and implemented pieces of software design that I've seen since the early Windows 95 days. Note to Symantec: A new window shouldn't have to pop-up every single time I click on an option.Throw in probably the slowest backup options I've ever endured, and there's just no way that I can recommend Norton 360 (version 2.0). It might protect your system from some of the nastiness out there, but it will also make it much, much more of a hassle to do things that should be taken care of in the background. For the most part, you can do a better job of securing your system using open source software that's readily available.</review>

<review id="8099">I purchased this just before the new year. It has been working until now, the second week of March. Although, even when it was working I could not get it to create playlists but at least it would play the music I put on the thing. Now all of a sudden the display screen comes up when I turn the unit on and I am not able to access any of the menus. Its frozen. I tried to exchange it through Amazon but the return center would not allow me to. I called SanDisk and they tried troubleshooting the problem. It turns out the thing is broken. They created a shipping label for me and I am returning it to SanDisk for a replacement. It sounds like this could have been avoided if I had downloaded their firmware updater on the SanDisk website. Whatever bug the unit has could have been fixed but now its too late. At least I will be getting a new one but I am not happy with Amazon for ignoring my request.</review>

<review id="8100">I was greatly disappointed that this coffee maker is made of cheap plastics. At least the brewing parts that contact hot water and latches inside should have been made with strong metals. Instead, it's all cheap looking plastics. Just take a look. I don't know when it is going to break. I don't think that it will last more than a year. It is definitely not the quality of coffemaker that costs $150.I was also very disappointed that the coffee that this machine makes is way too weak. If you are a Starbucks coffee drinker, you will never like this. If you drink a weak coffee from a drip coffee machine, maybe you will like it. I just don't understand that this coffee machine is rated so high in here. Something is very wrong...</review>

<review id="8102">I have owned this product for over a year and it is truly, bar none, the biggest piece of garbage ever.  Customer service is non-existent.  When I was using DSL for my internet connection, I had to reset my connection at least 3 times a day.  Now that I changed to cable internet, I still have to reset the connection at least twice a week.  I would give this product negative 10 stars if I could.  Truly an awful product.</review>

<review id="8103">I received this for Christmas.  Here are my observations.It is very heavy.  I would never mount this to my helmet and ride with it. It doesn't come with an SD card (?!)  Luckily I had one for some other electronics that I have.  I loaded it in and recorded some video and audio from my living room.  I then extracted the SD card and loaded it into my Mac.  The video shows up as a .avi file.  Good!  I tried playing it back and found the video poor and grainy.  There was basically no audio at all.  I heard some clicking, and my voice was very, very quiet.  Basically no audio at all.  Okay, time to read the manual. The menu system is very VERY poor.  I can't believe this got through their quality control!  The audio control is either ON or OFF.  No volume control at all, although it is hinted at in the manual.  Hmmm...  It will be easier and give much MUCH better performance to carry my Fuji camera around and use that when I want to record something.  It even weighs less than this helmet cam!There is an addendum stuck in here.  It says the "ATC-2K supports the FAT16 format of the SD card ONLY".  What?!??  This shows a severe lack of trying on the software developer!  I'm not going to format my SD card to FAT16 to support this piece of junk.Yuck.  Finally, it came in one of those wrappers that must be torn to shreds to open.  I wonder if I can return it?  My wife ordered it from Oregon Scientific.  I can't believe they produced something this bad.</review>

<review id="8104">I agree with all the reviews with a rating of 1.  There is no way anyone should rate this product above a 1.  Last year, you could buy this product for $30.  They also charged an additional $17.50 to efile federal and $17.50 to efile state.  This year, the product costs $60 and they give you free efiling for federal.  You still have to pay extra to efile state.  For this,the efile fee for state has increased from $17.50 to $19.95.  So in reality, they are doubling the cost of the software.  I'm not sure what I am going to do this year, but for sure, I'm NOT purchasing Turbo Tax.  This is after purchasing the product for over 12 years.</review>

<review id="8105">The major change in Turbo Tax this year is their HUGE increase in price.  It is a hidden price increase.  If you want to do your kids simple tax returns, you have to now pay for each one which is unlike ALL previous years!!  When I contacted customer service to ask about the change, their answer was just a line trying to get you to believe they were saving you money.  I have used Turbo Tax close to the beginning of the software development, but 2007 was my last.  What a poor decision by what used to be a great company.</review>

<review id="8111">This product worked great at first, but after two to three weeks  my poor cat was covered in fleas again. After another application a month later, the fleas were gone at first but came back full force in two to three weeks again. I am not satisfied with this product as it did not perform as stated on the product description "...monthly treatment kills adult fleas, flea eggs, and flea larvae (preventing development of all flea stages) for up to six weeks and kills ticks for at least one month." I am hoping we can figure out how to get rid of these fleas. Incidentally, we have tried several other products (shampoo, flea collar, etc.) but nothing has been able to kill all of these pesky fleas.  Bottom line, killed the fleas but didn't last. A lot of money was spent for results we have acheived with cheaper products.</review>

<review id="8112">I returned the ASUS EEE and purchased an Acer Aspire One. The ASUS feels as if it was made for a child and appears cheap. The performance was sluggish on the internet.I'm much happier with the Acer Aspire One - it has more bang for the buck.</review>

<review id="8113">The bad news is that I just purchased this item, and while the toaster worked great, the egg cooker did not work at all.

<review id="8114">I purchased one of these in April 2007 to replace my SanDisk 4GB U3 Cruzer that would not work with Vista. While the Transcend 8GB JetFlash V10 does work with Vista, it writes exceedingly slowly. I benchmarked the two Flash drives and came up with the following (Cruzer followed by V10):Small File (1mb) Write: 2.391 - 6.532 secondsSmall File (1mb) Read: 0.672 - 0.938 secondsLarge File (10mb) Write: 17.656 - 22.594 secondsLarge File (10mb) Read: 6.813 - 6.281 secondsFile (20mb) delete: 0.110 - 1.953 secondsDirectory Lookup (10,000 files): 13.047 - 11.938 secondsOverall Write Speed: 5,462 - 811 KB/secondOverall Read Speed: 31,723 - 30,883 KB/secondOverall, the read speeds are comparable, but the write speed on the V10 is significantly slower. Slow enough in fact, that the V10 is not fast enough to support Vista's ReadyBoost although at least it works as a Flash Drive in Vista while the older U3 Cruzer doesn't work at all with Vista (newer U3 Cruzers are Vista compatible - be sure the firmware is recent).</review>

<review id="8117">I have an old Yorkie (11) and two puppies:  Yorktese and Maltepoo ages one and 9 months.  Per their heritages, they BARK at almost every noise and nothing we have tried has worked.  We do have invisible fence that worked like a charm, but he didn't want to shock them for barking, so we purchased three of these collars.  First of all, they are very cumbersome for such small pups (all under seven pounds).  It is very hard to adjust them to fit their small necks and to stay against their voiceboxes.  The collar worked the first time my Yorktese had it on and kept her from barking for about a week (we took it off of her, big mistake.)  After a week, she started barking again so it went back on.  My old crusty Yorkie just barks away with the spray going off time and time again.  My baby (Maltepoo) doesn't like the spray. but hasn't seemed to figure out yet that HE is causing it with his bark.All in all, I would say the collars are a failure and we will have to go to the shock collars after I get these paid for!!!!!!!  I wouldn't waste my money again on them as it isn't worth it.  Hopefully, the collar might work on other, bigger dogs, and to be fair, it did work on my Yorktese and hopefully after she wears it again for awhile, it will work again.</review>

<review id="8118">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Full-Screen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      The amount of violence in this film is disturbing for anyone, let alone the PG-13 designation. I expected comic book violence in the film, but I was appalled at the mass destruction and menace that smacks of terrorism, and haven't we had enough of that? Is this what the creator of Batman intended? Moreover, while the plot of choosing good over evil is admirable, Ifeel that the sub-plot of masking good as evil for the sake of theorder, is manipulative and dishonest. Sure it's a good ploy for settingup future Batman films, but it's merely setting the stage for more ofthe same old stuff. How much violence and bad-boy heroes do we really needto be entertained?</review>

<review id="8119">They are making these much more lightweight and, apparently, flimsy than they used to. The popcorn did taste great until the popper broke after about six batches. The plastic gears on the turning mechanism still turn around but the stirrer on the bottom of the pan doesn't, resulting in half popped and burned popcorn. I've used the stainless steel model made by another brand and the popper was durable but the popcorn really doesn't taste as good as that produced using aluminum. I am going to order yet another brand made of aluminum but with brass gears. Hope springs eternal.</review>

<review id="8120">About 3 weeks after purchasing this brick, it started rebooting itself. As time went on, it learned to enjoy the boot sequence and revisited it often -- every time it was turned on. I've been unable to locate my warranty registration card, so I can't even find out where to send it to get it fixed. The associated website is useless. There are quite a few places on the Web where discussions indicate that this rebooting problem is not unique to my machine.If someone knows how to get this piece of granite fixed, please share!</review>

<review id="8121">I love pampers cruisers and swaddlers. Cloth like, very little leakage, no leaking blue gels, and no stuck together gatherings. Unfortunately, I found out that my second child all the sudden became allergic to Pampers; I think it's the new ones with dry weave liners. He started to have red bumps on his bottom everywhere not characteristic of diaper rash (back, crotch, scrotum) and will not go away with diaper rash cream, topical antibiotics nor antifungals. I'm a pediatrician so I was really puzzled. I finally switched him to Huggies and used steroid cream and they went away. I even called Pampers and they told me that the diapers are still the same. ?@$#$ I found out that this is not uncommon with Pampers.  So moms beware. If your baby comes down with just red bumps everywhere and will not get better with diaper rash crea or antifungals (nystatin, clotrimazole), it might be an allergic reaction.</review>

<review id="8122">This is not for the product, which I can't install, but for the lousy support--I'll never by another nuance/scansoft product again!  I can't install the program because I want to put it on a computer that does not have an internet hook up.  Hey, you guys at Nuance/Scansoft, Not Every Computer Has an Internet Hook-up!  Once you own the product and go to the support site to activate it (on a different computer), THEN you see that you need the hook-up, but the product does not mention this little fact anywhere else.  You only learn after you buy it.I could talk to someone about this (for a charge!)  I could e-mail customer support and get an answer (for a charge!)  How about this: I already paid you guys for the product!  Why should I then be charged again because I want to use it?Companies like this do not believe they need to provide assistance to their customers.  I only hope that people will stop buying their products and rewarding them for screwing us all over.</review>

<review id="8125">This product and company are an absolute joke. The unit , the main attribute of which is its portability , is sold without a charger and as it turns out it should only be charged by connecting the unit to a computer. What is the point of selling a unit that is small and portable but that can only be charged using a (much larger) computer. In addition the camcorder is sent without any instructions about how to charge it. After an increasingly absurd email exchange it became evident that the Flip camcorders can be damaged by using a USB power charger. Indeed I appear to have damaged the battery by charging it this way. The company simply says that they do not sell a charger and that they are not in a position to recommend a suitable chargers. They also say that one should consult their web site about how to charge the unit without providing this recommendation or any other relevant information in the package that it is shipped in.One gets what one pays for and I would have been much better served by paying more money to buy a camcorder from a professional, reputable company.</review>

<review id="8126">Bought the 8GB 7 months ago, and really love the convenience, ease of downloading, functionality.  Until now.  Just like so many others have stated, it works until it dies.  Only 7 months of use for over $100, and now I only get sound from 1 earphone.  The jacks in these things have a defect (not enough solder??), which degrades over time causing the headphones to stop working in stereo.  Have to send back, and labor is not included in warranty, nor is shipping product insured back to them.  What a headache.</review>

<review id="8127">This review is on the movie "Howard the Duck". I went into this with an open mind not knowing what to expect other than George Lucas had made it. This movie tanked at the theater and that explains why you typically won't find it on any rental or retail store shelves. Lucas caught a lot of flack on this movie and even he admitted it didn't fare well. Although a copy being made again will make the handful of die hard fans happy, it is doubtful it will sale many copies. This is not to say some movies didn't do well at the theater and then sold very well on DVD. I am happy they are selling it for such a good price to the fans. However, if you haven't seen it before, I highly recommend you rent it first. The humor didn't not get many laughs from most during the original release. In fact I mostly heard groans at the theater I saw it at. Great priced quality DVD with several extras and plenty of replayability for Howard fans. By the way I respect the die hard fans of this movie because I know what it is like to love a movie that everyone else thinks is a turkey so please don't give me negative votes because I don't like it. You wouldn't want others to give you negative votes just because you like it would you? If you enjoyed this catch "Who Framed Roger Rabbit". CA Luster</review>

<review id="8128">I am gentle with my things, and this broke after 2 times use. I tried installing new batteries. Amazon states 5-year warranty but the manufacturer's site had no such information. I must have gotten a lemon, considering the great reviews here. I couldn't return it since I threw away the box. I tried opening it up and saw that there was a small motor. After fiddling with it, if I press down on the motor in a certain way, the frother works. The motor doesn't have enough power to start up. Now I have to stick a bit of tissue inside for better contact and twirl the frother to get it started.</review>

<review id="8129">I was hoping this would help but it didn't.  A lot of noises can set off the spray mechanism and eventually my dog became unphased by the citronella.  We used it for a couple of weeks and it stopped spraying.  Yes we changed the battery...Yes we refilled it with spray...The nozzle makes a hiss like it's clogged and nothing happens.  Premier really doesn't have much support through the website so I don't know what to do...</review>

<review id="8130">Arrrrgh!!! I hate this stupid thing!  Several hours worth of work is gone forever because I saved it on my new SanDisk 8GB Micro drive.  I used it for a month or so with no problem.  Last week, I had my first corrupted file.  Now I have dozens of corrupted files!  Thankfully, I have a backup of most (but not all) of them.  If I didn't have a backup, I'd just be out of luck.  I will NEVER buy another SanDisk product.   (And yes, I was always very careful to use either the Eject button in the Cruzer program or the Eject button in Windows beside the clock.)</review>

<review id="8131">I have been debating my rating all day. At first read, I liked that the book was not what I expected. But I was very disenchanted about so many things. And really creeped out too. I mean you couldn't STOP reading it, but not because it was great, because you had to see if there would be any explanation or redemption in the end.But there wasn't.There were a few good descriptive parts that bring my rating to a 2 star. Looking at the series, you can come to a different conclusion. But this book alone just didn't fit. Not that they were all super great either. So many of the ideas and characters all along have seemed, I don't know, borrowed from other similar novels. But before they at least had a magic to them that made them stand on their own. No magic here. Except the magic that made a baby vampirling...</review>

<review id="8134">I've had the Drinkwell Fountain for my cat, Jilly, about a month now & she still refuses to drink from it.  Since she liked to drink from a running stream from a bathroom faucet, I thought she would love it.  She ran her paw under the stream a couple of times & that gave me hope.  It hummed from the beginning but seemed to start humming louder within a day or two.  She became afraid of it after that. It is still plugged in, except for cleaning, just in case she wants to drimk from it.  But I believe she will out wait me!</review>

<review id="8135">We got it up and running with some hassles (we were forewarned by the reviews) but have been surprised at how often it drops the connection and we have to reboot it.

<review id="8136">Whoa!  Like so many others, I was a little disappointed with this last installment.  When I first learned that about 1/3 of the book was from Jacob's perspective, I almost didn't want to start it.  Jacob was a real jerk in book 3.  I couldn't wait to read about the wedding (I am female, after all), and I wanted to see what possible conflict could come.  My biggest complaint of all is that there was so much WAITING for the Volturi.  The pain, the stress, the agony of waiting dragged on and on.  And then, poof!  All gone!  I have heard some complain that the denouement was too short.  I don't think so unless you consider the balance between the waiting and the ending.As to Stephenie diluting her messages...  Call me old-fashioned if you will, but I still believe that a woman's greatest role is that of wife and mother.  I am NOT saying she shouldn't be educated (I am) or that she should NOT wait until she is mature to wed (I was) and have children.  But at the end of a woman's life (I know, she is immortal, but we're not!), she will not ponder her great business conquests or her wonderful social climbing.  She will think of her children and her family.I did find it refreshing that they waited until the wedding night, which is so rare in modern fiction.  I found some of the descriptions surrounding intimate scenes a little racy for teens.  I don't want my daughters reading it at 17!This did tie up just a little too neatly.  I didn't mind the imprinting so much--I think she did a good job at preparing us for that with Quil and Claire's relationship.  It is a little creepy, but I was happy for Jacob that he imprinted somewhere.  I am glad there were happy endings for everyone except Irina's family, but I think there may be been a different way to get it.I'm glad I borrowed these books and didn't buy them.  I don't know if I'll ever read them again.</review>

<review id="8137">I bought one of these last November on the strength of good results from a Netgear purchase several years previous. It was a mistake. After 9 months in service, the router suddenly stopped connecting to the modem. I spent nearly two hours on the phone with Netgear's tech support, while they had me swap cables around and try various things that didn't fix it, at the end of which we had verified that the internet port was no longer capable of connecting to my modem. The tech didn't offer to issue a return authorization, but promised me that a higher-level tech would call me back as soon as one was available.Five days later, I got an email (NOT a phone call) telling me to do exactly the same things that hadn't worked before, and assuring me that this would fix it. The email explicitly said that I should email back if there was any additional problem, but a reply to the From: address promptly bounced, and no other email address was given in the message. Trying to get Netgear's attention by submitting a Follow-up on their website has been equally unproductive.I've been without a router for over a week, and Netgear still hasn't made any effort to offer a replacement or a fix. I've had it with Netgear at this point; I'm going to buy a different brand as a replacement, and sell whatever exchange they send me (if I finally get one) as a used unit with no warranty.</review>

<review id="8138">My Acer Aspire One Linus died after one week, leaving only a blank, black screen upon startup, with no abiity to move my cursor.  From searching the net I found that this is not an isolated instance.

<review id="8139">as a long time Krups user thought I'd upgrade to the Cuisinart - unfortunately while the product looks great the coffee just does not deliver. Tried every possible configuration: more coffee, less water, the 1-4 cup setting but the coffee was consistently watery and flavorless. Also agree with the other reviewers that the lack of an external water gauge is annoying. Returned the product and went back to the Krups FME 4 and while the Krups has cheapened the carafe and product the coffee still delivers and thats the ultimate goal</review>

<review id="8140">I received the blender on 06/04/08 and began using it shortly thereafter to make daily smoothies.  However, on 06/27/08 I noticed that the blades had stopped turning.  When I took the blender apart, I noticed that the silver thing that fits into the center of the base (the drive?)--was no longer attached and could not turn the blades. I was very disappointed because I expected great things with such a powerful motor.  Amazon gave me the option of replacement or refund.  I'm going to try the blender again.  If this one does the same thing, I will request a refund.</review>

<review id="8141">I've used MS Word since the mid-90s, and this is like a slap in the face from Microsoft.  I can't imagine they tested this with anyone not involved in its development.  Everything one needs and has learned to access in earlier versions has been spread to hell and back.  It does auto-formatting contortions a python would be proud of.  I had to set up a task bar with all the old icons...heck, I can't even describe the struggles I'm having.  I got this suite on the cheap (educator's discount), and am going back to using Open Office, which I had installed on my new machine to tide me over till I got MS Office.  Microsoft, for God's sake, stop changing stuff simply for the sake of change, and before you foist another such abomination on the public, take a few users of old versions and have them give it a run...and I mean average users--the kind who don't need or want every damn cutesy thing you can come up with.</review>

<review id="8144">This is, without question, the worst coffee maker I've ever owned. Despite its good looks, it clogs up and once it does no matter how many times you clean it, it never works the same again. In my case the problem was that I failed to place the carafe under the spigot correctly - an all too easy mistake to make - and ever since then, despite literally hours of trying to clean it, it overflows.Because the inner basket that holds the filter has ribs in it, cleaning it is next to impossible. Also, once you've developed a clog, even if it looks like you've gotten out all the grounds, the water flows too fast and you wind up with a mess on your kitchen counter.The shutoff valve doesn't work properly when you remove the carafe during brewing to pour a quick cup. Altogether I consider this the worst designed coffeemaker in human history. Buy at your own risk. Cuisinart should be ashamed of themselves. I plan to junk it as soon as I can afford a new coffee maker and can't imagine I'd ever purchase another Cuisinart product in the future.</review>

<review id="8149">I purchased 3 of these keyboards as Christmas presents and had to send 2 of the 3 back for replacements since the keys stop functioning after the first few uses. The first replacement was a breeze and I was greatly surprised at how easy Amazon is to work with when having an issue with an item. When the second keyboard went bad, I was irritated but knew it would be easy to replace. Unfortunately that wasn't the case the second time since Amazon is no longer replacing the item but instead refunding my money since they have had more issues than expected with this item. I now have to send back all 3 keyboards and lost $60 on the World of Warcraft keysets I purchased for them. My only advise to someone looking to purchase one is go with the Merc or Fang instead.

<review id="8150">I have the Farouk TURBO CHI 2" iron and wanted to also get a smaller iron. I ordered this less expensive 1-inch iron because I wasn't sure how much I'd use it PLUS how different can it be from the other Farouk "TURBO" CHI iron I have? VERY DIFFERENT. It was cheaply made, and you couldn't adjust the heat setting - there is only one setting (ON) and this made the outer paddle (end) part get too HOT to touch or hold while pulling it down the hair. I returned this iron. The Farouk "TURBO" CHI 1" is great (as is the 2-inch). It has the adjustable heat settings and the red felt on the ends so it doesn't get too hot. The smaller iron is great for putting curls and flips on the hair for a different look.*The CHI TURBO irons have heat seatings and red felt on the end so the iron doesn't get too hot to hold/touch. Far better all around. Look for the red on the iron in the pictures. Pay the extra money and get a good one.</review>

<review id="8152">Junk is the only way to describe this thing. Failed (with the click, click, click of death) literally 1 week, exactly 7 days, after the warranty expired. I didn't realize it actually had been a year until I dug out the receipt. And the customer service is a joke. Tried calling 3 times; one time I just set the phone down on speaker phone and after well over an hour of waiting, listening to their recorded message, I finally hung up. And 4 e-mails to customer service were totally ignored, although even though the first 3 were polite & respectful, the 4th was anything but, I have to admit. Even though their bare drives regularly get very good reviews, I will never buy another thing with the Western Digital name on it. They clearly have no interest in keeping customers.</review>

<review id="8159">The concept the product the quality is all good. But this review is about customer support. That's because buying is one time activity, using is everyday and if something does not work, you need good customer support. So my previous I am posting some of my previous comments as a main review.So this leads me to think that Ooma is not 'very honest' in telling what they are upto. What are their long term plans. Will they be around next few years...etc."Yes, I agree to many rating 1 reviewers. Ooma is using Amzon as a platform to further it's interests. Rea my ocmment on their customer service. If this Bobby guy can spend so much time on Amazon reviewer's reply, why can't he just answer the freakin calls that never get answered. Beware this is some sort of scam going on here. Looks like 100s of reviews posted here are just ooma people adding positive reviews to lure gullible people into this mega electronic free usa calling scam...you will loose your landline, phone number, all the important contacts that have your phone number. Use it as an experimental second phone number or give it to you kids...you are risking your reputation if something goes wrong here."I agree 100% with Richard. The Ooma customer support stinks and sucks !!! As you read this try calling them and I bet you would be spending atleast 30 minutes without anyone answering the phone. I did not even get a voice mail option and had to drop the calls in frustration after waiting for eternity. I initially tried making a quick call when catching a 5 minute break amidst work, but soon realised that with such abysmal levels of support, I could never get talking to one of them. So I started calling them during my longer lunch breaks or when driving, hoping that I would get through...but no avail...luckily for me the set-up worked. But I had few questions to them that I could till now never got to discuss with them. Just be aware of this....</review>

<review id="8160">This movie is not even close to a good vampire film.The acting was terrible, the visual effects were not at all impressive andI could not make a connection with any of the characters.If your looking for a REAL Vampire film in this era that will send a chill down your spine, you might want to try "Let the Right one in".

<review id="8162">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      Just for the record, I never really was a fan of The Transformer cartoons or  comic books, or anything like that. So, as far as this review goes, you won't be reading about any comparisons between this film and any of the other Transformers shows, comic books and films of the past. Basically, I watched this film just to watch it, and really wasn't expecting a lot. And that's exactly what I got. This film is nothing more than feel good nostalgia for those who used to enjoy the cartoons as a kid, as well as an attempt to attract a new generation of young fans. No, I guess I can't say I can blame Hollywood for doing something like this, after all, thats there job to earn a profit. But doesn't Hollywood ever think about the quality and integrity of the product they're putting out there? After watching this, apparently not. Cause I really don't know what they were doing here. The only thing that I can figure out is that they are trying to distract the audience and have them focus so much on the special effects, that they hope the audience will simply ignore the stupid storyline and horrible dialog that fills up the small gaps in-between the  action. I mean really, this is some of the stupidest plot points that I've ever seen in what is supposed to be a "good" film. I'm not even gonna go into detail with the overall plot, but as the film goes on, the story gets dumber and dumber. And to make things worse, some plot points are started, and totally abandoned. Again, I won't go into great details, but there is a huge part that involves finding a "valuable" pair of glasses, but then, the movie turns, and all of a sudden, the glasses become unimportant, and they are never mentioned again! But not only is the storyline dumb, but the attempt at humor put into this, is just horrible! Undoubtedly the dumbest thing in the whole film is the horribly painful to watch scene that involves the main character Sam trying to hide his new Robots friends from his parents! Not to mention, the crappy corny dialog between the Autobots themselves..gimme a break! Just the fact that the robots not only talk, but have facial features that includes blinking their eyes?! What tha? Do robot need to blink? Geez.. Now I know that the robots talked in the cartoons, and again, I know that this film may have been directed to a younger audience, but I just wish they would make up their mind here! They put corny crap like that in the film, but then they attempt to create a serious storyline, put in the military, secret government projects, semi-real tactical battle sequences, and even a scene that references masturbation! I mean, make up your mind guys! Is this a kids film or just a pure action film? Really, it doesn't matter which. Because this film is bad in either case! I really feel though, that this film, if done correctly, could've been pretty good. It just wasn't done serious enough. Actually write a GOOD story and they might have had something here. The main reason I'm even giving this thing 2 stars is simply because of the special effects. Despite what I think of the film, the effects were great, as well as most of the action sequences were good. Now, I think they were a bit overdone, and dominating the movie too much, but in retrospect, I would definitely rather see the Autobots and the Decepticons go at, than to listen to more crappy dialog! But the effects only proves to one thing, and that when Michael Bay does films like these (Bad Boys, The Island, etc.), its clear that he's very unbalanced. Yes, he can pull off the cool looking effects, but when it comes to an actual story and plot, he's not very good at it. And this film is no different. So if you're simply looking for huge special effects with exciting action sequences, this one is for you. However, if you're looking for absolutely anything more than that, then you're out of luck. This film should be only watched by young kids or people with low movie IQs.</review>

<review id="8163">I was disappointed with this product.  The cuff was ultimately too small and kept popping open which only got me frustrated which ultimately would increase my blood pressure.  I couldn't get an accurate reading because the cuff size was too small.  This probably would have been a good product for me if the cuff had fit.  Omron does make the best machines so if you do have a small arm, it would probably work very well.  I did return the product for a different Omron machine with a larger cuff which did work for me and which I am satisfied.</review>

<review id="8164">This is utter nonsense. I have a Tivoli iyiyi that I love and that worked wonderfully with my last ipod. This one displays a message saying that charging is not supported, then it freezes after a few moments. It does exactly the same thing on my Honda ipod port in my Accord. This is just outrageous considering I now have several hundred dollars worth of apparently useless ipod gear, not to mention a useless ipod. I strongly recommend that you consider this problem if you have older ipod compatible gear and that you consider not getting into ipods at all if they are going to keep changing it's compatibility.</review>

<review id="8165">I purchased this Waterpik in June '07 and a couple of months later the handle malfunctioned inside so it would leak all the water and therefore it had no cleaning pressure. I contacted the manufacturer and after a couple of weeks they sent me a replacement handle. That worked well up until now (a year later). The handle broke again on the inside where it fits the attachment and can no longer hold it - a small spring came off along with a small plastic part that broke. Anyway, this model is a good concept but must be made of cheap materials so don't expect yours to last too long, look for better options.</review>

<review id="8166">This does seem to be a wonderful  podometer which does deliver everything they say it does.  The problem is that it is SO SENSITIVE that if you're riding a car and the road isn't PERFECTLY  smoothe, it will register the vibrations as steps!!  If it had an on/off switch or a PAUSE BUTTON to turn it off and stop counting steps whenever you're on any motorized vehicle it would be THE perfect podometer. A few days ago I realized at some point in the day that the pedometer was marking waaay to many steps for how inactive I had been that day. I then thought of checking the steps before and after I got into the car and realized that any minor vibration is registered. One would have to write down the number of steps before and after any ride on any motorized vehicle and do the math at the end of every day! I find this extremely frustrating</review>

<review id="8167">SPOILERS!!!Well, it's certainly a nice film, upbeat with a happy ending and a simple resolution to an insoluble set of problems. Basically, it's a three-segment TV show, the first segment (Wall-E and Eve) being the best; the second and third introducing the space ship Axiom, its captain, passengers, and robots, and then resolving a conflict between the Captain and his evil robot auto-pilot about returning to Earth for the happy ending. The three segments are loosely linked together by the quasi-romance between Wall-E and Eve set up in the first segment, but there is a real conflict within the film itself between two faces of the story: Wall-E and Eve on a nearly destroyed Earth, and the cartoony battle between the Captain and the minions of the evil auto-pilot.It's easy to be critical about the second and third segments. They're cartoony to the max, they lack character development of any kind for the Captain and the Auto-Pilot, they resolve into the happy ending without any explanations. For example, how come the Captain can transform from an ignorant fat slob to the hero who leads his ship back to Earth? Unlike the subtle and nuanced portrayal of Wall-E and Eve, neither the Captain or the Auto-Pilot have any reasons for what they do. Auto-Pilot is merely evil -- but why should an autopilot program behave like that? -- and is destroyed far too easily for a machine that can operate the entire ship. These flaws are not repaired by frequent references to recent U.S. politics -- the president of the BNL Corporation sounds exactly like George W. Bush; the "Green" theme is hand-wavingly clich閐; the use of commercial themes like the power-up chord of the Mac computer is too local to have any meaning for an isolated world on a spaceship 700 years in the future. In segments two and three, the film makes a wrenching downshift to U.S. television animation, for example, in its much too easy parody of obese Americans lounging in beach chairs.Also notable is the shift in animation technique and meaning between the first segment and the second two. The first is done in ultra-realist animation, in sepia, tans, and browns, with skillful and sometimes strikingly surreal images of huge monuments of compressed trash. Wall-E collects odd remnants of human history, and I was hoping -- vainly, as it turned out -- for a resolution/explanation of his preservation of toys, dolls, a beautifully-rendered Zippo lighter (it still has lighter fluid after 700 years -- a wonderful touch!), and almost poignant clips from old musicals and operettas. But instead of taking Wall-E and Eve on a journey to find what these things mean and to discover why Wall-E collects and treasures them, the film wrenches into the cartoony fat slob Captain -- and we lose all the previous and careful cinematic presentation of a world that seems doomed to die. So there can be no real epiphany of rebirth at the end, because the film-makers abandoned that world for the cartoony fat slob captain.In parallel, the first segment has some impossibilities -- though I'm tempted to call them "mistakes," both factual and cinematic. One is that the world portrayed is not 700 years in the future. The future world of "Wall-E" is shown as having at least one seedling and having rain (for example, there's a thunderstorm) -- and in biological reality the world and its garbage-compactor cities of cubes of trash therefore would be an overwhelming mass of greenery (that seedling came from a seed; seeds come from mature trees; there would accordingly be plants everywhere). So we mentally change both the time frame and botanical reality to accept the plausibility the vision we are shown of a world depopulated of humans and inhabited only by cockroaches and robots. Into that world comes Eve -- and we want to know how they will resolve the story. Obviously, fat slob captains are not the answer.So "Wall-E" is one-third of a fine -- very good indeed -- setting for a cinematographic story that is not resolved and never reaches the epiphany it deserves. And so we, the viewers, are left at the end smiling and chuckling at the wittiness (?) of animating fat cartoony captains, and are deprived of what could have been a genuinely first-class animated film.</review>

<review id="8168">First off, this bread machine makes excellent bread.  My wife and I bought the SD-YD 250 in March of 2007 and have used is steadily for the past year.  We grind our wheat using a hand-crank stone grinder, which tends to make a slightly denser loaf than all-purpose or bread flour.  Week after week, this machine has produced excellent bread and dough.  Unfortunately, it is now March of 2008 and the machine fails to mix the dough properly.  We just tried making pizza dough and to our utter disappointment, the dough was unmixed and stuck to all sides of the pan and the motor was making an awful squeaking noise.  I called panasonic and we are past our 1-year warranty, so I'm currently researching other bread machines to replace this one.  For the excess of $100 dollars I paid, I really expected this product to last longer.  I WOULD NOT  recommend purchasing this bread machine if you plan on using it for more than 1 year.</review>

<review id="8169">On the positive side, this version is starting to really take advantage of the Mac platform, but my overall assessment is that Intuit is, at best 2 minor updates, or at worse 1 major release, away from getting this software right.  At the moment there are too many bugs to recommend this product.  And worse, tech support is PAID ONLY. This is unacceptable for a "beta product" that has this many bugs.   Hopefully, the problems with address book sync, the template layout manager, and overall reliability will improve over time.  Check back here a year from now.

This is not a movie review forum, this review forum is meant for the PRODUCT (blu-ray vs other version).Amazon, please assist in filtering this, such that when I look for reviews of a PRODUCT in future, I might actually be able to find the ones which actually do, rather than have to sift through hundreds of over-zealous fans' personal step by step synopsis of the storyline.</review>

<review id="8171">It worked OK for about 6 months, although at one point it completely lost all the settings and I had to start from scratch to re-load them.Then it stopped working - I could talk to it through the lan port but it couldn't talk to the cable modem, never got an IP address. Tried everything under the sun, finally bought a Linksys 54 and everything works fine.Tech support was horrible - took two weeks for them to tell me I had to call in. Waited 30 minutes (twice, call was dropped first time), then they said the router was fine, I should pay for Permium service and if in the end it turned out to be hardware they'd refund the payment.So really, the warranty is only 90 days.I'd avoid this (and I guess all other Netgear products with this crazy 90-day-and-then-you-pay warranty scheme.)</review>

<review id="8172">This review is from: The Five Thousand Year Leap: Twenty-Eight Great Ideas That Are Changing the World (Paperback)      The author is very quick to jump to unwarranted conclusions.  Rather than relying on well-reasoned arguments, he cites authorities, frequently distorting his sources.  He fails to prove his view of Biblical law and its  relationship to the American Constitution.  He fails to provide any  evidence for many of his most important points.   He does not reveal that  the source for many of his ideas is in Mormon theology.  END</review>

<review id="8173">I managed to get through the entire season 1 and the first disc of season 2 before completely giving up on this series. I seriously do not understand why so many people think this show is so great. The acting is really bad and the storylines are mostly silly. Additionally, every character is so flawed that there isn't a single one that you feel any sympathy for. So you end up either feeling hopeless because humanity doesn't deserve to survive in these peoples' hands, or worse you end up rooting for the Cylons.Don't believe the hype. And don't waste your time on a garbage show like this. There are a ton of other better shows out there on DVD that are worth your time. Just off the top of my head - Veronica Mars, Firefly, How I Met Your Mother, Robot Chicken, Lost, Heroes, 24 (barely). Heck, even the first two seasons of the O.C. was better. I'm giving up on Battlestar and moving on to the Wire season 1. Then after that I'm going to check out Jericho. I have also heard good things about House.</review>

<review id="8174">This coffee maker has two distinct settings; off and hounds of the baskervilles.  The high pitch wirl of the boeing 747 turbofan coffee grinder will more likely have you dreaming of throwing baggage on some tarmac strip than sipping a hot cup of joe with Juan Valdez.   Cleaning the machine can take upwards of ten minutes and has the complexity necessary of supervision from Carl Sagan and the Army Corp of Engineers.  Failure to strictly adhear to the coffee degaussing will result in the maker spitting up coffee like a three month old on a double milk bottle binging fit.  Bottom line, cool look designed by the devil to break your will to live at 5:30 in the morning.</review>

<review id="8175">This is our 4th Panasonic bread maker - the first 3 were fine. This one made a solid little non kneeded not palatable loaf and when we called the company (where they strive to give you "excellent customer service" they say) and told them the dasher did not seat properly in this brand new machine we were told it was a new design and that is how it is suppose to work. Several months later, many many bad loaves of bread, new yeast, new flour etc still doesn't work - and ya know what Panasonic does - you have to send it to the service center and they will decide if it doesn't work. They say they will send a call tag (they don't) they say they will email a call tag (they don't) the right leg doesn't know where the left leg is and you get to go thru the delightful phone tree repeatedly where the people are trained to say they are sorry BUT THEY DO NOT DO THE RIGHT THING - so we are breadless and will NEVER buy anything Panasonic again. They treat their customers like dirt..</review>

<review id="8179">I bought this product thinking it was very humane.  My dog got sprayed once, after barking, and was so tramatized by the citronella spray that she ran into her crate and cowered, trembling with her tail tucked tight.  I immediately took the collar off, but it took until the following morning, (the initial spray was at about 9pm), until she was herself again.  I then thought that perhaps it was just the citronella scent, and so was going to try the unscented spray, but on the can it says 'don't get on eyes or skin' and all I could think of was 'hello, what do they think a dog's nose is?'.  I'm now looking into ultrasonic bark control.</review>

<review id="8180">i would have rated BD better if it wasnt a part of the twilight series. that being said, i thought this final enstallment was written from a completely different author. many, many times i was like "wait..is this really S.Meyer writing this?" all of the tension between bella/edward/jacob and the volturi that was built up in the series was almost nonexistant in BD. it felt like the author ran out of storyline and plot and filled the entire book with fluff until the very end, only to let down the reader..again. it was a decent story, but a complete let down for being the conclusion of the twilight series.</review>

<review id="8181">I had read so many good reviews about this camera but the longer I own it (around 6 weeks now), the more problems I find.Pros: small, lightweight, very easy to stick in your pocket or bag, just took on a cross-country trip, also quite cute-looking (I got the orange and white), fairly intuitive to use, slim users' manual, easy to play back on TVCons:1. The red record button sometimes works when I push it and sometimes not.  (My fingers are medium sized, by the way.)  This has led to a number of videos that don't end when they're supposd to, and usually have my voice in the background saying "Why won't it turn off?"  I also have missed some wonderful scenes because it didn't turn on to "record" until I had pressed it 10-20 times.2. When playing back recorded video on the camera or TV, I have run into the problem a number of times where it says something like "Disc unreadable" in the middle of a video and just stops playing it.   No amount of trouble-shooting could fix this.  Then maybe a week or two later, the video was suddenly "readable" and would play.  This unreliability has meant that close relatives missed seeing important videos during visits. 3. My biggest problem is being unable to burn DVDs from my videos. One of the main reasons I bought this camcorder is because it is supposed to be Mac compatible. I had problems downloading 29 minutes of video to my computer.   First, the computer froze when I was transferring all the videos at once.  Later, I tried to do it one by one and still encountered the problem in terms of it would get stuck on one video and never finish transferring it.  I had to manually shut down the computer each time and restart it.  Then after hours of work when I had downloaded the videos to the Flip Library on my computer, I found it impossible to get any Mac applications to read the files in order to burn DVDs.   i-DVD said the files were unreadable.  With a Mac, you need to use i-DVD to burn DVDs that will be playable in DVD players.  I really don't know what to do about this biggest problem, since the reason I bought the camera was to be able to make home movie DVDs of my young daughter. I would definitely NOT recommend buying this camera and for anyone looking for a low-price camcorder, if you look for sales you can get well-known brands like Panasonic for around $200.  I would imagine these work better than the Flip Ultra. Looking at the reviews so far, I see quite a number in the one-star category.  Perhaps quality control for the Flip Ultra is not as good as it should be yet.  I am disappointed this camera did not live up to my expectations.</review>

<review id="8182">As everyone else is noting, drive starts off working great but dies within a month or two with a disconcerting loud ticking noise of the head crashing.Given the number of these drives failing, its unbelievable that Seagate continues to market them!On the upside, it has caused Seagate to get its act together on processing returns and is even trying to make money on it.  For $20 they'll process your return even faster.  For $300 they'll try to recover the data you lost when their subpar, poorly made drive crashed on you.Anyone finding a hard drive they can recommend?  Seems like both Seagate (and their other company, Maxtor) and Western Digital are just shipping poorly made products that fail within a few months.

<review id="8183">Norton has unilatterally determined that "they know best" and when you try to optimize your disk, it WILL NOT optimize them unless NORTON thinks they need to be optimized.  Even 7% fragmentation does not reach the "magic threshold".I chated for over 1 hour with Norton Support (an oxymoron) and was told that I should just use Windows Defrag because 360 would only defrag when IT wanted to.Systemworks is a GREAT product - could run SpeedDisk and even at 7% fragmentation you could speedup your computer by running the utility. I guess Norton thinks that every single computer user now-a-days is "computer illeteriate", and that they need to FULLY AUTOMATE EVERYTHING.Bottom line - if you have Systemworks, stick with it and use one of the free antivirus products.BTW - don't even think of trying to combine SystemWorks with Norton Internet Security - in Norton's great wisdom they won't let you install them if the other one is installed.</review>

<review id="8184">My Krups ProAroma died last week and I have had it since 1994. That's when I started drinking coffee. Came on to this sight and after much stress of what coffee maker to get, the reviews convinced me to get this one. I'm taking mine back and getting a refund and here is why.1. The coffee didn't taste good. I grind my beans and occasionaly use pre-ground. I have made seven pots, a couple of 5 cups and the rest 12 cups. The coffee has just never tasted as good as it did with my old unit. I threw out the first two pots. I've never had to throw away coffee from my old unit. And yes, I ran water thru the unit like the directions said to clean it out before the first use.2. One time on a 12 cup the grounds overflowed the filter and made a mess. I've never had that happen with the Krups. The only thing I could figure is the Krups filter is a little larger or the Cuisinart can't have the beans ground as fine.3. At counter height, you can't look down into the back and see how much water you have added, so you better make sure you get it right on the carafe. Without a flashlight to shine down to see which little stair step water level you are at, you are out-of-luck. Only at the 11 or 12 cup mark will you know.4. Because the carafe is tall, and the place to add the water is in the back right corner (and it isn't very big) it is hard to get all the water out of the carafe. You have to really tilt it up to get it emptied. A man might not have trouble but a 5'5" woman has a hard time getting it poured in. If the coffee maker was setting on a table instead of a counter it would help that problem.5. And as others have said, if you tilt the lid all the way up, condensation on the lid will run down the back of the unit.6. If you get a cup before it is done, it will drip a little.7. The clock is hard to see, wish it had been backlit.I do love the way it looks, I like the little toggle switch, I like the 1-4 cup option, the heating option and it does make the coffee hot. But I'm not keeping this one, I will keep looking.</review>

<review id="8185">I have debated whether or not to write a review about this book since there are already so many well written ones for and against it, but I finally gave in and decided to throw in my two cents worth.  So, here goes:I have mixed feelings about this final chapter of the Twilight saga because although it is written in a fashion that allows you to still get lost in the story and continue to turn the pages, there were just too many poor creative choices that marred my opinion of the characters.  Without giving away too many details or adding spoilers, SM had her main characters making choices that were inconsistent with their personalities.  In doing so, she weakened Edward and turned Jacob into an even more spoiled and petulant child than he already was.  I already had trouble believing in Bella and Edward's love for one another because it seemed the only thing that defined their existence.  Bella states that Edward has a brilliant mind aside from his beautiful face and body, but I am never really shown that.  All he does is pine and worry for Bella to an irrational degree while stalking her whenever she thinks he isn't around.  That really gave me the creeps.Bella suffered some horrible stuff in this book and it is described in full graphic detail, yet we couldn't have one romantic scene of her finally giving herself to Edward?  We have been teased and teased for three books and when the time comes for them to finally consummate their union, we get black out after black out.  The sad thing is SM is perfectly capable of writing a very tastefully described romantic scene.  Why didn't she?   (Judy Blume got a lot more graphic over 30 years ago in her book "Forever" and its intended audience was teenagers.)  Either SM was poorly advised against it, or she chickened out.  Why did she think we could stomach the horrific more than some much needed romance?  It's the simple romance between these two characters that made Twilight the success it was.  Why did she make it so much more complicated then it could have been? The climax becomes an anticlimax.  No one gets hurt and everyone gets what they want.  If I had it my way, I would have had a huge vampire battle where Rosalie and Jasper get killed--maybe even Esme.  Not because I disliked these characters, but because a great book comes with sacrifices and doesn't shy away from the tragic.  Instead clumsy little Bella becomes a superhero vampire who now takes on the role of protector instead of the protected.  I would have preferred to have Bella remain human just until the end of the book so that the readers could continue to identify with her.  Then her transformation would have been brought about in a more intimate scene with Edward and not what we were given.  The vampire genre is all about the bite.  That's why it's so popular.  To summarize my opinion of BD, I borrow from SM:  "Ugh!!"</review>

<review id="8188">This product broke within 3 days of use.  The screen was blurred and malfunctioning, and no longer dispensed any food.  I tried changing the batteries (which were brand new) but that had no affect.  It just simply BROKE.  It's possible that I bought a lemon, but I opted for a REFUND instead of a REPLACEMENT because of the following:The sole reason in buying this product was the " pre-programmed food portion" feature.  Unfortunately the pre-programmed "portions" dispensed were VERY inaccurate.  When I programmed it to dispense 1/2 cup, it dispensed a FULL cup.  For the 3 feeds that it DID dispense before it BROKE, it was supposed to dispense 1/4 cup, the lowest possible quantity, and it dispensed 1/2 cup.  I know this because I measured the amt dispensed fearing my cats would gain weight.  I wasn't impressed with the overal structure of the product either.  I thought the big plastic tub that stores the food was a bit flimsy and made of very thin, cheap plastic, about the equivalent of what they use to make 2L plastic soda containers.  While it did screw in nicely to the holder making it impossible for the cats to knock over, when I tried to open the lid off to put more food in, I thought I was going to break the bowl in order to get the lid off.  The lid did not come off easily and I really had to give it yank to get it off.  I think the bowl would have eventually snapped or cracked and been rendered useless within months anyway had it not completely broken within days.</review>

<review id="8189">I purchsed this product in January 2008 as a replacement to a much older version of a Sonicare product. It worked well for about 10 months. Then the vibration got weaker and weaker. The battery is charged and it sounds like it's working fine. Now, after 11 months, it does not vibrate at all, even though I can hear the battery working. I'll have to send it back to the manufacturer. This product is far too expensive to have to go through this. I do not recommend purchasing such a high-end toothbrush that has given others similar problems.UPDATE: I called Philips customer service center, was on the phone for under 5 minutes, and they shipped a whole new unit to me. It arrived within a week. They prepaid a package to return the old unit to them. So while I still am disappointed that the initial product broke, I am very pleased with the ease of replacing it. Philips' customer service department was friendly, efficient, and apologetic.</review>

<review id="8190">The Christian community today desperately needs a literary talent to convey the Christian faith in a compelling way such as C. S. Lewis or John Bunyan did for previous generations. Unfortunately Wm. Paul Young is not that man. I am not qualified to judge its literary quality but by training and vocation I am qualified to speak of its theological content. Unfortunately from that standpoint the book is simply dreadful - and on so many levels that it is difficult to know where to begin. What Young attempts is rather audacious. He presumes to put words in the mouth of God - not mere snippets that relate commonly accepted proverbial truths but whole chapters of dialogue in which God tries enlighten a modern day Job (whose name is Mack) who has experienced an awful tragedy (his young daughter has been abducted and murdered by a sexual predator) regarding the mysterious ways of God. In short, Young attempts to answer Job-like questions - something God Himself refused to do for Job in the Bible - by putting his own speculations into the book's dialogue as Mack has weekend long encounter with God in the very shack where his daughter was murdered. The result is rather predictable and disappointing. The god of The Shack looks far more like a wish-fulfillment of a postmodern western intellectual than the God revealed in the pages of the Bible. Politically correct sensitivities are duly observed as the trinity revealed in the Shack appears to Mack as `Papa,' a "large beaming African American woman," (p. 82) `Jesus' a Jewish carpenter and `Sarayu' a spirit-like Asian female. Other left wing sensitivities emerge. `Papa' is clearly anti-gun holding Mack's at arm's length between two fingers while disposing of it (pp. 84, 88) and religiously active patriotic Christians are portrayed as sincere but sadly misguided (p. 181). Careful readers will note too that `Jesus' informs Mack that "Marriage is not an institution. It is a relationship.... I don't create institutions; that's an occupation for those who want to play God." (p. 179) Of course, if marriage is not an institution, then we are not bound by the rules of the one who instituted it and if relationship is its essence then logically it would seem that any type of relationship would qualify. Whether he intended it or not, Young's depiction lends itself to our culture's attempt to redefine marriage. Whatever else may be said of the god of The Shack, she is up to date - which also means that she will soon be out of date. More importantly, Sarayu, in true postmodern fashion, is careful to inform Mack that relationships are never about exercising the will to power over others (p. 106). Indeed, `Papa' is reticent to impose her will on anyone, repeatedly insisting to Mack that he is free to do whatever he likes (pp. 89,182) and that she will proceed on his "terms and time." (p. 83) In fact, The Shack god takes offense when Mack asks what she expects of him (p. 201). The idea that God might have expectations is even treated as an insult. If this is the same God who spoke through the Old Testament prophets (who had just a few expectations of his people and let them know it) or of the Apostles (who commanded all men everywhere to repent in Acts 17:30) then he has undergone a radical transformation over the centuries. The Shack `Jesus' goes so far as to inform Mack that it would be contrary to love if he were to force his will on him (p. 145) - again, a stark contrast to the Jesus of the Gospels who had no such qualms saying, "If you love me you will obey what I command." (John 14:15) In fact, biblical love is defined bluntly in terms of obedience. "This is love for God: to obey his commands" (I John 5:3; cf I John 2:3-5). But Sarayu insists that Mack has no rules to follow, is under no law and has no responsibility or expectations (p. 203). In fact, she assures Mack that "I've never placed an expectation on you or anyone else... And beyond that, because I have no expectations, you never disappoint me." (p. 206) Such an all-affirming god may soothe the self-esteem of postmoderns but she bears little resemblance to the God who spoke through Jeremiah or John the Baptist.It is true that the New Testament does tell us that we are no longer under the Law of Moses, but it also insists that we are "not free from God's law but (are) under Christ's law." (I Cor. 9:21) And while it is certainly true that we cannot earn God's favor by keeping rules, it is simply false to say that God has no rules or expectations of His people. A much more accurate representation is to say that when we are transformed by God's grace, we become a people who desire to do his will, his commands are no longer `burdensome" (I John 5:3) because His law is "written on our hearts." (Jer. 31:33) This kind of careless theology is dangerous in a culture that is all too eager to cast off any and all restraints and justify its autonomy. It should not surprise us then to find that `hierarchy' and `authority' are bad words to the god of The Shack. "Once you have a hierarchy you need rules to protect and administer it, and then you need law and enforcement of the rules, and you end up with some kind of chain of command or a system of order that destroys relationship rather than promotes it. You rarely see or experience relationship apart from power. Hierarchy imposes laws and rules and you end up missing the wonder of relationship that we intended for you." So the `Jesus' of The Shack informs us (pp. 122-3). But they are words that are hard to reconcile with the real Jesus of the Bible who was not embarrassed to speak in hierarchical terms of his relationship with the Father: "the world must learn that I love the Father and that I do exactly what my Father commands." (John 14:31) Unlike the biblical Trinity (I Cor. 11:3), there is no hierarchy among the members of The Shack's trinity who find such a concept incomprehensible (pp. 121-122, 124). In a perfect world, we are told, "there would be no need for hierarchy." (p. 124) Again, this flies in the face of the biblical depiction of the perfect world God created in the garden of Eden where He commanded Adam and Eve not to take of the fruit of the tree of life. In fact, the fall in Scripture is portrayed as a violation of the hierarchical order that God had established. And paradise in Scripture is only restored when "every knee will bow and ever tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord." (Phil. 2:10-11) It all sounds rather `hierarchical' to me. This is no small error but one that goes to the very heart of true biblical faith. Salvation occurs when the heart of an individual is brought back into loving submission to its proper Master. C.S. Lewis captured the beauty of that concept well when he said that "Equality is a quantitative term and therefore love often knows nothing of it. Authority exercised with humility and obedience accepted with delight are the very lines along which our spirits live." (Weight of Glory, p. 170) But The Shack is so enamored with postmodern fads that it cannot perceive even the most basic spiritual realities. Significantly, the biblical metaphors for God are all authority figures to whom submission is appropriate and necessary: Father, Shepherd, King, Judge, etc. It is certainly not coincidental that the god of the Shack is portrayed in far more effeminate terms.Since authority is jettisoned as unworthy of God, the concept of sin likewise is all but absent. How can we violate the will of a God who has no expectations and is never disappointed? The book speaks much of `brokenness' and of `horrendous and destructive choices' (p. 190) but little about human rebellion and wickedness - even though the story revolves around a horrific crime. The Bible tells us plainly that God "hates" and "abhors" wicked men and judges them accordingly (Ps 5:5-6; 11:5-6; Prov. 3:32-33). Sinners may come to experience the grace of God, but not because they are lovable but in spite of the fact that they are not, because of the sheer greatness of God's love, not our inherent value or worth (II Kings 17:15). Only one human has ever been truly worthy of God's love and that is Jesus. God's grace is dispensed freely to unworthy sinners only by virtue of the fact that they are in the Beloved One (Eph 1:6). But the god of the Shack repeatedly informs Mack that she is `especially fond of' everyone (pp. 118-119) and that as humans, we are "deserving of respect for what you inherently are..." (p. 190) "Guilt'll never help you find freedom in me" she tells Mack (p. 187) nor does she "do humiliation, or guilt, or condemnation." (p. 223) She certainly doesn't "need to punish people for sin" (p. 120 - the only reference to sin that I can remember in the book). In contrast, the God of the Bible, though "slow to anger...will not leave the guilty unpunished." (Nahum 1:3) He is a god who "will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction...." (II Thess. 1:8-9)Since sin is marginalized, the atoning work of Christ is downplayed as well. We are informed significantly by `Papa' that when Christ cried out on the cross `My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' he was actually never forsaken at all. He only "felt" abandoned. (p. 96) This subtly drains the cross of its meaning. It implies that Jesus was not actually taking the punishment for our sin which truly does alienate us from God and required that the Father turn His back on the Savior as He bore that sin on the cross. Instead, the meaning of the cross is reduced to Christ's own subjective spiritual growth - "He found his way through it to put himself completely in my hands. Oh what a moment that was!" says `Papa' (p. 96). When Mack asks specifically what the significance of Christ's death is, `Papa's' explanation says nothing of sin, or of God's wrath (Rom 1:18; Eph 2:3), or of the shedding of blood as an atonement in our place (pp. 191-193). The discussion predictably emphasizes reconciliation since that has to do with relationship and relationship is where its at among postmoderns. But there is no indication that our alienation is due to our real guilt - our violation of God's Law - i.e. - His expectations of us. The impression we get is that reconciliation is needed not because the holiness of God has been offended but because Mack is "really scared of emotions." (p. 192) In other words the barrier to relationship is not his guilt, but his own psychological frailty and fear that keeps himself from opening himself up to God's love.Since sin and judgment are underplayed, conversion is not very important to the `Jesus' of The Shack either. Those who love Christ, we are told, come from every religious system that exists including Buddhists, Mormons and Muslims and `Jesus' has "no desire to make them Christian" though he does "want to join them in their transformation into sons and daughters of my Papa, into brothers and sisters, into my beloved." (p. 182) We are not told how to reconcile these seemingly contradictory statements. At one point, Sophia, a personification of wisdom whom Mack encounters, seems to imply that even the murderer of Mack's daughter is a child of God and exempt from judgment (pp. 161-2). Admittedly, the dialogue is somewhat cryptic but it implies that God is above condemning sinners. This is certainly a far cry from the clarity of Scripture which warns not to be deceived into thinking that the wicked will inherit the kingdom of God (I Cor 6:9). Sophia's words at best open us up to just that sort of deception. In short, the god of The Shack is a god that is very comfortable and very human (even having accidents in the kitchen!) - Mack feels right at home in their company from the start. In contrast, every human-divine encounter recorded in the Bible leaves the human recipient trembling in awesome fear. This alone should alert the reader that something is seriously amiss in Young's presentation.I have just scratched the surface regarding the errors that I encountered in this book but this review is too long already. I have tried to limit myself to the most egregious offenses. Time and space forbid me from addressing numerous problems with regard to his portrayal of the Trinity and the incarnation. Whatever merits the book may have are clearly overshadowed by these serious deficiencies. Young's aim in trying to lead the reader into an encounter with the living God is admirable. And his portrayal is no doubt appealing to people of our generation. Many hearts will be stirred by his sympathetic identification with those suffering from pain and doubts arising from tragedy. But unfortunately the god that Mack meets in The Shack is not the God of the Bible. They are two very different gods and in the end we are forced to choose whether we will submit to the authority of the one true God on His terms as expressed in the very first of the ten commandments: "Thou shalt have no other gods before me" (Ex 20:3) or cast our lot with appealing figment of Young's imagination.</review>

All I wanted to use this SanDisk for was working out at the gym, and listening to some music before sleep. This product works fine at high volume in the gym setting, but the equalizer is crap. I use a nice pair of skullcandy headphones, and the music sounds like it is coming out of an extremely old set of speakers.At low volume, there is this very irritating buzz that interferes with the music, probably because the MP3 decoder that the device uses is crap.Bottom line - The product sucks if you are used to listening to high quality MP3's above 128kbits. All of my music is at 256K or higher, and it just sounds like crap. I only use this device in the gym where I play it very loud, which drowns out the annoying buzz that you typically hear at low volume. You get what you pay for with this device.</review>

<review id="8193">This review is from: Wall-E (Two-Disc and BD Live) [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)      I'm rating the Blu-ray 2-disc edition only, not the film. I preordered the Blu-Ray versioin of Wall-E months before its release--at the time there was no description. As the release date neared, Disney started running ads touting the Blu-Ray with the digital download. I thought it would be great to have a choice of watching it on my HDTV or iPhone. When my package arrived (a day early), I quickly opened it and looked for instructions on getting the download. When I couldn't find any info, I checked Amazon and discovered that now there are two versions of the Blu-ray. This two disc package and a three disc one. Only the three disc version comes with the digital download. Worse, both are priced the same. Amazon, you ripped me off.Since I opened the disc already, I'm sure I can't return it. Maybe I can save you the same mistake. Be careful which you buy.</review>

<review id="8194">This review is from: The Princess Bride (20th Anniversary Edition) (DVD)      While the movie rates 5 stars, this edition of the DVD is a poor offering for a 20th anniversary edition.  The text for the menus is incredibly tiny and hard to read, and the special features are seriously lacking compared with the 2006 Dread Pirate/Princess Buttercup editions.  The Art of Fencing featurette is covered in the 2006 edition, really, and the Fairy Tales and Folklore one has an equivalent in the 2006 DVD as well.  Only the Untold Tales Featurette is new, and it's only--like all 3 of these--about 8 minutes long.  It's a must-have film for every DVD library, but do yourself a favor and get the 2006 Dread Pirate or Princess Buttercup release with the additional features, because the 3 featurettes on this DVD just aren't worth it.</review>

<review id="8195">I bought this DVD after seeing  it talked about on a talk show.  I should have saved my money as it was one of the worst pieces of claptrap I have ever seen.  This is the secret; if you see it, it will come.  If we are negative, negative things will come our way, including such things as auto accidents or thefts.  If we are positive, we will get everything our heart desires.  Money will rain down from the sky and we will find perfect love.The only people who are seeing money rain from the sky are the producers of this dvd.  Save yours and don't buy this.</review>

<review id="8196">When my son was first born, we tried both Pampers Swaddlers and Huggies size 0 (whatever they're called), and we settled on Swaddlers.  Then, we won a year's supply of Huggies, so obviously, we used those throughout my son's first year.  Now that supply is gone, and I decided to try Pampers Cruisers for a change. Oh my g-d, I'm seeing things that I NEVER saw with Huggies - there's silica crumbs all over the diaper area almost at every diaper change.  I have to take him into the sink and wash it out with water at every diaper change.  I didn't change the frequency of my diaper changes, it's the same  time interval that I used with HuggiesTrue, they don't leak, but Huggies never leaked either, so when this pack is finished, I'll go back to Huggies.I've never had silica leak out of a Huggie diaper, in my opinion that's just dangerous and shouldn't be around a baby's privates</review>

<review id="8199">This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series (DVD)      I had been watching this program on Discovery Channel in HD and this program was AMAZING! However, I just received the DVD today and this version for standard DVD is HORRIBLE compared to what I was watching on HD. Perhaps I'm biased, but the quality seems even worse than regular television. I'm going to send this back and buy the HD version and see if that's any better. Bottom line: don't buy this DVD.

<review id="8205">I read so much positive stuff reguarding the popularity of the FLIP I bought one, a MINO-HD. It's darn simple to operate and the picture quality is  very acceptable.Battery life also seems very good. My one and only problem has to do with  available recording time.The 60 Minutes you have has more or less disappeared once you use it and getting the time back  has been  tricky to impossible.It's enough of a problem that FLIP's  own website has posted solutions to "solve" this issue. The solutions they post did not cure the problem and Flips email only tech help has been lousy and hit and miss.Their claim is to respond to inquiries with 48 hours, but I've found that claim to be bogus. Their offer of support is pure flustration when you go back and forth with emails and only get response's  50% of the time.Flip needs to step up to the plate and get some real tech support out and fast.

If I pull the carafe out, then coffee starts coming out onto the warmer plate full stream.

<review id="8209">I'm a huge Twilight fan but this book was disappointing.  The characters did not connect as they did in the previous books.  The story line seemed a bit choppy.

Hopefully Midnight Sun will be much better.</review>

<review id="8210">Any woman who reads this book should ask the following question after reading it:"Of what value would a relationship like this be to me?"There is more to life than sex and having a clean house.  Men know that and have many other things in their lives besides women.I really began to think like a man when I realized this and cultivated my own interests which include writing, music, philosophy, art and many other things.  I can say that in my single life I was smart, independent -- and not particularly lonely, either.Now I am married -- I'm glad I got married and wouldn't change my choice.  But one of the reasons I married the man that I did was because he did NOT have the same views as Mr. Harvey.</review>

<review id="8211">We were using Office 2003, and the company decided to upgrade to both Vista and Office 2007 simultaneously.  The overall result has been slower performance of both machine and user.  The change to the ribbon menu system has made everything unnecessarily complicated and ponderous.  The user is actually left to relearn everything, and there is no option to return to the classic view.  You can tell instantly if software is good because it is intuitive.  Unfortunately, Office 2007 is counterintuitive.  The simplest things before are now harder to do.  The features you most need are harder to find.Moreover, the system is unstable.  I have saved documents in the new .docx extension of Office 2007, only to find later that they cannot be opened.  The .docx is also Microsoft's way of forcing those using Office 2003 to upgrade to the inferior Office 2007.I suggest that everyone start switching to Open Office and begin breaking away from Microsoft, a company that does not bother to consult with the consumers before bringing out a flawed and unwieldy product.</review>

<review id="8212">It implies that you can make it fit your large hand if you have one, butit still doesn't: your choices are between tiny and pretty small.  If youwould like to try palm mousing you'll be dissapointed unless your hand istiny.With weight there is sort of the opposite problem: its heavy without anyweight added.  So you can choose between pretty heavy and really heavy, neither of which you will probably like much if you come from cheap mouse land.  Weight isn't really good for anything, it just makes starting and stopping take more work.The thumb buttons are soggy and ill-positioned as usual with other mice.Haven't bother with the software so I can't say how well that works.</review>

<review id="8220">I am a supporter of good positive mental attitude book, tapes, films, etc., but "The Secret" is not one of them.  Those who are fortunate to live in countries with thousands of opportunities around them will be helped by concentrating on what they want, rather than what they don't want, and this is not a secret.If we believe what "The Secret" tells us, then children in African nations who are kidnapped and turned into child soldiers or sex slaves only have their own negative thoughts to blame.  Farmers in Bangladesh whose food and homes are destroyed in floods are creating this themselves.  I believe that this sort of thinking is sick and twisted.  It allows grotesquely rich individuals to say, 'I am rich thanks to my thinking - you have exactly the same opportunity as me, therefor I should feel no obligation to help those who are less well off'.I also seems to say that because "the universe will provide", we can all have exactly what we want.  This seems shockingly short-sighted given the growing consensus that if we don't slow our consumption of the earth's resourses, there won't be a habitable earth in a few generations time.  So anyone who really wants it badly enough can have a $4M mansion.  Why is it that these people all seem to want more and bigger and better STUFF?That's why I say this is about greed.What annoys me is that some really positive elements have been cobbled together in over-marketed hype, along with dangerous BS (if you're poor it's your own fault).On a final point, where is the evidence that Plato, Shakespeare, etc. knew the Secret.  Ultimately, this is just one Australian TV exec who stumbled on an old positive mental attitude book and dreamed up a clever way to market old information.</review>

<review id="8222">I'm 27 and I've been using Braun electric shavers almost daily since I started shaving my face, probably about 12 years ago. I tried Philips/Norelco wet shaving system once (Cool Skin) but I had to return it because my (apparently very sensitive) face was destroyed after just one use. My face can't stand razors either. I wanted to replace my four years old Braun Synchro, not because it was bad, but because I was fooled by advertising, and this shaver looked promising. Yes, the device looks nice, weighs less than my old Synchro, the movable foils seem a good thing at first, and the cleaning system looks much better (it's still quite big, though). But I was hugely disappointed after the first use: my old (and much cheaper) Synchro shaves noticeably closer than this Pulsonic, even though its foil blade should have been replaced by now. The (few) hairs on my neck the Synchro is unable to cut, arent't cut by the Pulsonic either. And it gets worse: my skin was much more irritated, especially on my neck, where a lot of red bumps appeared soon after shaving (I used Gillette after shave, as usually). And it happened something that has never happened to me before using an electric razor: the middle foil made a cut in my lower lip (I can't do that with my Synchro even if I try to).Yesterday I gave it another shot but the results were no better than the first time.The redness and irritation might go away as soon as my face gets used to this shaver, but I doubt it will shave my face any closer in future uses.I couldn't care less about the looks of the shaver, its weight (as long as it's reasonable), its battery life (I always use the power cord) or the cleaning system (I use the one that came with my Synchro very few times a year). I just want the closest shave possible without leaving my face tomato-red. And my old Synchro definately does a better job at that than this Pulsonic, so I think I'll stick with it.I really wanted to like this shaver, but I can't recommend it. I understand that there are many different types of skin and beard out there, and some guys might get fantastic results with this shaver, as some others do with Philips/Norelco. But check that you can return it if you are going to buy this.</review>

<review id="8223">I've been using this brush for quite a while but had always bought the head in supermarket. But 3 month ago I couldn't find it in any supermarket then I bought this one. Shipped pretty fast, looked good. But then, having used it for about 2 month, the tip became very loose and I have to be very careful as I brush my teeth, for it could pinch my tongue or mouth!! I even bled for a few time. Yesterday I got to remember that before the blue color on the bristle would lose gradually, indicating when you need a new one. But after about 3 months, the color on this one was not lost at all (my husband is using it too, so neither was his). I seriously doubt whether it is real oral B. Be careful!</review>

<review id="8224">Once my daughter started to walk I knew I had to change to a diaper that had a better fit since she was moving more. I decided to try the cruisers. They had a perfect fit, didn't leak and were a reasonable price. I never had a problem with them until recently. I noticed they put a new mesh lining. I thought, okay they are trying to make the product better, why not. Then I started to notice how the mesh lining would stick to my daughters behind. She has been constently pulling the back of her diaper. I tried to stick with it and keep using the cruiser but this week I noticed another difference. There are new tiny beads inside the diaper lining. I noticed that the beads were bunching up in certain areas and when barely wet it looks like she is wearing a heavy soiled diaper. Barely wet or not the mesh has also been leaving an impression all over. The mesh does nothing but stays wet!!! If it did the absorbing it wouldn't leave an impression on her. This diaper used to be the best but the new changes are bad, I wish that pampers would go back to the way it was! Now I have to go through the hassle of finding a better diaper.</review>

<review id="8225">Yes it hurts and Yes it works. I though this would be the solution to all my unwanted hair  but I am really disapointed because the reason I bought this is because waxing breaks me out and this did the exact same thing! Every spot I used the epilator has red bumps on it that looks like acne and then it turns into acne! I used this on my face and on my lower back, so its either have unatractive hair or have unatractive acne..

<review id="8226">So i came on to amazon and saw raving reviews about this product. I have a dog that when spooked ( by lightning or near by military base blasts ) he gets very scared. If no one is home to let him in he jumps my fence and takes off.Im not sure if most people that bought this have either a large yard/lot that there house sits in or are on a ranch because it definitely seems to work funky in my house. I set it up in the middle of the house against the back wall so i could focus the radius of the fence range towards the backyard. I played with all the settings as per the manual and im unable to get it to work properly. If walk clear across the house out the garage and to the middle of the street the beeper goes off.. but if i go in the back yard i can hardly get to my back fence which is about have the distance to the street.  Deciding to settle on this weird ellipse i then proceeded to try it out with my dog. First attempt to get him at the edge of the range worked as designed and my dog retreated into the garage  where was safe... but then as we walked around in the garage and back in to the house TOWARD the base unit it occasionally beeped indicated the dog was at the perimeter again... and continued to scare my dog into thinking a shock was coming.   Also if you have a fence line that you want to get your dog to stay away from this product is not for you.. obviously i should of figured that i cant use a circular wireless wall to cover a square lot...I dunno if mine is faulty but im returning this thing tomorrow</review>

<review id="8227">I bought this in hopes to prevent my Jack Russell Terrier from being such a barking terror!  He's somewhat rowdy and enjoys barking quite a lot....  I had bought one of those electric collars that emits a piercing sound but this just drove him insane and he would freak out trying to get the sound (I know it sounds weird but if your dog does it, you should know what I mean) so that didn't work.  That's why I moved on to this anti-bark collar.I'll be honest... this collar works very well as long as he is wearing it but as soon as you take it off, he starts barking again.  The reason he stops barking is because of the spray, however the collar is somewhat bulky and weighty on their neck (and probably very uncomfortable) so he seems to have associated any type of collar with a box on the front as being the anti-bark collar and doesn't bark nearly as much (even when there is no spray or when it's turned off or even if it's not an anti-bark collar at all!!)  I'm sure not all dogs are like mine so this collar probably does prevent some dogs from never (or rarely) barking again, but it hasn't done too well with my dog (unless he's wearing it, like I said)I have grown used to the citronella scent and now think it smells good (and I don't have to spray air freshener as often!!) but they also have some scent-free spray, which seems to work just as well.With a money back guarantee, I'd recommend trying the collar for your dog, as it might actually help!!  And I still use the anti-bark collar but I just wish there was some way of making it smaller and therefore not as obvious to the dog once the collar is removed.  =)</review>

<review id="8231">After looking around a bit I decided to purchase an AspireOne to replace a larger, older laptop.  The product came out of the box and started up as expected.  I attempted to configure the AspireOne to work with my home wireless network.  After much fiddling around, I was not successful.  I've configured multiple PCs and Macs to work with the same network - the procedure is straightforward.Multiple user communities are reporting that the AspireOne uses a new WiFi chipset and driver, and that the driver will not work with networks that do not broadcast an SSID.  Practical implications - you will not be able to use your AspireOne for wireless access in many hotel, airport, airport lounge, and other access locations.I called Acer support, and that's where the real nightmare began.  Acer basically refused to support the product.  The first answer from Acer boiled down to, "You don't know what you are doing" and proceded to "Not our problem."  Instead of answering the question, Acer support finally just hung up.  Given that Acer was unable or unwilling to provide any information, I am left with only one conclusion - the user groups are correct, Acer has a problem with the AspireOne WiFi driver, and that Acer will not acknowledge or address the issue.There are a multiple small notebook/netbook products out there.  The Acer is a decent package.  However, unless you are very confident that you will NEVER have a question or problem with the product, you should consider buying a different brand.  Acer is a company to trust.</review>

Went out and came home 5 hours later it was down. called tech support ( only 3 min wait time) and went through the channels to find out the unit was gone, kaput,dead, fini,etc. So I am reversing my opinion. For what its worth stay away.....................................</review>

<review id="8237">I have have 500 gb model running on OSX 10.5 with no issues.  The 1 tb model is problematic with quality.  I have already returned 5 drives for various issues (Does not spin up  2x, Spins up but not recognized 2x, and DOA).  Did simon says with tech support, swap cables, connected to diff CPU, diff OS (Vista, XP, OSX), diff interfaces, swapped out with existing WD My book drive(500 gb model).  Uninstalled and Reinstalled drivers.  If you still want to try it make sure you can return it.  Because you probably will.</review>

<review id="8239">Purchased OneNote for my new Tablet Laptop for school. First time I tried it, the pen featured kept disabling itself stating "Windows XP tablet edition SP required". Um, ok I have that preinstalled on the laptop. Formated my machine and put a still steamy new copy of XP tablet edition back on. Nada. Upgrade to SP3, nada. Most people have had little problems with this app, but if you are like me and roll the dice wrong. You are boned, there is NOTHING out there to help you and Microsoft just says "We cannot clarify what or if there is a problem. Thank you."</review>

<review id="8240">This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series (DVD)      Twenty minutes into this DVD and I got to watch a caribou calf killed by a wolf, a shark snarf up a sea lion and an elephant calf get lost from the herd and perish.  Depressing and not what I want to see for entertainment.  This does not amaze, inform or amuse me in any way.  A high priced DVD that was totally dissappointing. I have no desire to view any of the the rest of it.</review>

<review id="8241">Amazon sucks, I did not get the product at all.  Initially they told it will be shipped on 31st July then it postponed to 14th August 07, I waited for almost until 22nd August 07 and nothing has happened.  I had to buy Pampers from local store twice within this period.  Finally I called up amazon and cancelled my order.  I would not advice to go for this option at all, you would never get your order, it sucks waiting for the shipment and have to call to know the status.  The online status still shows the estimated arrival date on 14th August 07.</review>

<review id="8242">Who designed the shape of Pamper diapers? I feel it is the worst shape for a diaper. Its tab is far blow waist position , which induces my son leaking poos from back and leaking pees from sides. To avoid leaking, I have to tightly package him, which induce red inprint on his legs. I bought Huggies diapers and Especially for Baby diapers for my son. He seems comfortable in them. Most important, no leaking happens any more! My son weight only 15 lbs.</review>

<review id="8243">I purchased my Le Bistro pet feeder about 1 month ago to make things easier on the person who was to watch my cats during my vacation.  The item arrived very quickly, was easy to assemble, and fairly easy to program.  It seemed to work like a charm.  After a week however, the electronic clock began to slow, and was two hours behind the actual time.  Then it began to dispense twice as much per feeding as I had it set for.  I replaced the already new batteries with another set of new batteries, and still had the same issue after 1 week. Reprogramming does not seem to match the instructions.   This item is fine for short term use, but not long term.... and please do not buy this if your pet has a medical condition requiring precise amounts/timing of food.</review>

<review id="8245">The GOOD:- A very complicated stick and throttle with oodles of hats and buttons, two rotaries, a slider, and a mouse controller including a wheel. The stick also has a twist function, but I didn't use it much because I already have pedals.- The stick is very long and has very light springs, which makes precise control possible even if you're a bit ham-handed.- The pinky trigger is adjustable in height for different hand sizes.- The whole setup plugs in to one USB port and is recognized by Windows as one device, which is useful for older, slightly more retarded games that can only use one input device.- It looks really cool in the dark with the all the little blue lights on.- It's CHEAP. Less than half the price of the Cougar or the CH Fighterstick and Pro Throttle. This is the main reason I bought the X52. I wanted to graduate from a joystick to a HOTAS system, and this was the cheapest thing I could find. If that's your motivation, though, you might want to read on...The BAD:- There are some ergonomic problems with the stick and throttle. I think I have pretty average sized hands, but I found myself sliding my hand up and down the throttle a lot, trying to reach all the controls. The hat switches on the head of the stick are hard to reach without loosening your grip and stretching your thumb up.- Saitek's programming software is called SST. SST is, for lack of a less degrading word, just f___ing nuts. The GUI is one of the least intuative I've ever used. It's hard to visualize complicated HOTAS functions with the setup, and even harder to figure out how to get it to do what you want it to. Worse, the program crashed frequently on my system, at least twice resulting in a corrupted profile, meaning that I had to start all over. You'd probably have to use the program to understand how annoying it is, but I wouldn't wish that on anyone.- The mode switch only switches modes. It can't be programmed to do anything else, making it harder to synchronize modes in SST to modes in the game.- Hope your flight sim has built-in support for rotaries, because the rotaries can't be programmed with increment and decrement functions. You can only split them in to "bands" and give them seperate commands for each band. Logically, this means they're only useful on commands which each have their own key assigned, are somehow related and yet also mutually exclusive. How often does that happen?- Four months after I bought it, all functions on the stick started cutting out randomly and intermittently. I checked cable connections, reinstalled the software, and switched USB ports. Alas, the problem kept getting worse. When the stick started losing calibration mid-flight, I had had enough. I e-mailed Saitek Customer Support about the problem, but I still haven't got a response almost a month later. Finally I got tired of waiting and went and bought a Cougar (this last problem might have been a blessing in disguise).All in all, the X52 is just a disappointment. I would say you get what you pay for, but that's not really true either. You get little toggle switches, pretty blue lights and a useless MFD, but they couldn't bother to make their programming software stable and user-friendly. Saitek's priorties are just in the wrong place. They spent time building a cute GUI with a nice 3d model of the stick and throttle, but they didn't realize you might want to program functions to the mode stick or use a button as a toggle between two commands. They need to realize that the HOTAS concept is about function over form.</review>

<review id="8246">I've got 4 children and have used a few different gates in my time.  We had one from our second child that we loved for our entrance into the kitchen but it finally broke and our fourth is still into everything so a gate was a must.  I saw this and thought, "Wow, it does everything I need!".  It's true, it's taller than most (my #4 is a climber and has come very close to climbing over standard gates), pressure mounted (we are putting this between a metal covered corner and thin paneling under a breakfast bar), and one handed operation while swinging both ways.  Sounded perfect for us.Then reality settled in.  It took less than 1hr for my 20mo old to figure out how to open it.  Yep, that's right.  20mo old, through it in under an hour.  The latch just isn't designed to stop a determined child.  It's 1/8" (maybe smaller) tongue that slides back with a thumb plate.  He yanked on it and popped it out.  Then he figured out how to pull it up and into the kitchen he went.  Hmmm...maybe we didn't have it tight enough?  We tightened it to the point where the auto-latch thing didn't work and we could barely latch it ourselves and still he got through.  No matter how tight or how loose we made it, he could open it.  We've had it a week and it's going back to the store to try something else.For the record, no, my #4 is NOT a huge tank.  He is tall (hence the reason I liked the extra-tall gate) but he is only 30% in weight.  If he could do it, so could just about any child that put their mind to it.  I shudder to think of these at the top of stairs.I did call customer service and was told no refund through them but I could trade for a different one.  All the ones that would work in that area had the same latch.  No thanks!</review>

<review id="8247">This camcorder is great as long as you understand what its intended purpose is.  I've also discovered what I consider to be a major flaw in its performance which may or may not affect you.This camcorder is targeted at the casual videographer who wants to be able to take along something to record videos much like someone takes pictures to capture moments as they happen.  It's small enough to throw in your pocket and take anywhere.The other side of this equation is that you're not going to get the greatest quality video from it.  That's the limitation of going with a fixed lens and the trade-off of going with such a small package.  Having said that, the camcorder can capture some pretty impressive quality video with ample lighting.  I found outdoor videos to be very clear with very little artifacts.  It is similar to what you see from intersection traffic monitoring cameras.  Low-light video is also surprisingly good, but you do start seeing the limitations of the capturing chip in artifacts as well as softer colors.Some people have complained about the codec, but that's really a non-issue as the Flip Video application will install the 3ivx codec for you upon initial launch.  Once that codec is installed, you shouldn't have any problems with viewing the videos either directly from the camcorder itself or after copying the file from the camcorder to your computer.  I was able to bring in the raw .AVI file into Adobe Premier Pro without any issues.The Flip Video application is okay for basic things like putting clips together in a basic "movie mix" as it calls it, but it re-encodes everything as a .WMV rather than an .AVI, which I thought was odd.So here's the flaw that I mentioned above.  It seems that the Flip Video has an issue with feeding large files to computers, whether they be PCs or Apples.  I can reliably copy short clips (under 100MB or about 3 minutes max).  However if I record a longer clip than that, the Flip Video will lock up and both Windows Explorer and Apple Finder will lock up as well, usually requiring a reboot.  I've verified that this happens repeatedly on two separate Wintel PCs and an Intel based iMac.  If you have no intention of recording anything longer, this may not be an issue for you, but since there's not set identifiable file size limit, you never really know when you'll bump up against the lockup issue.  The worst part of it is that it seems to corrupt the file as far as your computer is concerned despite the fact that the Flip Video itself can play it back.I gave it 2 stars, because it does have good bang for the buck when it does work, but unfortunately for my use, it does me no good since I can't get the larger video files off of the camcorder.UPDATE:  Since I wrote this review, FlipVideo has released a firmware upgrade that does, in fact, correct the problem of not being able to save large video files.  I have since been using it extensively to record videos of my one year old son, and I've had no problems with it.  The only complaint I have now is that the Flip software does not use the video file's filename.  Instead, it keeps a database file which indexes the video filename (VID#####.avi) with the edited filename if you change it in the Flip software.  If you change the video filename directly from Windows Explorer, the Flip software loses it and no longer sees it at all.  I would increase my rating to 4 stars at this point with the one star ding because of the software filename handling.</review>

<review id="8250">This is really a piece of junk. Over the last 5 years I have used at least 3  Linksys wireless routers. The first one was working OK then suddenly its wireless part stopped functioning so I had to buy a second one. Just like another Amazon user said in his review. This router only support wired connections. Whenever I connect my MacBook to it wirelessly, sometimes in seconds most often in a few minutes the router just freezes up, all my PC's connected to it will lose internet connection. The only way to get out of this is to do a manual restart. Yes I updated firmware, but it doesn't help.</review>

<review id="8251">A play-yard is a necessity especially if you travel and sheets are just as essential for it as they are for a crib, especially if you use it for a crib when you are away from home.  However, these sheets are not soft and comfy and I have found that they are a magnet for every little bit of hair and lint in the drier.  I bought the navy sheets to match the yard I purchased, but they look dirtier coming out of the wash than they do going in.  I would like a better quality sheet and I would like the option of flannel.  If you have the time and a bit of skill, take one of these sheets apart and use it as a pattern to make your own with better material.</review>

<review id="8252">I have owned Version 6 this router for several years, it works most of the time.  The thing that aggravates me is the fact that I have to reset it once or twice a week.  This usually occurs during heavy use ie. several computers doing intensive networking.  The router will stop handing out IP addresses, or just stop "routing" anything.  A reset always cures it.  It has an amazing ability to judge just how much downtime I am willing to accept without throwing it against the wall.There are many supposed after market firmwares for this router, but none of them work on Version 6.I have several clients that use this router as well, they have the same problems.  I do not recommend the router.</review>

<review id="8253">Okay, I read all 3 Twilight books super quickly and devoured them, but I have to admit (even though I really don't want to) that "Breaking Dawn" just flat out sucked. To me, making Bella pregnant simply ripped out the theme of unrequited, teenage love seen throughout the first 3 novels. All of a sudden, the baby made things majorly serious and instead of the playful, carefree, and immature Bella became an adult....I mean....wow. Making her have a baby just angers me SO MUCH! ugh! Also, why the hell did she split it up into 3 different books? Talk about inconsistency between novels 1-3 and 4. I felt like it wasnt even SM who wrote this 4th novel...it was that utterly shocking. And now I have to admit this---which some will probably roll their eyes at---but the romantic scenes between Bella and Edward were were simply, i don't know, plain. I'm so used to scenes that draw me in and make me blush.....but these scenes were annoyingly flat, uninteresting, and quite frankly boring. I mean, we've waited 3 books for Bella and Edward to consummate their relationship, and all we get are these dull descriptions that go nowhere. I don't know, does anyone agree with me here? I'm so fustrated, that I think I'll go back and re-read Eclipse and pretend like that was the last book in the saga. SM.....you need to rewrite this book. Seriously.The only reason I give it 2 stars is because Bella and Edward wind up together. AKA the only redeeming quality of this book.</review>

<review id="8255">I bought this for my long-haired Maine Coon who loves to be brushed/combed. It works just as described. (Even on a short haired tabby who doesn't like to be brushed.) My MC loved it.  I loved having less hair around the house. However, after a couple of months of regular use, I noticed that he was matting up on his hind legs. This had never been a problem before.  I'd work the mats out, only for them to return. A couple were so bad they had to be cut out. There was one so tight I couldn't cut or work it out. It had to have been painful for him. As soon as the weather warmed up, I had to have him shaved (At the cost of $120). That one mat was so bad, it left a longterm "bruise" in his fur/skin. It's been almost a year since and the matting has not returned.  I have not used the Furminator in that time either.The only thing different in our lives was the use of the Furminator. So my guess is that it caused this problem.</review>

<review id="8256">Was just my luck. Everyone is raving about this camera, Canon HG10. I bought one....and right out of the box it did not work. Froze up, and said: "Access Error." I did everything I was supposed to, charged up the battery properly, made all the settings correct (after reading the instruction manual thoroughly in advance, having downloaded it) and then try some test filming. On play back, the video stumbles, stutters and after a minute or two stops. Then a blank screen and the words "Access Error." I re-format the camera's hard drive, problem goes away for a few minutes, then starts again "Access Error." The instruction book's input on this malfunction is may be "condensation." The temperature inside and outside was 75 degrees. Condensation? Anyway, that would not last for one and half days the camera was indoors. The only other word on the subject from the instruction book is "Disk Access Problem." Well yes. What to do about it the instruction book doesn't tell you. I notice also the camera seems very very warm, not hot that it's uncomfortalbe to your hand, but much warmer than my other hard drive camcorder, a Toshiba. Thank goodness I purchased this HG10 camera from a reputable place, J&R Music World. The nice lady there said they would send me a pickup ticket by e-mail so I could return the camera to them. She said it would come by e-mail. Still hasn't, but it's the weekend, so maybe it will arrive on Monday. It isn't the fault of J&R, how would they know that Canon had sent them a lemon camera. Sure hope I can get another one, that works. Considering all the grief of life, this is a small disappointment, but I was looking forward to enjoying a nice camera. Very sad.</review>

<review id="8261">After having read all the books and seeing the movie I'd say buy the books and rent the movie when it comes out. The movie is mediocre but the books are good (if you can get past Bella being such a weak, wimpy character.  Not a great role model for girls.  She often faints, falls down alot and apologizes all the time. A bit of a doormat in my opinion) But if you like vampire/paranormal romance it is a must read. Chaste but romantic.</review>

<review id="8262">This looks like it would be wonderful for a quick cup of coffee or entertaining.  And it is if you and your guests don't mind weak coffee.  It does make good tea for my kids.  I can run two of the smaller brews through a single tea k-cup to get a nice cup of tea.  I wait a couple minutes between brews to let the tea steep in the k-cup.I've tried a few different "bold" k-cups and still found it to be too weak.  My problem is compounded by the fact that my preferred coffee cup holds 16 ounces of coffee.  Check the volume of your favorite cup first.  I use a Pfaltzgraff cup (not a mug) and was surprised to find that it holds 16 ounces.My only solution is to use the refillable filter and add my own coffee.  I use a fine grind and gently pack it into the filter.  This of course removes most of the convenience of owning a Keurig.  If you still want to buy one then go for the B40.  The more expensive models are not worth it.  Adding a smaller cup is a waste and it is fast enough that you don't need to program it.  Besides more features just mean more things to go wrong.</review>

<review id="8264">When I first bought the Sansa, I was under the impression that I would be able to use Windows Media Player to transfer files to my little player.  I was wrong.  Now, the only way you can get anything to work with the Sansa Fuze is to download Rhapsody.  So OK, I finally had it installed (two hours later) and it worked great for a month!!  I was able to download my music that was already on my computer to the Sansa Fuze.  However, now every time I turn on my mp3 player I get a note "Your subscription tracks have expired. Connect to your PC..."  I've never purchased anything using Rhapsody To Go, in fact I called to cancel my account the following day after the inital download.  I've been trying to figure out what I need to remove this annoying subscription note.  --------------I had to come back in and edit my original review.  I finally figured out how to remove the subscription notice so I'm happy about that and I'll probably keep the player.  I don't like having to keep Rhapsody installed in order for it to communicate with my computer.  The player itself is pretty cool, but I don't like having to use Rhapsody.</review>

<review id="8265">I received a defective flat iron.  It didn't work at all.  The manufacturer wanted me to spend $15 to send it to be "repaired."  Instead, I returned it to amazon.

<review id="8266">The Bad:It's too small for medium to large hands, unless you're a claw-gripper. The smooth default grip is nearly useless unless you are a child or have small hands --- it's too small to palm, and too slippery and "velvety" to claw. So you'd spend more time trying to hold onto the mouse than actually working or playing. Sadly, the smaller interchangeable grip is the grip of choice if you're a palm-gripper, when it was designed for claw-grippers. The center of your palm will never be supported, leaving a gap of air. The thumb-buttons are set too far back, causing me to retract my thumb before I can hit the "back" button with my thumb joint. This simply won't do for gaming. If I place my hand further back to accommodate the thumb buttons, then my palm won't be supported by the mouse at all, which makes me have to claw the mouse with my fourth and pinky fingers. The Good:Scroll wheel "MicroGear" works like a charm for scrolling quickly and stopping precisely at the portion of the page you want. This feature, along with Logitech's great mouse feet, makes it a little difficult for me to ditch the mouse. Conclusion:Since I still have my MouseMan Optical Dual Sensor mouse (Logitech), I periodically compared the grip comfort between the two mice. There is really no contest... the old old MouseMan's chassis is by far superior to the G9, for large and medium hands. There is definite palm arch support with the latter (and I suspect with the G5 as well). Whereas my hand (or any of my buddies') can't climb on the G9 at all and rest on top of it. Get the G9 if you are a clawer. For palmers, look elsewhere. I'll be returning this unit before it causes me joint damage.</review>

<review id="8267">I give the CPT-120 two stars for being cool to the touch and easy to clean crumb drawer. However, just above the crumb plate is the body of the toaster, which is plastic and built like a grille. This requires small crumbs and an obstacle that many crumbs have to get through to make it to the plate. This holds crumbs in the toaster body making it necessary to turn the toaster up-side-down to hopefully shake the crumbs out for cleaning.On toasting, after toasting an entire loaf of bread - sliced at different thicknesses for a test here's my findings.1/2+1/2 inch sized slices-settings 1-3: Only toasts on one end; Other end is still untoasted1/4+1/2 inch sized slices-settings 1-3: Still only one end; Burns the thinner slice1+1 inch sized slices-settings 4->: Still only one end toasted; Toasting quality uneven and unpredictableThis is an attractive model but not acceptable for daily use.</review>

<review id="8270">I've pampered my Flip Video Ultra and ordered it from Amazon on May 9, so I probably got it within one or two days later, Amazon usually provides FAST delivery.  But this camera worked fine during the Warranty period, but now it has has failed (September 20) and the display is stuck on the opening screen. So be careful folks.  These are made cheaply and mine didn't last but four months, conveniently (for Flip) right outside the warranty period.  So I'm stuck with a useless piece of junk that I've used very little.  I've pampered the camera, so this isn't the result of dropping it or any abuse.  It just failed.  New batteries didn't help. Wait till somebody comes out with something more reliable before you purchase one of these.  Or stick with a good digital camera.  I put a plug in for the camera when it worked on a blog I write at.  Now I'm going to have to give a quite different review to warn people about these things  But I've got a support request in with Flip.  Maybe they'll try to help me out.  Anybody else had bad luck with these cameras? Does flip offer support beyond the 90 day warranty? Or are thse things going to fail within a year?  I'd like to know the MTBF rate for these things.  Let me know in comments if you have any experience with these cameras failing.  I'm not getting the feeling that these are made solid like the Apple computer.  If Apple comes out with a video camera similar to this one, I'll spend the extra dough to get one. I've added a short comment on the famous website Bad Attitudes to express my disappointment with this camera.

So when a mouse has flaws, I know it.First and foremost, the left and right click buttons are so hard to click, that no matter how good you are, the mouse moves when you click them (unless have your mouse set on 800dpi and your sensitivity on 2/10 or something else ridiculously low, in which case you should be using a $12 mouse from walmart anyways). Try shooting something when your mouse moves involuntarily every time you click the button. Try clicking a small dropdown menu. Try clicking a particular line in a document. It's all the same, guaranteed the pointer will jump up 1 line above what you intended to click on.This problem can be solved by using the mouse on a surface that has zero squish, because then when you have to use all your muscle to literally mash in the buttons, the surface will not flex and cause the mouse to move. Even Razer's own mousepad, the Destructor, with it's cheap foam backing and ridiculous $40 price tag, squishes too much. This leaves you 2 options, an Icemat glass mousepad, which is like playing on a piece of sandpaper because of the rough sandblasted surface, or playing on your bare table, which is not a surface that this or many other mice move well on.It's a very comfortable mouse and looks nice, I'll give it that. Otherwise, it has zero positives. Anyone that likes this mouse is using it on less than 1000dpi and on a very low sensitivity setting and guaranteed is not playing any real games (Halo, CounterStrike, etc).I play on a Windows mouse speed of 10, 4000dpi, and 7 in the Razer software. My mouse moves 1/2 inch to full screen, and I have 3 friends who play on even faster speeds than I do, so I know I'm not the only one.My original Diamondback works better than this POS, it's slower, but at least the buttons were easy to click and it didn't move when you clicked them.</review>

<review id="8277">I bought this MP3 player for my husband and after he had it about 2 weeks it just stopped working.  I called sandisk and asked them if there was something i could try at home instead of returning it, but the guy said it's broken and that I should return it. My husband and I decided that we did not want another MP3 player from this company because it took us forever to download all his music and then the item broke.  So beware before you buy this product.  I saw one bad review before I bought the product and thought, what the heck, but I wish I would have listened to that reviewer.</review>

<review id="8279">I purchased this product (K9 Advantix 21-55 lbs.) on the advice of my vet.  Since it was vet recommended I didn't take the time to read reviews. That mistake led to many days of suffering for my dog...horrible itching, panting, erratic & frantic behavior, biting himself & us, hives on his legs & irregular breathing (in the short periods of time he was able to sleep). MY COMPLAINT IS WITH THE MANUFACTURER OF THIS PRODUCT for not listing the potential side effects.  Although, stupidly on my part, the "HAZARDOUS TO DOMESTIC ANIMALS" warning on a product I was about to use on my DOG should have clued me in. We'll take our chances with the fleas.</review>

<review id="8280">I had the same problem as another reviewer with losing connections. Customer service set me up with a return # and that's where their help stopped. I entered it online and never got any response that new units were back-ordered. After 2 phone calls, they could still not tell me when it would ship. In the meantime, they could not figure out whether they had received my defective unit- which they haven't after 2.5 months. They even charged my credit card for shipping a new unit without getting the old- BEFORE they shipped the back-ordered product. Another call to CS. They said accounting would email- they never did (but did take care of the charge). I finally recieved a new unit after telling them not to ship it if they were still claiming they didn't have the old one (since they'll again probably try to charge me for it). So, I complained to their CS email and got an auto email saying I'd hear back in 24 hours. It's been 8 days.So- I bought a $50 router from Amazon, sent it to Linksys, and they are going to charge me $73 for the new one I asked them not to send. This is the worst waste of time and the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I can't recommend Linksys to anyone and will never purchase anything from them again.</review>

<review id="8281">I purchased the Braun Pulsonic System 9595 in March 2008, and within the past week I've had issues with the cleaning system.  The shaver does not charge or clean, leading me to assume that the contact points the cleaning system uses to detect the razor are not working properly.  If I leave the shaver stored in the cleaning system, it seems that the battery is drained.  When I attempted to use the shaver this morning, it was completely dead, even though I only used it for approximately 5-10 minutes after the last complete charge.  I also found that the shaver charges when the AC adaptor is plugged directly into the shaver.I decided to call Braun customer service, and they will very apologetic about my issue.  They logged my issue in their system and asked me a few questions to better understand my problem.  I was informed that I would have to send the shaver out for repairs at a local licensed service station.  I was a little disappointed that I needed to involve a third party, but it seemed to be the only option.  My next call was to local service center (only licensed repair shop; not related to Braun), and they informed me that they are only open 9-5 on Monday - Friday.  Since I work full-time, it will be difficult to get to the service center.  The service center also told me that normal repairs take about 4-5 days.  What am I supposed to do without my shaver for about a week (if I'm lucky)?  If I could use a regular razor, I'd use that all of the time.Please keep in mind that I have been using Braun shavers for about 10 years, and this is the first issue that I have had with their products.  I am disappointed that a $200 shaver does not work after 5 months of use.  Other than this issue, I can not complain about the product.  The shave is great compared to my older Braun model.</review>

<review id="8283">I have owned three SanDisk Sansa M240 models that store 1GB. The first one I purchased with a in store warranty, but the player did not work right out of the box. So I took It back and got a second Sansa which developed an intermittent short within two months causing sound quality to diminish significantly. I took the second Sansa back and cashed in my warranty on a third SanDisk Sansa m240 1GB along with buying a second in store warranty. In two months my third SanDisk Sansa m240 developed the same intermittent short. I'll cash in my warranty on a different player this time.</review>

<review id="8284">Amazon states that the list price is $59.99.  That is the same as previous "Lost" seasons, which contained 24 episodes each.  So why should "Lost - Season 4" cost $59.99 for only 14 episodes?  Rip-off.  "Season 4" was excellent and proved "Lost" still had some legs, but what's the point in ripping off loyal Lost viewers?  No wonder there was a writer's strike last year.  Not only does Hollywood rip off its writers/creators, but it also rips off its viewers/customers.  Let's hear it for the writers who fought back the bloated Hollywood monster.</review>

<review id="8285">The online banking aspect has taken a horrifying step backwards.  It is far more time consuming and tedious then 07, and I was hoping for improvements in especially that area.#1  there is no more, "add multiple" #2  the "add transactions" window must close all other windows#3  the "add transactions" window is a hideous flash app with no search or predictive text in the 'account' fieldthat predictive text/search is probably the single most important time-saving feature of QB to me.It now takes me longer to add downloaded transactions (that don't automatically match) then it did to manually enter them from my statement.I desperately hope they fix these issues with updates, otherwise I will have to go back to 07.No, I will switch to Microsoft, or Peachtree, or anything other than Intuit</review>

<review id="8286">I am not a novice and I am sure I will eventually find the right download if it exists and figure out a way to install the drivers. However - this is not a product for anyone who is a novice or casual user or who just wants what they buy to work. I certainly did not buy into several hours of installation and setup when I bought this. Again, it does not support Vista out of the box. You must go to the website and find the driver -and guess what it wants a FTP user name and password to download their drivers (which by the way are still proclaimed as beta Vista drivers -go figure it is only 8 months post launch). Since the username and password is not found anywhere - be peprepared to send emails to support to get them to give you one so you can download it. Run it and it is not recognized, not authorized, not signed. This is not a overly burdensome series of warnings and errors to get through - but it is also not too much of a problem for these guys to get Vista certified if they would bother. Once the installation is complete you will get an error that the drivers did not install porperly - you ignore this also. Now there is no directory or icon on the destop with the programming software so prepare to figure that out - another set of downloads. I think you get the picture. It may be a fine gaming pad - but so far after several hours I still haven't been able to use it. I regret the purchase and having bought Saitek in the past - I guess I should have known they really don't provide decent support for their products.</review>

<review id="8288">What I got out of this book, I got from the first three chapters.  The rest was unnecessary repetition and excrutiating detail of each step outlined in the first few chapters.  I agree with the reviewer who said this could have been a much shorter book.Also, maybe I'm just not the organizing type, but if I had all my lists with me so I could use every spare moment to do my next action items, I'd want someone to shoot me.  Sure, I usually drag a book or magazine along somewhere in case I'm stuck waiting, but just as often I'll daydream, watch people, or smell the roses (sometimes literally).  In a way, I believe this down time makes me a more productive person than someone who's always riding herd on his PDA (see Carl Honore's book In Praise of Slowness).Of course, I'm also not exactly an executive, nor do I aspire to be.  Unless they have executive positions in smelling roses.So maybe if you're an executive, you'll find all this ueber-organization helpful to you, but to me, it was just a bore.</review>

<review id="8289">Waisted a lot of my time with this thing. The files get really big on the device, 20 minute videos may be 400mb in size. The problem was that we couldn't get them off of the camera. I used 4 different PC's, two with XP and two with Vista and still had the same problems. I had to go back out and re-shoot all the videos we took because of this problem. Small files would come off but not the big ones. Perhaps if it was on a removeable disk we could have gotten them off. We set for hours and hours working with this thing. Enjoy your trip back...</review>

<review id="8291">Woody Allen's best movie in years? Hardly. "Vicky Cristina Barcelona" is a familiar comedy-drama that coasts on the good will of its actors (notably Oscar winner Pen閘ope Cruz) while offering picture-postcard views of Spain. Despite the change in locale, there's really nothing new under the sun. The pretentious narration might have worked better if spoken by Woody himself. A definite improvement over "Scoop" but certainly no "Match Point."</review>

<review id="8293">for teenagers... gaimangirl "fangirl extraordinaire" review hit the nail on the head. Cheesy, so not original. So very similar to laurell k. hamilton Anita Blake series, maybe with a little Dark hunter thrown into the mix. I honestly would not let my children read the series. way too many good books for young adults that have depth and a original storyline. And the imprinting on a two year old is a wee bit creepy.

<review id="8295">I bought this product about 7 months back. Since then I can only say it has worked partially for me. The configuration SW that comes with it and user guide make the installation VERY EASY. I could get it setup in less than 15 min. But thats where all the good things come to an end with this router. First I had trouble where the wireless access would keep breaking for 4-2 sec every 3-5 min. This was extremely annoying since I would be loggout out of gaming sites in between the games. I called their customer service center. Representatives are NEVER available. Someone will answer the call and say that he is only an operator and technical support person will call me back. This happened for 3-4 times, finally I got fed up and blasted this operator, he immediately connected me to a rep. The rep was not of any use. Emails were exchanged for nearly 1 month with no resolution. Finally in oct-07 they came up with SW upgrade for router and I installed it and that seems to fix the issue.  Then recently suddenly the router cannot handle more than 1 link. I have 2 PCs. The first one once its active the second one slows down dramatically. Again I am trying to talk with technical support but they are not returning the calls. very poor experience. Stay away from this router. I got lured due to cost ($10 after MIR) but now I realize its not worth it.</review>

<review id="8297">I have used Turbo Tax since the early 90's.  I am very surprised at the steep increase in base price of premier as well as the charge for additional returns printed or filed online.Also, they promote the 'free' addition of state as a "xxx" value.  I live in a state that has no income tax and thus don't need it.  I would prefer a reduced price on federal with state as an add-on for those who need it.While I would like to continue using TT I will be taking a hard look at the competitors.</review>

<review id="8301">I bought this drive to sync files between my office and home computers, so I find it very mediocre for that purpose.And the Western Digital support was even worse.The drive requires the USB cable that comes with it in order to get enough power to work. I tried several cables I already had without success. Thus, you have to carry the supplied cable with you, reducing its portability but significantly increasing its hassle factor.I contacted Western Digital support, and they emailed me: "The drive maximum power draw is 1000 Ma. If the drive cannot draw this much power from the USB port the drive will not be recognized. To resolve the power issue we would recommend the power boost cable. The power boost cable connects to the drive and is connected to 2 USB ports. The drive will draw power from both of the USB ports. The power boost cable can be purchased from the phone support."This "power boost cable" requires TWO USB ports to work and would cost almost $17 with shipping, effectively increasing the price of the drive about 15%.I emailed back, saying "it is deceptive to promote something as self-powered when you know that it does not work on some computers."Their response? "Our drive is guarantee to work with the provided USB cable, since a greater length of a USB cable does attenuate the power strength causing malfunctioning of the drive. The drive is, as advertised, self-powered but in order to use it with longer cable you need to make sure that it will have the necessary power to operate."My advice: Buy a drive from another manufacturer.</review>

<review id="8302">I am amazed at the reviews on the Sony Webbie because most of them are missing the boat.I purchased this camera (Purple color is very cool) to replace a Panasonic DV601 I have used for family footage for several years. It was returned within two weeks after testing in a variety of environments.First the positive; It is very solid for a cam so small. It literally fits in your hand with room to spare, so if you have small hands, you should be OK, but if you have larger fingers to go along with those hands the buttons are a little tough, not terrible to push. It turns on instantly right when you open the viewfinder and accepts Memory Stick Duo for recording. It can go anywhere and fit in your pocket. Here endeth the positives.The most important aspect of a camcorder is image quality. The Sony Webbie fails miserably indoors and in low light to the point where the video is unwatchable with terrible orange overtones and substantial grain. Taping at night is out. Indoor daytime taping is only acceptable if you put the camera in low light or backlight mode and then just barely.Outdoor taping is the bright spot, as the footage is significantly better. However, the frame mode does make action shots somewhat jerky. All footage, when displayed on a 50" Samsung plasma are pixelated. I taped a school program in a well-lit gym and when we watched it pixels were visible in all shots, zoomed shots were awful. And speaking of the toggle zoom, it is too fast.When plugged into a G5 Mac via USB the camera shows up same as most digital still cameras and you simply drag and drop the files where you wish. To edit, the footage must be rendered and I estimate the render time to be 2-4x the length of the file. So a 2 minute clip may take up to 8 minutes.Bottomline: This is a cool-looking camera which may be fine for playing 4-inch square video images on YouTube, But it will not work for anything else.</review>

<review id="8304">We purchased two of these from Amazon based on the reviews. Loading the itunes software, buying tunes from the itunes site and moving stuff off our existing cds to the ipod were a breeze. Everything was great until we wanted to synch to a different laptop. Then we realized that itunes on the new computer couldn't see the contents of the ipod at all! Sure itunes itself could see what we purchased from the site, but all the other stuff we downloaded from our own library was essentially non-existent. There is information on how to move songs from one computer to another using the ipod as a harddrive but you need the old computer and new computer at hand to do that. If I had the old computer to synch with I wouldn't need to synch to the new one now would I? I can't understand why when you have itunes loaded on two computers you still can't move the ipod from one computer to the other and see what songs are loaded on the ipod. These ipods are rated very highly but more than likely from users who have one computer and never change to another computer. I wouldn't buy these again. I'd stick to the MP3/windows devices that work off of standard computer protocals. This Apple stuff is very quirky to work with unless you are 100% apple. They definitely march to their own drummer.</review>

<review id="8305">I really enjoyed the first three books in this series and I was really looking forward to reading "Breaking Dawn" Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. The book starts off well in the first few chapters but it just goes downhill from there.Bella and Edward should have been enough for each other. They did not need to have a child to "complete" them. If this was truly an epic love story, then Bella and Edward would have been enough for each other.The climax, well, there really was no climax. No excitement just a whole lot of characters standing around talking.The ending was just not what I expected. It was too "happy" and "perfect." I would have preferred the story to be full of tragedy and darkness.I was really looking forward to Bella FINALLY becoming a vampire but when she did, I could not enjoy it because I kept thinking how wrong it was for Bella to have that child. And who names a child such a silly name?I recommend that you read the first three books in this series, they are much better. As for this book, read it if you must only because it's the last book in the series. But this book is not worth buying. Just borrow it from someone instead.</review>

<review id="8307">I have been using this Linksys WRT54G2 wireless router for a couple of months now.  It replaced a Linksys WRT54G which suddenly stopped working (could not get through to the internet while connected wireless or hardwired).  I have owned 3 or 4 Linksys routers and they all seem to just die after 2 or 3 years of service.Back to the WRT54G2, I am experiencing random wireless connection drops.  This happens even while I am in the same room about 5 feet away with no obstructions in the way.  I would have to recycle power on the Linksys to get the wireless to work again.  It is quite annoying.  So, if you are looking for a wireless router with sudden, random wireless connection drops then look no further.  This router is the one for you.Seriously, I do hope Linksys comes out with a firmware patch to resolve this issue.  Until then, steer clear away from this little beauty.</review>

<review id="8309">I would make a video review, but I can't make videos. I bought The Flip Ultra on Amazon and received it two days ago.  The Flip is  fun to look at and easy to use...I will give it that.  Yes, the buttons stink and it is tough to turn on and off the "Shoot" button.  The Flip folks should know that the bar for controls has been set pretty high by other manufacturers.My big problem right now is that I can't do anything with the videos once I am done shooting.  I can't upload to Youtube - the program to upload them keeps crapping out.  I can't create them to use them for another online program - I am currently stalled at 99% right now.  There is an email for tech support.  Nothing else.  No phone.  No forum.  Perhaps I just got a bad camcorder.  I tried it on different computers.  I tried different USB ports.  I unloaded the software and reloaded it.  Still nothing.I am going to return mine today if it is not resolved.  I have spent a few hours screwing around with it - so the effective cost of my camcorder is now MUCH higher than $149.  I hope you don't get one like I did.To The Flip folks, please give more support options with your product.  This is unacceptable.  Charge a little more if you have to.</review>

<review id="8314">This is by far the worst hard drive experience i've had, and as an owner of a recording studio, i've had many.  Brought it home, unpacked the box.  Plugged it in via the included USB cable to my WinXP SP2 laptop.  It wasn't recognized in spite of the lights on the front turning on.  I then plugged it into my Vista laptop.  Still not recognized.  After this, i tried the firewire interface on my studio mac.  Finally, it came to life!  I plugged it in via the USB cable - still no luck.  Swapped the USB cable out and guess what?  The drive was recognized right away.  Great quality control!After throwing away the broken packed-in USB cable and using my own, i plugged it back into the Windows XP SP2 laptop and began copying all my media to this drive as i wanted it to be my central file server.  After i'd gotten about 500 gigs onto it, it started getting "Windows Delayed Right Failed" errors.  When these would occur, the file system would no longer show all of the sub folders and files.  After about two days of this, during which i had to plug and unplug the USB cable in order to get the drive to clear the delayed right issue about 3 times, the next time it ocurred upon plugging it in, i was informed that the drive was not formatted any longer.  The entire file system wiped out, and the drive signature lost.  I was unable to recover files from the drive and experienced total data loss.The data was worth much more than the $300 i spent on this drive.

Saitek support determined that the product was faulty and suggested that I return it for an exchange. I sent it back for replacement, well at least I got to use the replacement for 5 days and it stopped working also. I can't believe that this company is putting out such poor quality products. Go to the Saitek forum and do a search on X52 and you will find multiple issues with this product. I wish I had done that before I purchased mine. For the price they charge for this product you would think that it would be better quality. But then again, it's made in china. Make sure you do some research before you buy this product, it may save you some headache down the road. The only positive thing about the purchase is that Amazon was really great in exchanging the product and refunding my purchase.</review>

<review id="8317">I really loved the first three books. To begin with, twilight had this mystery and certain quality about it that just hooked you into it. Even it was a longer book, this was one of those times when you wanted it to be long. The length ended up being perfect with the first three actually. They unveiled certain things that were pertinent to the next book without tying everything together too soon. With Breaking Dawn I felt that Meyer might have been pressured to make all of her characters happy and to tie up any loose ends. I definitely wasn't expecting the length and how far she had gone to make sure everyone got their wish. I think that's what has made a lot of the classics so- classical. For example, Farhenheit 451 leaves you wondering where the main character is going to go and do now that his house and wife are gone and everyone is after him. Or The Great Gatsby and how a main protagonist is shot in the last fifty pages. It isn't pleasant but its more realistic and because the rest of the series had been about Bella and Edward getting everything they wanted I felt as though Meyer needed to put in something more, I don't know, real. Like in New Moon, it might have made readers angry at first but it would contribute to the overall tone and feel of the book. If I had one wish about this book, I think it would be that it was MAYBE 300-400 pages (no more) and that it was just about Bella and Edwards marriage, Bella's life of getting adjusted to being a vampire, and maybe Jacobs coming to terms with it. To me, a main character becomes more likeable when they are faced with loss and fear and sadness. When everyone gets what they want, you don't learn anything more about them. The two problems with this book? Length, for one, clutter, and not being able to let the characters have real problems like loss, death, fear, pain, sadness. I think I will just pretend that Eclipse is the final installment and maybe bury or hide Breaking Dawn.</review>

<review id="8318">As portrayed by Giametti, Adams seems so depressed I'm amazed Adams was able to accomplish anything.And hearing Brits try to speak American English is very funny.  One actor pronounces Maryland as "Mary Land," which always catches the English.  And shooting in Eastern Europe for Philly, etc. is always a joke.  Do producers think we don't notice?  Takes away from reality.  It would be nice for once if HBO used American actors to portray American actors.  or to film movies where they take place.Stephen Dillon, playing Jefferson, showed no such passion.  I have not read the book yet but I have read bios of Franklin, Jefferson, Lafayette and the characters were real.  What it hints at but does not show is the duplicity of America in its early stages.  Helping England steal Canada from French while begging France for money (helping to bring down the fall of Louis and Marie because the support for the American Revolution drained France's bank).  So much double dealling and the US was not good at paying back it's supporters.Adams was a difficult person to be sure but this series shows him as a loser and depressive.  I doubt that he was depressive.Abigail had wits and brains and a voluminous correspondence with Jefferson over the years and had Patsy stay with her before she went on to join her father Jefferson in France.  Adams and Jefferson in their last years wrote extensively and became close. This series, for all its length, does not capture the passions of the times and just seems another historical drama.Too bad this was not another Rome, full of intelligence, accuracy and brilliant acting.</review>

<review id="8320">I have had this item for a week and it is the most unreliable piece of garbage I have ever used. I have had to unplug it from my computer after every call and reinstall and set up or I could not make another call. I went to D-Link and installed the latest drivers, but this still has not fixed the issues. This unit is a wast of time and money.</review>

<review id="8321">In a few ways, the new metal MacBooks are actually an improvement over the last-gen MBs... aluminum is nicer-looking (IMO) than the previous white plastic, there's a more solid-feeling keyboard, new LED-backlighting on an all-glass screen (highly glossy though- reflection-and-fingerprint-city), new multitouch gesturing (like the iPhone) on a new all-glass trackpad that IS the button now (the whole trackpad 'clicks'- some will like this, some won't), and somewhat better graphics performance (though still far from hardcore gamer standards).But Apple's removal of Firewire is a real (and unnecessary) kick in the teeth, especially at the high price point. Besides losing Target Mode and super-easy file migration, many ppl with Firewire-only video cameras and/or audio equipment are being left in the lurch by this, and USB 2 and various Firewire-to-whatever adapters or hubs, present or future, are not solutions, as they can't do all the things Firewire can. These folks are now stuck with either having to move up to the very pricey MacBook Pro (at $2000 & up), or settling for the old 'Plastic'Book model, still around at $1000, with FireWire- though these will likely be discontinued pretty soon.The screen is also a bit disappointing, with a very limited viewing angle and far-from-the-best blacks and contrast.Bottom line: It's a quite pretty new MacBook with some nice minor upgrades and clever touches, but a less-than-great screen and one huge downgrade that didn't need to happen. Also, at $1600, it's quite expensive, even for the MacBook line. If all you plan to do with it is Internet, email, productivity apps and playing Starcraft 2 or WoW, then it's certainly fine. But, isn't much of the reason why MacBooks are WORTH the price premium the fact that you can do darn near ANYTHING with 'em? Not anymore. Prosumers will be especially disappointed, as Apple is expecting them to shell out quite a lot of money for a notebook that doesn't really support what they want to do anymore.</review>

<review id="8322">As I have been a loyal user of TT for more years than I care to count I was very happy that I read all the reviews before I ordered.  I have found reviews are my best friend.  I usually do my taxes as well as 2 of my children and my grandson's. Mine is the most complicated.  This year I would not have been able to complete mine without an added expense. I'm getting older and have now decided it is time to switch to a CPA.  The cost is not much more and I won't have the aggrivation.  Thanks to everyone who wrote a review.  You saved me.</review>

<review id="8323">I used to have a PC and used MS Money.  It was a very good program.  Now I have a Mac and I switched to Quicken.  This is a VERY BAD PROGRAM.  As an example, in 30 minutes this morning, it shut down on me 6 times!  One of those times it even corrupted the file so I had to go to a back-up copy.  I NEVER had any problems like this with MS Money.  Makes me actually wish I hadn't switched to Mac!  The only good thing I see is that Quicken's website says they have a 60-day money back guarantee.  I haven't tried it yet, so I hope I don't get problems returning it like I have using it!!!!</review>

<review id="8324">At first this seemed like a great pedometer but I started noticing that it would randomly stop keeping a step count and then start up again so I was never really sure what my actual step count was each day (this was within the first week).  Then it just completely stopped giving me a count at all, although it seems to still be functioning as far as toggling between steps, aerobic steps, cal, miles (it just doesn't count anything anymore).  I thought if I spent a little more on a pedometer, I would have a better product but this one didn't last a fraction of the time that the "cheap" ones given out at my work did.  I wouldn't recommend this product.</review>

<review id="8325">Constantly had to reboot due to lost signal. Other technical problems which are constantly mentioned in other reviews. Indian tech support while done well by other companies is extremely painful to use. If you need help ninety days after you purchase the product it would be less expensive to buy another router.Three days and two tech support emails (which were replied to at 3:00 am 17 hours after they were sent)later problem unresolved due to generic information sent from company. Case number given was useless. Netgear does not stand by their product and their customer service is the absolute worst and I can not stress this enough THE ABSOLUTE WORST I have experienced. I am not without computer and technical skills and god help anyone who encounters this company who is void of computer and technical skills. If you see this product turn around and run do not walk away.</review>

<review id="8327">Cons:-As was mentioned from the other reviews, this burner annoyingly cycles off and on.  I have to unplug and re-plug to turn it on again. You cannot disable it.  For me, this is the biggest deal breaker for this product.-There is nothing in the manual to show the features and specs except safety precautions.-You cannot use a large pan on it.  -Nothing to stabilize the pan but the actual heating coil.-You have to use heavy pans with good heat conductor at the bottom (like the copper bottoms pans).  If you use the aluminum teflon type, it will not sufficiently heat to fry anything.Pros:-Like the portability, size and weight.-Very affordable.</review>

<review id="8328">Bought it...loved it...2 months later the kettle leaked all over the counter...It's been more than 30 days since it shipped, so now I have to go through the hassle of trying to return to the manufacturer.

<review id="8330">I always have been lucky with online purchases and usually I am not too concerned when reading the occasional reports by unhappy consumers.So I ordered this nice looking device at a great price and was getting ready to be happy ever after. The 320 GB mini signature hard drive was shipped fast and without incident. Great design, small and light. It worked fine for two days uploading files from 2 different computers (Dell and a Sony), even with the limited power provided through one USB port only. However, when connected again to the first computer the next day, the computer froze numerous times trying to open the device. Finally, the device showed up under "My computer" but when trying to open it, the message "not accessible because I/O device error" appeared.When calling simpletech's tech support number and describing the story, I was told that the device was defective and needed to be repaired or replaced, which would take about 2 weeks.Luckily, the OUTLET company promised a full refund.</review>

<review id="8332">In spite of my friend's assurances that I would hate this series, particularly the overbearing stalkerish behavior of Edward, from the beginning, I really enjoyed Twilight through Eclipse.Breaking Dawn ruined it all.  Ew.  So much ew.  Just skip it.  Spoilers below.1)Bella doesn't want to get married, because she realizes how ridiculous it is to do that at age 18, but really all of the protestations are moot because of course the second she sees Edward's face at the perfect wedding, he was right all along.  SMeyer message: ignore society when they tell you it's hoosier to get married so young, even though the through-the-roof divorce statistics of teenage marriages are proof enough of what a bad idea it is.  Because true love makes everything perfect!2)Bella never even thought about being a mom, but her magical baby suddenly makes her want it more than anything else in the world.  She'll die for the baby, she loves it so much!  She's so selfless and wonderful, for never ever having an abortion no matter what anyone else said.  A real mother dies for her baby!  Good thing she's got a vampire handy to heal her broken spinal cord with his venom.3)I knew Jacob was going to imprint on that kid from the beginning, because it really would provide a revulsion trifecta.  Look, it is nothing but creepy that this fully grown man finds a mate in a newborn (no matter how Mary Sue that newborn is).  Insisting that it's entirely paternalistic in the beginning does not make it better SMeyer!  Jacob is like a second father to her now, but in about 7 years he'll be screwing her and that is just EWWWW!  Please, please, please don't write any Jacob/Nessie books.  Please. I just really abhor the messages this gives about young love and motherhood, because real girls don't have the options that Bella does.  I do not recommend this book.</review>

<review id="8333">This bug nearly cost me $1000 in tax savings because the software doesn't conform to IRS publication 590 rules.   According to IRS 590, if one spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work and the other is not, then the one that is not can deduct up to $4000 in a traditional IRA provided the MAGI is less than $159,000 for married filing jointly.  The software thinks that number is between $83,000 and $103,000.  Last year, the limit was $156,000 and I had no problem with a $4000 traditional IRA with last year's software.  They need to fix this quickly as many of us have to file early for college financial aid purposes.  I have been on hold for over an hour now trying to alert them to this bug.  It worked last year and all they had to do was increase the limit from $156,000 to $159,000. There were no rule changes.  I spent $150 to check this with a tax professional.</review>

<review id="8336">Contains spoilers so if you havent read the book watch out lolI expected so many things from this book and I'm sorry to say that I am really dissapointed. It didnt seem like any of the other books at all. I had imagined the possibility of Bella having a baby with edward but I always thought it would be unrealistic and when it happened I was dissapointed because I thought stephenie was better than that, that she would come up with a better story line. In a way breaking dawn was starting to seem like a really cheesy soap opra. I was horrified when jake imprinted on nessie (I hate the name they chose for the baby! I would have named her Dawn or not even included her in the book) Why couldnt jake just not have imprinted it would have made sence since they used to say all the time that imprinting wasnt comon. This probably distroyed all the Jacob and bella shippers because all of their history and hopes were just dismissed like they never ment anything and thats not fair!   I was ready for a big show down with the Vulturi and I was even prepaired for the possibility that one of the cullens might die *cough* Rose *cough* but nothing happened! I was hopping that Alice and jasper would come into the clearing with reinforcements and that the volturi would be taken down. That it would all break out into an epic fight but nothing happened. There wasnt enough Charlie, Billy and Alice in the book. Yeah it was mentioned at the end that charlie ended up with sue but I would have liked to read about them and see them develop. I hated Bella's vampire gift. It should have been more unexpected and spectacular.  I hate the message this book sends to people but since it has been mentioned in almost all the reviews I wont get into it. Bottom life isnt perfect nothing works out right for everyone, It's not realistic! I have read fan fiction that is better than this book!I expected way more form Stephenie Meyer!</review>

<review id="8337">I have purchased TurboTax for corporations for the past two years, along with TurboTax for personal use for well over 10 years now.  This year I took note of the Amazon prices for both product, and then H&R Block's product that combines S-Corp tax preparation AND personal taxes for almost half the price, and dumped TurboTax!  I'm still fuming over Intuit shutting down my Quicken after 3 years and forcing me to upgrade, so the high prices for TurboTax and previous decisions by Intuit sent me packing.</review>

<review id="8339">I bought Office 2007 with my new computer, a laptop with Windows Vista installed. Everything seemed to be fine, until I tried to use the extra services that make the new Office appealing to me (e.g. creating PDF documents, desinging brochures with Word, etc.) These extra features require an authentication online. I followed the procedures indicated by Microsoft, but a message tells me that the operation cannot be completed because my software is not genuine. Something quite strange, since I bought my computer and my copy of Office 2007 at PC World, a mainstream computer retailer in the UK. Besides this, Vista seems to have some compatibility problems with Firefox and my printer (a Laser HP, a very mainstream computer, legally bought as well!). If you use Firefox as your default browser, almost everytime you click to anything that requires Microsoft authentication the page won't load. With my printer I have to ask it to print twice so that I can actually prints, and one of the habits of ecologically-minded people (printed on both sides of a page) cannot be practised. It seems that, as a first user, I'm finding all the bugs of these (I don't doubt it) marvellous applications. I would be grateful if Microsoft had done some basic testings before their massive launching. For some reason, the hurries have sacrificed quality. And the subtle blocking of Firefox is quite painful. A concern about counterfitting is affecting the law-abiding users, which is the worst-case scenario I can imagine.</review>

<review id="8340">This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)      This movie had its funny moments, but nothing to earn the rave reviews I have read about it. Maybe I'm not enough of a Hollywood insider to catch all the jokes and references. It's really a horror film. Tom Cruise. Dancing around in a hairy fat suit. Grinding his pelvis. OH.  MY. GAWD!!! My eyes are still burning. I am going to need years of therapy to get that horribly creepy image out of my head.</review>

<review id="8341">PIECE OF JUNK.  I can't believe anyone gave this thing a good a review.  First of all, the coating on the plates is very inadequate.  Scratches very very easily.  The ridge on the edge of the plate is not high enough to prevent spills.  These spills seep under the plates and stain the unit where the coils are.  FURTHER, AFTER ONLY A COUPLE OF WEEKS THE COILS NO LONGER HEAT TO THE APPROPRIATE TEMPERATURE.  I purchased this after being lured by the infomercial.  I thought the quality looked good.  It's not.  It;s worth about $50-60 max.</review>

<review id="8345">This is one of those books I want to just kick myself for wasting my time reading. It was truly awful. Bella is annoying, cloying, manipulative, and apparently irresistible (???). The plot was convoluted and strange, to say the least. And the writing was reminiscent of a Harlequin bodice-ripper. If Bella screamed one more time, *I* was going to scream. She stifles screams. She screams in her sleep. She screams at the suggestion of something going wrong. Get over yourself, already. People promised me this series got better, but I can't believe it. I think I've had more than enough.</review>

<review id="8346">I bought this online instead of at the vet's office because it was 1/3 the price of the vet office Advantage. The vet said that you don't know were it has been made and that there are knockoff's that aren't the real product. Now I believe him. In his office the packaging is similar but the "Bayer" logo is on the opposite side of the package. But the truth is in how it has worked.Or not worked in this case. I have used Advantage before on my cat and one application does it. This product I have had to use a second application in less than a month and my cat is still scratching at fleas!

<review id="8348">I purchased this coffee pot for one reason, the heating plate which allows you to select your coffee temperature.  I do like this feature, however the rest of the coffee pot is too complicated for my taste.  In over 44 years of marriage I have owned a lot of coffee pots and this was the most expensive and hardest to operate.  The big complaint is that it is just plain messy!!  If you grind you coffee too fine it swells up and gets all thru the coffee pot and was a real pain trying to get all of it out of the coffeemaker.  We also have the black model which makes it hard to see the water level when pouring the water in.  Next time I will buy a more simple brand and less expensive. A longer cord would be helpful.  I do not notice any change in the taste of the coffee.  Your money is best spent elsewhere.</review>

<review id="8349">I decided to purchase additional cleaning units for my Brown Pulsar shaver. I had bought the shaver at Amazon, so I came back to make this purchase. It took 11 days until I received my purchase, later than promised. It came USPS and was charged $ 10.- which is excessive.I now did some research, and the price ( 23.50 for 1 unit = 4 containers)is about 25% more than with other dealers. Do not purchase this cleaner thru the reccomended dealer</review>

<review id="8350">I purchased this product and converted data from Peachtree.  I was under the impression that there was 30 days free support for installing and setting up a new company in this product.  The 'free' support is for instalation only.  I had numerous data problems with the converted data and the 'Conversion team' refused to help.  The conversion team will only help you to get the conversion tool to run; it won't help you clean up data that didn't convert correctly.  And free support doesn't cover these beginning issues either.  You have to buy a support plan to get any help at all from Quickbooks.  So if you plan to use Quickbooks I'd recomment that you start totally from scratch because conversion is difficult and unreliable and you can expect no support at all from Quickbooks.  Just to get a phone number to call you have to first go to their web site and fill out a form before they give you a number to call and a case ID.  But I found that the support consisted of telling me to buy a support plan and call back.  We would never have started this project has we known how frustrating it would be.  Peachtree is looking better and better to me the more I use Quickbooks.</review>

<review id="8351">This was a terrible product.  It has a stong detent in the center position that makes it a very unrealistic flight sim yoke.  I have had the CH products yoke for years and went staight back to it after trying the Saitek Pro.  I am much happier with the CH products yoke.  Also the way the Saitek mounts to the desk, Although sturdy, it completely gets in the way of any sliding keyboard shelf.  I had to dismantle my key board shelf to get set up with the Saitek, and then I had no where convientent to put my keyboard.  Don't waist your time with this one.  Buy the CH Products yoke instead, you'll be glad you did.</review>

<review id="8352">I knew better than to get an "all-in-one" wireless gateway and router, but my Netgear has been acting up and I thought it might be time to get a new router, one that was highly recommended from an industry leader and could stand up to regular abuse in an area with strong wifi pollution.While the administrative interface is good and includes useful tools and settings, I can't say that the actual routing software is any good.  After using it for a day, I left the unit turned-on but idle for the weekend and by Monday morning it wouldn't recognize (serve DHCP to) wired or wireless connections.  I cycled the power on the router and was able to use it for the rest of the day.  Overnight, between Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning, it decided to stop routing traffic to any wired or wireless connections although it was still handing out IP addresses.  Rebooting the cable modem and the router (multiple times!) didn't help and I ended up using a direct connection to the Internet.Take the advice of those who have gone before you:  this product is nothing like previous versions and is defective.  Regretfully, I have to return this to Amazon and will have to look to other solutions to provide both wired and wireless Internet access in my home.</review>

<review id="8355">Like many other reviewers, I experienced the annoying nuisance of the trimmer length setting decreasing with normal pressure applied while trimming. This is really a huge problem. I have cut my beard too short twice as a result of this design flaw. Norelco should send us out new trimmers, guys! I also agree that the vacuum is a waste, as unless it retains most of the hairs (which it doesn't), you still have to clean up the sink. Finally, having to manually change out the trimmer head to trim your mustache, ears, etc is a pain, and really not all that easy. I like the older design with a flip-out small trimmer head for the latter functions. The T980 is an example of "newer is definitely not better". Back to the drawing board, PLEASE, Norelco.</review>

<review id="8356">The native software DOES NOT connect to a public wireless network, verified by the techs at J&R when I returned the machine. It sees the network but goes no further. Somewhat experienced with Linux I searched and searched the Web (from a public desktop) and found that this has been a problem with Asus from its first release. What's the use of a netbook that can't reach the 'net?Tried to install easy-peasy (Ubuntu for the Asus EEE) from a thumb drive, as recommended on the web site for this distro. Ha! Got the 'non-system disk' message, which I thought had gone out with DOS.Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, it is a lovely machine - if I knew this problem was solved I'd buy it again in a NY minute! :)</review>

<review id="8357">I had looked forward to the final story in this series. However, Breaking Dawn seems to have taken a huge left turn toward an overdone scifi plot device. The fourth book feels barely connected with the previous three books at all. Bella is largely unrecognizable as the character we knew before. Edward is diminished almost to a secondary character. Issues and themes from the first three books are dropped or simply solved with the introduction of new backstory. Everyone in the book gets everything they want and the reader is left unsatisfied. If you've read the previous books of the series, the desire to see them to conclusion will be very strong. However, you may find yourself very disappointed and wishing you had stopped at Eclipse.</review>

<review id="8360">cute little item, great for children.  This was strictly an impulse buy; don't really know why I bought it - was fascinated by the ads and wanted to know more.  Sorry I bought it!</review>

<review id="8361">I purchased this because our Rat Terrier likes to get up on the bed. Still fairly young, he has no problem jumping up two feet of matress and bed frame but I've noticed he limps occasionally when jumping down. Unfortunately the steps are small with a very steep incline so the little dog ends up carefully stepping down until he reaches a tipping point. Once gravity wins, he has to try running but the small but deep steps make a smooth return to floor level into a clumsy descent that crosses the borderline between comedy and potential injury.Built out of the same material as most garbage cans, the too small and too thin pads are completely useless. The tiny rubber no-slip rubber feet work well enough until they fall off under the unimaginable stress brought by a 12 pound dog tumbling down the steps. After a brief inspection of the feet I also noticed that every time you extend the legs, the plastic is being bent severly by two round plastic bits that seem to function as a lock of some sort. Other than that, fine product.</review>

<review id="8362">I could not get updates for this product and I could not get my state download at all. For me, this year, TurboTax is an unusable & unreliable product. I've used it since 2002, but cannot rely on for 2008. Although TurboTax gives several options to look for solutions (ie - Chat, live community, email, call in), nothing worked to get my product to function properly - and I tried everything short of standing on one leg while swinging a rubber chicken over my head.My error message: "We have encountered an unexpected and serious problem and need to close the application..."TurboTax solution: "There is no solution available currently for this issue, however Turbo Tax is working to resolve it as soon as possible. Please accept our apologies and our offer to prepare your taxes Online. When you have finished preparing your taxes and are ready to file please contact us again and we will give you an access code so that you will not pay for the online product as well."While TurboTax did offer a solution, I did not want to do my taxes online. That is not what I paid for. That is not what I wanted.When TurboTax wanted me to submit a survey, the survey wouldn't process either?It seems to me that doing taxes can be frustrating enough without dealing with all of this.I have since bought TaxCut and that seems to work just fine - and I can get updates!</review>

<review id="8363">Do yourself a favor and buy the Sonicare Flex Care. The newer Flex Care models are an upgrade without the screw-on design flaw of this Sonicare model. This model has a hideous design where the saliva and other brushing liquids seep down into the inner mechanisms of the hand piece and pool up in a really disgusting way and requires you to take it apart and clean off inner crevices made up of metal and plastic parts. The new design eliminates all that slew of slime. This brushing action is fantastic, just like the new one, but this design stinks...literally.</review>

<review id="8364">Received shaver and it is wonderful. So smooth and improved over my existing Braun that I thought it was not cutting.

<review id="8365">1.  The keyboard has no distance between pinky keys like A or P and control keys.  I takes a lot of effort to retrain if you are a touch typest.2.  It runs very hot...you are told not to use this in bed or on your lap.3.  It is vastly underpowered.  It cannot play mpg videos from a usb stick or from an external DVD.4.  What takes 2-4% of the CPU on a modern Intel Core 2 Duo at 2.4 Ghz, will take 70-100% on this machine.5.  The fully charged, heavy, 6-cell battery reads 2 hours and 40 minutes...not four hours as claimed.This is an expensive web browser that cannot play YouTube without hickups.  Do not even think about Powerpoint Animations for Video!!!I am returning mine!Addendum May 9If you turn off everything, including indexing and Aero, the unit will play video using 70-100% of CPU.  Turn off the sidebar as well for this purpose.I had read that installing XP fixes performance issues.  However, getting the downgrade is not simple and not automatically provided by HP (if I am wrong here please add a comment to the review).  I have no intention of paying over $100 for XP a new license to install.Addendum May 21I have tried the Eee PC 900.  This is a much more chinsy and filmsily constructed machine.  It does not run as hot.  The keyboard is far worse than the HP 2133.However, it runs 2.5 times faster with XP and the standard configuration than the HP 2133.  Videos under any number of players never break up or take more than 20-30% of the CPU...whereas on the VIA chipset it always pegged at 100%.</review>

<review id="8366">I bought several of these for my daughter.  First, she was too small, so I swaddled her using a traditional blanket.  Then, they fit, but the fabric would stretch out during the night and she'd get her arms up and wake herself up.  Finally we spent the extra money for an Amazing Miracle Blanket.  It is AMAZING and worth every penny--instead of buying several of these, buy ONE Amazing Miracle Blanket and test it out.  You'll see that I am right!</review>

<review id="8367">This is our second Wahl clipper.  The first lasted 20+ years and my son took it with him to the Army.  This new one lacks the quality of the first.  The primary problem it the connection of the motor to the blade is plastic.  The plastic works loose from the blade, causing the clipper to stop working.  It requires a simple disassembly to fix the trouble (2 screws)but it is annoying to have to do it every 10-15 minutes.  The $10 Conair clipper that we bought from Dollar General work much better.  The extra doodads that come with the Wahl clipper are nice, but unnecessary.  The scissors are junk, and who needs 12 different guides?  4 guides are enough for our family anyway.  If I could return the Wahl clipper for a refund, I would.</review>

<review id="8368">Warning! Don't buy.  I bought this drive based on these excellent Amazon reviews...BUT my drive just died today ... after 3 only months!! It lost all my past backup files! I even gave my drive super-gentle care (it never left my desk or room).  So now I googled the words "FreeAgent Go Problem" & found THOUSANDS of similar complaints.

<review id="8369">I loved the look of this item and the sleek features that are included.  However, the burnt plastic smell is overwhelming and does not go away.  I bought this item and could not stand the taste of my tea so I brought it back thinking I got a bum one.  I exchanged it for an identical new one and was hopeful that perhaps it was just a fluke.  Unfortunately, I experienced the same problem again and after many washings and still the lingering taste and smell of burnt plastic, I am going to return this one too and try a new brand all together.</review>

<review id="8370">I bought this because the reviews were a bit better then most. Had no problems hooking it up, set up, etc.  Everything looked good until a week latter it started making horrendous sounds and stopped working all together.Luckily I saved the drive this one replaced, and bought another one (another brand) which so far is working perfectly.This is the first drive I have ever had that died.This is just my experience, maybe a fluke...but it seems the only tests manufacturers do on their products is in the field when it fails. Had no problem returning unit. Only risk is your data, so always backup or look at alternative backup sources, (luckily I did).Ensure you understand return policy also.</review>

<review id="8371">At first, I thought this was the greatest thing ever.  I was getting GOBS and GOBS of hair from my Golden Retriever pup.Then, we visited my puppy's breeder. She asked me what I was using to brush my pup - I proudly told her "The Furminator!"  She then told me that her coat was all ripped and her hairs broken up. I was mortified!  (and also somewhere wondering why her coat was not as soft as I thought it should be!) This *brush* was actually ripping and destroying my puppy's coat!  I immediatley stopped using it on my pup - and realized that getting every hair out is not as important aas getting the LOOSE hairs out.  Back to the slicker brush.</review>

<review id="8372">Got this a few days ago. Set it up and off I went. Worked pretty well for a netbook. Just getting comfortable when it went dark. No power. Battery dead, wouldn't charge, PC wouldn't run off AC. Couldn't take any files off. Probably a faulty AC power cord, since it wouldn't even start on AC power (but it could be some other computer component). (I did check the electrical outlet and made sure the AC adapter was plugged together properly.) Sent it back today. Won't buy ASUS again. I know this stuff happens, but getting non-working electronics in the mail is highly annoying and seems unnecessary to me. Too bad ... it seemed to be perfect for my needs, but I couldn't tell for certain, since it didn't work long enough. Will buy something else at Amazon, though, since they made the return painless and quick.</review>

<review id="8374">I bought this external hard drive from IOmega through Amazon. I had it for less than a MONTH before it failed.I contacted customer service. Told them what happened and they said it was the power supply that was the problem. (It clearly wasn't.) They said they would send another power supply. Three weeks go by. Nothing.I contact them again. No explanation for what happened before. This time, they express the power supply.... Which of course, makes absolutely NO difference.Contact them *again*! This time, they acknowledge that maybe there is a problem with the hard drive. They'll replace it ... but I have to pay to send it back.Sure. Why not charge the customer for a defective product from your company after ignoring a request for service for three weeks?</review>

<review id="8377">At the moment, I can only give this product 2 stars for a typical experience.  The current profile editor is absolutely terrible.  Is it a coincidence saitek was recently bought out by madcatz and now the profile editor has gone to trash?  I can only speculate.To make this a 4.5 star product, search and download the old SD5 series profile editor and you'll have a much better experience.  I know the sd5 works with windows XP.  I believe it may not work with Vista.The hardware is excellent, but because of the current state of the software, I'd say stay away unless you have XP and are willing to track down old drivers.  Madcatz really needs to fix the new profile editor.</review>

<review id="8378">I am an IT product manager for a large nationwide AV technology company. I specify and recommend IT products to our many locations. I will no longer recommend Apple products based on my own personal experience. This laptop has given me nothing but issues over the 1+ year I owned it. I won't go over the minute details, but basically it was in for repairs at least 5-6 times to replace the battery, hard drive, random reboot, discoloration on the plastic, SuperDrive, etc. The last issue I had was just this week. The screen began to flicker constantly and I was about to take it to my local Apple store when my wife accidently spilled water on the keyboard. As I said before, the logic board (motherboard) was already defective before the spillage. Because of the water damage, even though I have AppleCare, the repair is not covered--Apple wants close to $1000 for parts/labor to repair a system that at this point, it's not even worth that anymore. I can't believe the Mac "genius" even suggested repairing it when a new unit costs that much.I have always been a big Apple fan for many years and have owned many of their products. I have bought and recommended Power Macs G4/G5, MacBooks/Pro, iMacs, CinemaDisplays, MacPros, you name it! Many of our locations complain about the premium price that our company pays for an Apple product as opposed to a Dell system. After the way I've been treated by Apple, I no longer feel that the premium price for a Mac system is worth it.</review>

<review id="8379">Although this grill has all the design elements I wanted - easy to use, quick to clean, and very compact, it is very cheaply made.  After just 3 uses, One of the joints that adheres the top to the bottom broke.  Had I not reacted quickly, I would have been burned.  We were very fortunate that our child was kept away from ever using it.Upon close examination, we found the weak joint to be made of some sort of brittle, composite material, NOT metal.  It's such a disappointment to see such a terrific design implemented so poorly.</review>

<review id="8380">WARNING! A FEW SPOILERS!!!I'm a teetering fan. Which means I read the books for fun and own some but I also criticize it for its plot and how the author places too much importance on looks. And it also means I have no qualms with reading spoilers.When I read them, I found it hard to believe. Seriously? Jacob imprinting on a baby? Edward even having the ability to be inpregnate a human? Bella turning into a invinsible newborn who somehow doesn't thirst for blood? Nessie?It all sounded like bad fanfiction.But then I thought about it and realized it's just what Stephenie's capable of doing. From day one, Bella was a Mary-Sue like heroine with her true love (the impossibly hot and perfect) Edward. Bella is not an ordinary girl. No matter how much Stephenie emphasizes it, she is not ordinary. And Edward is just an overprotective living Ken doll.I have not yet read the book but I am ordering it anyways. Being a teetering fan means I'm free from the feelings of dissapointment and anger many fans are experiencing and I am able to laugh and enjoy the ride.But let's just hope there's no more flowery speeches about love or long descriptions of Edward's gorgeousness. Which I'm assuming will be there anyways in great quantities.</review>

<review id="8383">I was very excited to receive my new mini.  Shipping was very fast!  I had high hopes for this product but now that I have had it for a short while, I don't even bother to use it anymore.  While the size is excellent, the battery that sticks out and at an anlge not only makes this computer heavy, it makes it hard to find a case to fit it in.  The 2 problems that I have with this computer are 1) Its incredibly slow and 2)it will not shut down properly.  If you want the computer to turn off you have to hold down the power switch for 5 seconds.  The problem with the speed is not my internet source.  I have used the wireless feature in several locations in my neighborhood and other areas and it is just a slow computer.  It takes several minutes to load a website.  I guess this machine goes into the box of products that look great in pictures and sound great in the discription but just don't work.  I should have put the $350.00 toward a real mini.</review>

<review id="8385">I bought this camera because the product marketing promised 2 things: 1) a simple, lightweight video capture experience; 2) an equally simple  video-transfer-to-computer experience. The company delivered on Promise 1, but failed catastrophically on Promise 2.  Here's a sample of our experiences with the Flip's software:1) First try: software booted up and told me to go get a firmware update from the Flip website.  OK.  I get to the update site. The firmware isn't yet available for the Mac.  Bummer.  There's no place to sign up for an email alert to let me know when the update's ready; I'm instructed to check back in "about a month."2) Meanwhile, I tinker with the software to see if there's anything I can do while waiting.  The FlipForMac application freezes while I'm exploring it. I force-quit.  The computer no longer recognizes my camera.  I disconnect it.  The camera won't turn off and can't get itself back into video-taking mode.  I remove and reload the batteries.  Camera comes back alive and seems to be working normally, but my trust is shaken. 3) A month later:  The firmware update's available.  I download, install and run it.  Ten minutes into the installation, the update fails with a big error message linking me back to the Flip website.  The website tells me to remove the batteries from the camera, reboot my computer and try again.  4) I do that.  The update fails again after 10 minutes.  The Finder on my Mac locks up for 5 minutes.  I lose patience. 5) Remove camera from computer.  Remove batteries from camera (its interface is frozen again).  Hard-reboot computer to get out of whatever bad loop the Finder is in.  Plug in camera again.  Click on FlipForMac application icon.  Get error message saying the application icon I clicked on "...is not a Director file."  Nothing else happens.  I can't force-quit the application or eject the camera.  OS freezes up again. 6) Fueled by morbid curiosity, reboot. Throw away installed FlipForMac software and restart.  Plug camera back into computer.  Try to reinstall the software from the camera itself.  The application icon *on the camera*  appears to have gone dead.  The camera goes dead too -- it won't respond to attempts to eject.  7) Lather, rinse, repeat.  8) Give up.  Come to Amazon. Write product review. This wasn't just an aggravating waste of time, nor was it one of the rare frustrations of using a Mac (see other reviews from Windows users -- XP and Vista both -- who've had bad experiences with this software). Regardless of what OS you're using, there are some basic things that even minimally competent professional software should never do.  - It shouldn't get halfway through an installation before it fails. - It should never lose track of its own state ("I'm dead.")- It should never lose track of its own initialization sequence after dying ("....this is not a Director file...").   - It shouldn't take the rest of the operating system down with it when it goes.- It shouldn't leave a user with the impression that the software is a rickety house-of-cards held together by luck.This company has invested its resources in excellent marketing and good industrial engineering (the camera itself). The software -- a big chunk of the user experience -- is clearly an afterthought.  Responsible software engineers spend a lot of time thinking about edge-cases that will mess things up and figuring out how to handle failures gracefully.  Those software engineers are expensive, and the Flip company has decided not to bother with that expense.  You can drive over a bridge a lot of times before it falls down.  A lot of people are going to get to the other side just fine, and those people are going to give their experience with the bridge a decent review.  The mark of a responsibly engineered product is how decently and gracefully it recovers from failure.  When it fails, the Flip's software fails horribly and it doesn't recover at all.  I worry about what else it takes down with it.  Potential Flip buyer, beware!  Will *you* be one of the Flip users who has a catastrophically bad experience with the software?  Are you willing to take that chance because the product and its marketing are cute?  I wish I hadn't.</review>

<review id="8386">I was generally happy with the monitor, but the plastic parts on the strap started breaking off after less than 10 uses.

<review id="8388">Just sent WRT54G, ver. 1.2 back to Linksys under RMA.  It is almost cheeper to throw the unit away.  Linksys tech. support marginal at best.  Would never have gotten it to work without BellSouth tech. support.  Each time they got it working it crashed within a week or so.  I finally got someone at Linksys that spoke English and she authorized RMA after a few simple test.  Now I am out $10.00 return postage for a unit I that I could buy locally for $69.00 with rebate.  Hopefully the replacement unit will be ver. 2.**, if not it goes into the trash.</review>

<review id="8389">I was buying diapers for my 17 month old daughter at Target when I saw these for the first time. I was SO excited because her size 6 diapers are getting to be too small, but she's not ready for potty training yet, and I didn't know what I was going to do! I tried them out as soon as we got home, and unfortunately I was pretty disapointed because they are still small on her. She is a BIG girl though, she weighs about 50 lbs. (she's vegetarian and eats very little junk food, so I don't know why she is so big. I think it may be because she still nurses a lot at night, but I can't say for sure). The straps were hard to fasten around her belly because they are too short, and they don't stick very well either. She ended up walking around with one side unfastened most of the time. So while I'm not going to buy these diapers for her again, these would probably work great for a thinner child. As for us, I'm going to stick with her Luv's size 6 diapers because they fit better, and they're about half the price.</review>

<review id="8390">I had this controller for about a 3 weeks before the right analog stick went haywire. Try buying the ChillStream or even a 360 controller. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</review>

<review id="8391">I bought this model KT2651XWW Epicurean 6 qt machine for myself as I have been drooling over getting one for years.  I used it 3 times for christmas and then pulled it out this year to find it does not work. It does not even turn on.  I am really disappointed; it does have metal housing and feels like a workhorse but wants to be out to pasture way before it's time.  I am in process now of attempting to get it repaired or a motor to fix it myself.</review>

<review id="8392">The only people I would recommend this product to are my enemies. The first router didn't work, so I returned it and replaced it with the same product. The second router worked perfectly for a day before the Internet connection began to drop out after five minutes.In efforts to fix the problem I tried firmware upgrades from Linksys and third parties with no success.Couldn't uninstall the drivers to try a clean reinstall and tech support's "second tier" help never called me back (over a three day period), despite my prodding. The one time I did get a call back, it was a tier one person who asked if I managed to solve the problem myself (I hadn't).Another tech support person had an attitude problem and refused to believe that the router was causing the Internet drop outs and blamed my ISP, despite me insisting that wasn't the case.Terrible customer support for a terrible product.</review>

<review id="8393">I purchsed this item in November 2003 and had just called customer support in March 2004 to find out why the router keeps disconnecting all of a sudden. First of all I was put on hold for about 20 minutes and then after being transfered from one department to another I was informed that they will not support my call because it is over their 90 day support period and that I could either email them or pay for the service. I then emailed them and was just sent a generic response to my issue.If this is the kind of support you want then I urge you to buy Netgear products but let me tell you that I also own a Linksys router and they still support my calls after 5 years. I will never purchase a Netgear product again. By the way they route all their calls to India to save cost.</review>

<review id="8394">I tried the wrt54g and after 4 days on the linksys chat line 2 phone calls and 1 replacement it would not stop resetting itself  I upgraded the firmware and tried everything they had to fix the problem and it still doesn't work. It will work for a couple hours but when I wake up it says "you have changed networks" then when you run the advisor it won't even recognise the router. This junk don't waste your time or money. Get a wireless router from your internet provider and save yourself a big headache.</review>

<review id="8395">From the information provided we did not realize we would need a DVD drive.  Our machine has a CD rom, but the program would not load.  So in addition to the cost of the program we had to spend money on a piece of hardware.</review>

<review id="8396">The router works fine for the first several weeks until it starts dropping signals, losing connection, requiring one to power-cycle the unit every five or so minutes. This is darn annoying considering you have to move back and forth (to power cycle the router) from the couch to the room where router is. Call me a couch potato, but wasn't it the sole purpose of having a wireless network, so you don't have to be literally sticking to a router?I'm about to ask for a fourth replacement unit from Linksys, but my expectations are pretty low.  The same symptom has been found across all the replacement units and the original purchase.This afternoon, I called Linksys tech support and asked if I could get a refurb v3 as a replacement, if, and only if they have a v3 unit available. The answer I got was 15 seconds of silence with background noise, and then.Click.This version (v5) is a cheap knock off of the good old v3. Don't have the expectation that the same looks will give you the same stability/performance.</review>

<review id="8397">The Linksys WRT54G2 failed (froze up) after 3 months w/ no issues.  This is my second Linksys router and I am fed up.  Others on their website reported the same problem w/ this model.  Their website has problems as well.  This model had all the features I wanted but if it can't work for longer than 3 months it is not worth $5.  Very disappointed.</review>

<review id="8398">This product is absurd.  I can not believe that it is supposed to be the leading brand.  I used it because it was recommended by my vet when my cats got fleas, the fleas came back after a week!!  When I did some further research on the frontline site, they say that there guarantee is for after three months of use.  That is how long it takes to break the flea breeding cycle.   Frontline kills adult fleas and flea eggs but not fleas in the larvae stage, which is the middle stage.  So any of those fleas will emerge as adults and you have the problem all over again.   If you already have fleas you should definitely  go with Advantage that kills the larvae and adult stage.  Frontline is only good as a prevention and who wants to pay that much for only preventative purposes.  I encourage you to do your own research and not waste your money on this product that is definitely lacking.Go with Advantage</review>

<review id="8399">I was disappointed with the production values on this "Limited Time Only" Platinum edition.  The colors seem gray and washed out, the sound seems ... uhh ... gray and washed out, the animation seems ... hmmmmmmm ... jittery and fractionated.  Ok, maybe I got a badly burned copy and Your Mileage May Vary.  Unfortunately, this effort seems about what I'd expect from the "Tease 'em Today, Promise 'em Tomorrow" consumer engineers that pass for Eisnerville these days.  Pixar does it right.  Compare the burning sea colors in Finding Nemo with this, e.g.  Another thing, if you're a BIG FAN of the team that did Pocahontas you'll love L.M. all over again.  To me, it just seems very dated.</review>

<review id="8400">I just want to echo what a few other people are saying about this "company". Just try calling customer support (888-711-6662) before you buy. I've called and have been put on hold for HOURS only to be disconnected EVERY time. I have yet to speak a live person and so far none of my emails have been answered. And I haven't subscribed to this service yet. If this is how they treat their prospective customers, I can imagine how they treat their subscribers once they already have their money.</review>

<review id="8401">I purchased this because I wanted to have something that could help me write and use the keyboard successfully at night without light on and keeping others awake. I am a hunt and peck not a real typer anymore. The trade off for visibility at night and day time is a trade off. You give up your ability to see the keys in regular light by two thirds to gain sight in dark by 1/2. granted it works well, though I Have not tried all features yet. Its size isn't all that much bigger than some other modern keyboards I have used. I have already hit the caps lock a few times while hitting "a" though. The very least they could have done was made and outline in white paint of the letter around the clear part then you could see the letter better. For typers this should present no problem but again if real typers feel the keys why do they need it lit up anyway? I will try it for a while but may return it. Right now I have to have the backlight on all the time and that is not what I wanted when I bought this. Right now I have a headache from using it in regular light.</review>

<review id="8402">Just bought Quicken Premier 2009 because 2006 couldn't be made to print in  a 64 bit environment.  Waste of money!  It won't print either.  The setup is a wireless network with three other computers; the printer is connected to a desktop; the 2009 Quicken installed on a laptop.  Everything prints but the 2009 quicken.  At least 20 messages have gone back and forth with Quicken technicians (?) with no resolution.  They will not say it's because of the 64 bit software but that's the only difference.  Why can't they develop a simple fix?  About ready to try Money.</review>

<review id="8403">I've been a Quicken user for a long time.  Intuit used to be a great company - great products and services.  Apparently, corporate greed has taken over.   I don't own this 2009 version.  I have 2006, but have been informed that I must purchase 2009 if I want to keep downloading bank statements.  The 2006 box did not contain an expiration date. So now my choices are supporting unscrupulous business practices or spend lots of time and energy converting to something else. I agree with the reviewer that calls for a class action lawsuit!</review>

<review id="8404">Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)      Having read all of the positive reviews, I wonder to myself if we're talking about the same product.  I admit to being a blade user but all the "close as a blade" advertising made me decide to give it a try.After getting the nearly impossible packaging open the first thing that sours me is the lack of some kind of rechargeable base or stand I can put the razor into when I'm done.  It doesn't seem like too much to ask for considering this is a $100 product and leaving the razor and a power cord lying around is a hassle.  The Norelco looks and feels nice in my hand with a nice big on/off switch and it's noticably quieter than the Norelco I owned years ago.  The one difference I see now is the entire base rotates up and down as opposed to just the blades in my old shaver.  But looks aren't as important as performance in my opinion so let's talk about the shave.First let me say my skin probably hasn't been toughened up by constant shaving.  Being self employed, my face has lived the life of luxury as shaving is mostly optional and, when done, it's with an electric trimmer for a 5 o'clock shadow.  A blade is used only when necessary.  I flip on the Norelco, go to work on my shadow and... YEEEOOWWW!!!  Ripping and tearing through my face like a hatchet through the jungle.  It's a bloody mess.  More pain when I put on the aftershave.  I get irritation using a blade but this is so bad the irritation doesn't stop even after the aftershave stop burning.  They said it'd take a while (as long as a month) for your skin to 'adjust' but they didn't say you wouldn't be able to show your face in public.  What was shaving with a Norelco like?  Like falling off a motorcycle at 50mph and hitting the pavement, face first.Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I stuck it out for a full month.  Future sessions weren't as bloody but they sure did hurt and irritation continues to linger even after applying aftershave.  The frequent yank of hairs being ripped out is not the most pleasant feeling in the world.  Worst of all the resulting shave is certainly not as close as a blade.  I might look shaved but I still feel the bristles.  It's a laborious process as well, rubbing over the same hairs over and over as a lot gets missed.  Shaving with an electric takes longer than a blade even with the added time spent applying shaving cream and rinsing off.  I gave it the college try but after a month I'm sticking with a blade, thanks.  Gillette's Mach II and Mach III razors and some quality shaving cream have done me fine.  I'm not saving any time using an electric and I'm in a lot less pain using a blade.</review>

<review id="8405">I bought this upgrade because I thought it would let me share my contacts. It says so on the box, but it doesn't. It works just like the old contacts which you can't share with others except if you export it. No live sharing. Why couldn't they make it so I could put the file on my server? Or on a secure site? Then all my office can work off one contact list.50% or more of the time the business contacts can't be found when you search for a contact. It's like the business contacts is an add in that doesn't work with Outlook. Or you add contacts, save it, email to the saved email address and then go to find the contact later and it is gone. Also, lots of times when you try to SEND, the email won't SEND, it stays in the outbox. And repeatedly you open and hit the SEND button but it won't change to SEND status. Now, if you leave it in the outbox, sometimes that fools the program into letting you send other email. Or sometimes you can FORWARD and SEND.. Geez, what a waste of money this upgrade was. We won't be using it on any of our other computers and we haven't bought it on the new computers we have ordered.</review>

<review id="8406">I bought this to back up my hard drive.  Go figure.  Makes sense, right?  Well when I plugged it in, there is software pre-installed.  That is kind of cool.  I let it do its thing.  Then it asks you which folders to back up.  I told it, and it started copying all my songs, pictures, documents, etc.  That was easy (though it does take about 12 hours).The pre-loaded software is junk.  It doesn't actually explain WHAT it does.  Worse part- it is not compatible within operating systems.  My work computer uses Vista, my lap top has XP.  I called tech support and after being on hold for 10 minutes they confirmed that it only works from XP to XP or Vista to Vista.  In my opinion, the info should be accessible from ANY computer.The directions that come in the package are entirely useless.  Here is what it says:  "Should you encounter any problem, please do not return this product to the store before carefully reading your use manual."Good advice.  I did that.  Here is what the user manual says (via diagrams):-Your product contains a drive, a cable, and a user manual-Plug one end of the cable into the drive and the other into your computer's USB slot.-On your computer download the softwareTHAT IS IT.  It is entirely useless.The reviews made it seem like this is a good product.  I thought Western Digital was a good company to buy in to.  I was wrong.  You could tell they may've made a good product, but they didn't think it all the way through.I'm not sure if I made this clear, but seriously- save your money.  Buy something else.lovenick</review>

<review id="8407">The story-line is so totally paint-by-numbers, one feels that if the producer / director should stay home, any administrative assistant could finish the movie. The wasting of Hugh Jackman, who starts off the movie with a ridiculous slapstick fight sequence is bad enough, but when Nicole Kidman, so brilliant in Cold Mountain, is forced into sophomoric dialogue amidst a dull and boring plot, you can see why Russel Crowe bolted on this loser.Yes, the rolling landscapes are nice, but National Geographic i wasn't looking for.</review>

<review id="8408">As a college student, I needed a way to carry my files from one computer to another. The computers provided at my campus only let one store so much information before forcing one do delete already-saved files to make room for more. Needless to say, I bought a flash drive.     At first, the U3 sandisk cruzer micro 2G flash drive was perfect. I put it into one of the USB ports on my dorm room computer, and a new software I had never seen popped up. It allowed me to create a password, store files, and eject it without any problems. Sometimes before ejecting though, a small box would pop up saying that I couldn't eject it because there were programs still running by it, with no programs running at all on my computer. It didn't bother me much, because I would just wait until the next morning and it would eject just fine.     However, two months after buying it, I needed to transport a program to my Engineering class. To my dismay the flash drive showed no signs of even existing upon plugging it into my computer. The little light would not turn on to show that it was working properly, and the removable disk file (usually F) was not even showing up in My Computer. Panicking, I turned to the company for help, but they only gave me a long detailed instruction sheet on how to get the program to run properly. I don't need the program to work, I need my flash drive to work! I visited several tech forums for help, every time finding out that there are several others with my same problem. Yes, I ejected the drive properly every time. Yes, I have tried four different computers, with no results. My roomate has the same exact drive and hers works perfectly in the same computers I tried mine.      I have no idea if it was just a defect on my drive personally. There is a warranty on this product, but why would I want the company to ship me another one when it could possibly end me in the same predicament as the first? Others may find no problems with their flash drive, but as for me I will replace it with one from another company.</review>

<review id="8409">'The Secret' purports to have been hidden by the rich and powerful down through the ages, lest the downtrodden put it to use and tell those who have used it to maintain power over them to take a hike. Of course, this is preposterous. 'The Secret' is nothing more than religion rehashed for a secular world and simple minds. A passage comes to mind from the New Testament that pretty much sums up what is "revealed" in 'The Secret':Mark 11:23-24 23) "I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him. 24) Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours." Now, I doubt if Jesus was talking about praying for a Rolex Daytona watch or a new Ferrari when he said this, but what the heck. God's cool, so go ahead and ask. Just don't be too disappointed when, instead of that Rolex, you wind up pushing a shopping cart around the local city park because God is spanking you for being such a shallow soul.You see, unlike the purely physical universe that the show's philosophers and "metaphysicians" (I love that -- what, did they go to "metamedical" school?) are describing in their presentations, the REAL universe we all live in has another law operating in it -- the law of '$#!^ Happens'! All the positive thinking in the world isn't going to stop that OTHER guy who had a really bad day from going Postal on you. And I have always "visualized" me and Sherilyn Fenn hooking up for a hot date, but damned if it just hasn't happened! God knows we'd be soooo good together... Now, I gave the DVD 2 stars because it is certainly better to think positively than negatively, as generally speaking this will produce superior results. But the "Law of Attraction" isn't really a law like the Law of Gravity, in spite of what they say on the DVD. It's more of a guideline, with a lot of exceptions, that works generally well as long as the aforementioned Postal worker and you don't cross paths while you're on your way to test drive your new Ferrari.</review>

<review id="8410">I bought a refurbed. Ultra for 118. and it worked mostly well for about 3 months- the limited warranty expired after 1 or 3 months. The audio/video got buggy and started to be out of sync. Then the view finder got streaky (colored lines).  And finally, after 4 months, the camera died. Definitely recommend avoiding refurbished cameras. Buy a new one with 1 year warranty or purchase extra protection. This toy breaks down fast.</review>

<review id="8413">I have to agree with all these reviews already posted. I was getting error messages for Intuit stating that I would not be able to download stock quotes after a certain date, so I ordered a new copy of Quicken for $50 thinking it would be an upgrade. To my amazement, it is exactly the same as Quicken 04, no real developments. I feel very cheated by Intuit. If 04 was only going to be good for a couple of years, they should have disclosed the fact in the first place. If they are going to squeeze money out of loyal customers, I would at least expect and improved product. They are making a real mistake here, as their credibility is now zip. I have been buying TurboTax every year, and have been a loyal Quicken user for many years, but now I think I will look for something else.</review>

<review id="8414">I purchased this to replace a sony flash drive I lost.

<review id="8415">I have used Quiken for Windows in the past and have always been very impressed with the way the product worked and how easy it was to use, but I have to say I was extremely disappointed in the Mac version of Quiken because it was much less sophisticated than the Windows version and the majority of my Banks and investment accounts did not allow for downloading or internet access with the Mac product.</review>

<review id="8416">You can't boot off of this device - and that's not anywhere in the specs.  Still trying using the workarounds on the net.

<review id="8417">This review is from: Wall-E (Two-Disc and BD Live) [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)      Nowhere near as good as 'Finding Nemo' or 'The Incredibles'. There's the usual dazzling PIXAR animation, but little else. Utterly forgettable.</review>

<review id="8418">Sorry, but this gate is not fully adjustable, and it is not easy to install.  If you can deal with the frustrating locking/unlocking mechanism, then it might be OK - but only if your space is slightly larger than the size of the gate or the gate + extension.  This gate bridges the gaps with the metal gate/extension part, but reaches the walls with tension bolts.  Unfortunately, the further you have to unscrew the tension bolts, the harder it is to install.  So if your opening is slightly more than 28", 33", 38" or 43" (the size of the gate + various extension pieces), you may be in luck.  But if, like me, you have openings that are 37.5" and 42.5", these things will not work at all; by the time you have the gate square and ready to lock, the tension bolts will reach their ends and pop out of the gate.However, even using it just for fun in a 34" opening, I couldn't get the gate to latch or unlatch properly.  The instructions say that if it is hard to open, then you have tightened the tension knobs too tightly.  But if you don't tighten them that tightly, the gate just swings open at a feather's touch - not very safe or useful as a gate.  In my frustrated-beyond-belief opinion, this product is worthless.</review>

<review id="8419">My manual cuff broke, went hi-tek and bought this; worked okay 6 months, then it started giving lower readings.  Recorded daily several times for 2 weeks.  Called doctor, she said take half-dose high b.p. meds.  Then I took none a week later, since readings were still low.  Mistake.  It doesn't give accurate readings anymore.  Tried everything in the manual.  Wasted my money.  Going back to manual, if I can find one, with one-sided stethoscope (you can hear better).</review>

<review id="8421">I cant be double faced when i write down this review as 2 stars.I must admit...Afterall This is my second Purchase. Hence my second ACER ONE.I fell in love with my first White ACER ONE right off the box. Everything was working great.My 1st acer one specs...White, win xp, 160 hd, 1gig ram.Unfortunately...my second purchase of acer one...Pink, win xp, 160hd, 1gig ram is a different story.I noticed that the internal mic wasn't working.  I tried to download the audio driver installed it...MIC WORKED!BUT whenever I restart the unit or logoff the pc...the internal MIC doesnt work.IVE TRIED UNINSTALLING THE DRIVER THEN REINSTALL...Same result...worked but dont restart otherwise it wont.  Ive been googling the net to find out i have a few people with the exact issue. some however are worst.FORTUNATELY...using an external microphone through the available mic in slot works.My assessment on this Internal mic problem is probably a software driver issue and NOT a hardware problem simply because the internal mic works when you install the driver...and when it does work it works really well.  but what do i really know.The only thing i can think of that is different with my 1st acer one was the bios.The first ACER ONE I have has the bios version .3301 while the pink one has the .3305 version.And I dont want to change bios just to find out...I rather wait for someone with the same experience who knows the solution send me a guide to fix this issue.Returning this pink acer is troublesome for me...and is somehow a waste of time and effort...For now i am awaiting acer to provide a fix for this issue which seems to me that a number of people are having.With this ...The unit is still a worthy buy.  Just hoped acer fixes issues on items they sell.</review>

<review id="8422">Such high hopes for this upgrade, but 2008 is for the most part a change of window dressing. We bought this  to be compatible with the occasional client who uses office, also for the email/scheduling system.PROS:Syncs with icalLove the My Day app that let's you see a snapshot of schedule and tasks and flagged emails pop into this list.Has had an immediate productivity boost.Improved GUI, less cheesey.Improved junk mail filtering.CONS:Fonts Loading: 20-50 seconds load time for each application in the suite. Then if you're using PowerPoint or Word clicking on the font list invokes a delay of up to 3 seconds. If you have a few fonts open and you're working on a document in PowerPoint doc it's a deal-breaker -- even turning off WYSIWYG font menu bears the same results unless you're rocking a Penryn. We're using keynote now.Microsoft tells you, you can "install it on up to three computers". What they don't tell you is it can only be running on one -- it sniffs the network to find other computers and will make you quit. This is very annoying if you have a tower and a laptop. PowerPoint Crashes  CONCLUSIONOverall I feel a bit duped by Microsoft -- new bells and whistles but feels like little effort has been put into overhauling the engine of this beast. If I were to do it again, I would buy ilife, but admit that I still use and prefer their email app. Entourage (mainly because of My Day).</review>

<review id="8423">1. Tech support knows nothing about this laptop. They actually hung up on me. 2. The laptop cannot drive a large screen 1680x1050 external monitor when running linux. If you install windows XP it works fine. You are stuck with the default linux options unless you have the time to spend hours reading linux discussion boards to maybe find your solution (i don't think the discussion boards have figured out the VGA out issue yet with the xandros OS). 3. The 40GB solid state drive is actually an 8GB solid state drive with another, seperate, 32GB slow flash memory. I am constantly having to reduce the size of my "C:" drive in windows to keep it under 8GB.I would buy the eee pc 1000HD with windows xp for $100 cheaper if I could do it over again.</review>

<review id="8424">This review is from: Religulous [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)      I am an Atheist, and people like Maher are the Atheist equivalent to Bill O'Reilly, it's that simple.

<review id="8427">I finished Breaking Dawn last night at 915pm and rather than feeling like I had closure, I felt unsettled and a bit confused. I am an avid reader and usually run though books the first time, but because I was so excited about the book (I have read the previous three books at least twice now and own two copies of the first two books as well as the special edition of Eclipse being the enormous fan I am) I decided to take my time with the book and really read to understand what was happening the first time.  I didn't rush my read in order to really appreciate and savor the story I knew she would present.At the end....I was so ill at ease I had to talk to my fianc閑 about it (Im 31) despite the fact that he has never even looked at the books.  I had to voice my unhappiness because I didn't feel ok when I finished it.Caution...some spoilers belowFirst of all...I read her article in EW and know she had to fight to get the last book done...that there was disagreement as to her even writing a 4th book.  They'd only wanted three books and Meyers knew it wouldn't be resolved well in a three book series.  So I have to say, I don't know if that particular compromise and the pressure of having to end the series in a 4th book is a big reason this book came out the way it did.I felt the book; at least the beginning told from Bella's pov could have been its own expanded book.  A lot of the events in her first book felt rushed and underdeveloped.  I'd have liked to have read more of her descriptions.  Generally she's very thorough and makes sure her readers know all that's happening in enough detail.  The beginning book felt hasty and unsettling because we weren't allowed to enjoy each moment.  It was rush to here...rush there...and then she's pregnant.I would not have cared she'd gotten pregnant accept for Ms. Meyer's descriptions of her vampires on other websites.  I think she stated they didn't have any body fluids of their own....that's why they have red or amber eyes when they feed for example.  If she'd mentioned the pregnancy angle when Bella was reading about the info she'd found online in the first book as unexpected foreshadowing for the 4th book, I think it would have been ok.  However, because the pregnancy angle had never been broached before in any of the books...had never even been a single thought in Bella's mind...good or bad....it felt really contrived.  I can't help but feel that the pregnancy thing should have been eluded to somewhere in the last 3 books in any way, even despite Meyer's online information, so it wouldn't have felt like a last minute addition that was a neat angle that made some kind of sense rather than was mind blowing in its appearance from left field.I was disappointed in how little it appeared Edward seemed to care about Renesmee (my name is Vanessa and I know how crappy in real life Nessie and the Loch Ness Monster thing is too by the way...but I had to prefer her nickname to the given name.  Her real name felt contrived too..especially since most of the names and nicknames Ms. Meyers  chose favorably for her characters in all the books were one or two syllables that easily flowed.) He didn't seem to care so much about the baby, even after her felt it's mind and love for Bella, until after Bella was deemed to be ok.  I felt he was disconnected from the baby for too long...and that's really unorthodox for Edward's literary character.  He's so passionate about everything Bella that it didn't make much sense that he'd give her over to other people to care for while waiting for Bella...especially when Nessie also was shown to not be a threat.  I thought Bella's concerns became Edwards priorities so I was saddened that Edward didn't seem to warm to the kid until after Bella, after she was all  better...after they realized she was in control and ok too as a newborn, did.  It didn't seem like him at all.The imprinting between Jacob and Nessie didn't bother me.  It had been approached in the other books and explained thoroughly as being platonic until reaching maturity.  I don't think it's fair to criticize Ms. Meyers in that regard.  I thought she did a good job with that.The overall conflict with the Volturi, however, and all the aspects of the preparation was what really bothered me the most though.Ms. Meyers has always set her fantasy characters in human terms.  All the characters felt grounded despite the fact that they were inhuman.  They were fragile, able to be hurt, and questioned their motives and abilities in comparison to humanity.  Id'd loved how she could take these super beings and show how flawed and human they were.  Id always thought that was her true magic...that sometimes, in order to do what was right and necessary...everyone had to sacrifice.The ending didn't feel like a sacrifice whatsoever.Edward, Jacob, and Bella, and Nessie's stories ended too conveniently.  Their actions leading to the battle felt correct and justified...but at the end...with the off between good and bad....the battle scene ended anticlimactically because there was no real battle.  No one had to fight to sacrifice what they believed in.  They just seemed to have a really big scare.  All those worries for nothing.     Bella got everything she wanted way too simply  (despite her graphic birthing and changing.) The end of the book could have been epic...the maturity of the last book with the ending could have been breathtaking....but unfortunately, at the very end, it was the first time I felt like I was really reading a book geared toward younger people.Id always loved how her first three books weren't classic "disneyfied" fairy tales.  They'd been real...like the fairytales of old, with choice and consequence, love and alliance, follow the herd or think outside the box to find a person's own truth.  I didn't feel ok with how this book ended.I couldn't believe this was supposed to be the last book (as the posters in the bookstores stated.)  I have looked over Meyer's interviews and EW to see if this book is suppose to be the last book period or just the last from Bella's pov only and what Midnight Sun's role is going to be in this series.  I can only hope Midnight Sun picks up and fills some of the gaps in this story and perhaps would bring a better sense of closure to the entire series.So sorry Ms. Meyers.</review>

<review id="8428">While the unibody is nice, the new aluminum Macbook isn't made well.  The battery cover is very loose (so is 2 of my friends), it dents and scratches easily with just a regular watch I had on and placed on a wooden table, and the screen/graphics while a little better than the previous Macbook, isn't a lot better.  It seems like Apple rushed this out and didn't take the time to build it with quality in mind.  I spent a great deal of money on this, but the previous Macbook 2.4 for the same amount of money has a lot more power in benchmark tests than this one.  It has no firewire power which is really stupid.  Even a $500 Dell has that.  The previous Macbook had it.  My friends already has 2 stains on his palm rest which will not come out.I can't recommend this computer to anyone and that is sad because I'm a big fan of Apple products and have 2 other computers by them.  I have a black Macbook and a iMac.  I'm returning this to Apple and will just use my black Macbook which is better in my opinion anyways.Apple quality has taken some strong hits lately.  They are devoted to building iPods and iPhones and have forgotten about their computer line.  Very disappointing.</review>

<review id="8431">I am just stunned at the staggeringly, unbelievably miserable write performance of this device, especially with the stellar reputation the first-gen OCZ Rally had.I just transferred 1GB of *large* video files (HD game trailers) to the stick.  Total time: 24 minutes.  24 minutes for 1GB of large files.  That works out to a beyond pathetic 700KB/second!  What on earth is wrong with this POS?Transferring small files is even worse... I have spent an entire afternoon filling this stick with a few thousand files.  Don't EVER copy a lot of small files to this, zip them up or something first to a single file.Delete performance is just as bad.  I have seen it take an entire minute to delete a couple of large files.  When I had to delete thousands of files, I literally gave up because it was taking forever (looked like it was going to take hours), and formatted the thing.It's like this thing's FAT (File Allocation Table) is horribly slow, and any changes to it take an unreasonably long time.Oh, as if the above wasn't bad enough, several times I have copied a huge file to this, and then found out later the file wasn't copied properly.  I was able to scan one of the non-working files using BitTorrent's hash checking (against a torrent of the same file), and guess what?  The first 1% of the (2.4 GB) file was corrupted or missing, which means ~24MB didn't get copied properly.  Brilliant.The *only* bright point with this stick is it truly does have amazing read speeds... approaching 30MB/sec.  But the ridiculously poor write performance makes this thing basically unusable for me in real-world use.  Perhaps if you write to this extremely infrequently and read all the time from it, it would be adequate.I have ordered an 8GB Corsair Voyager GT, and plan on destroying the Rally2 when it arrives.  It's that bad.</review>

<review id="8432">I reviewed lots of gates before I bought this one, and it seemed to be the highest quality for the price.  I like the fact that it's made of wood which matches our baby's room decor (the gate is on her doorway, as the stairs are right outside), and the vertical slats are great as she's a climber.  It was also very easy to install, now that the correct template is included.  HOWEVER, the first time my daughter tried to rattle the gate around the bottom rail slid right out of the wall support, and with a little pulling on her part there was a lot of room between the last slat and the door frame.  We've had to anchor the rail with a spring clamp -- very annoying.  I can't find the receipt or I'd bring the thing back, and I'd never buy another one.</review>

<review id="8434">I purchased this router to use with a pc laptop (wireless) and a Mac connected via ethernet to the router. The PC works great, but the Mac and the router will not communicate properly. I've spent several hours talking with some very nice Indian folks on the phone about this, but each time there was no resolution to the problem. I've given up trying to solve the problem and just plug the Mac directly into my cable modem, then unplug it and plug the router in when I need to use the laptop. Of course, that sort of defeats the purpose of the router!</review>

<review id="8435">I would be willing to bet everyone who likes this product has no knowledge of networking or bandwidth.  I only get 0.5 to 0.8 Mbits 15' away!  The bandwidth rating of 54Mbits is a complete lie.  Most of the time the system tray icon will say that you're getting 54Mbits.  Howevever, I'm an IT professional so I tested the bandwidth with networking tools which reveal only 0.5Mbits.  To make matters worse Lynksys tech support gave me the run arround and then hung up on me!</review>

<review id="8436">I was so excited to get this item for my dog cause he barks all the time but it did not work. It may have squirted him once while he had it on in two weeks.

<review id="8437">This movie really was just okay at best.  It feels like it would have made 2 decent episodes, but does not work that good as a movie.  Probably worth buying at about ten bucks imo since I doubt anyone could suffer through it more than twice.</review>

<review id="8438">It looks good on paper ,but thats as far as it goes.Controls are not user friendly,in fact they are confusing.The instructions are at a minamum.Using it is a chore.I tried to ,but gave up.

<review id="8439">When using the mixer it is not possible to scrape the sides of the bowl while it is mixing so you have to stop it every so often to clean the sides.  If you don't have the protector on the top and even sometimes when you do, it throws flour, etc., all over the place.  It is too heavy.I prefer the old two beater type which the bowl rotates while mixing.  I am disappointed in this product.</review>

<review id="8440">The Flip Mino HD is a fun little toy, but it has a couple limitations. You need a very steady hand as it has no jitter correction, the focus beyond a three foot radius is fuzzy at best, and forget about the zoom. You're going to have to give up certain features of larger more expensive cameras and these are the missing features that are most noticeable to me.I'm a little disappointed in it but I'm going to keep it because, it's a fun little video camera to have around, you can shove it in your pocket(it's smaller than an iPhone), it's plug and play so it's easy to use, and the picture is decent enough. Just be advised for only another hundred bucks or so you can have a larger DV camera with more features. Know your limitations, if price is your concern you have other options, if you just want a toy to mess with,it's expensive but fun.</review>

<review id="8441">This unit is supposed to simple to use. It is until you try and view the files on your computer. After hooking it up with the supplied USB cord my computer locked up. After a reboot I was able to open the files only to recieve an error message. Reboot again, only this time a windows message saying the USB mass storage device was not working properly. In other words just one problem after another. After doing some research on line I found out that there are thousands of other people who have had the same problems with trying to open the files on their computers.There is nothing worse than hardware/software that advertises itself as being simple and straight forward to use but in the end involves having to jump through all kinds of hoops to get it to work. To me its really simple, it works or it does not. I should not have to do a bunch of complicated reconfiguration of my computer, or have to Google a handful of "error" messages or wade through a ton of user group discussion blogs to try and get the #$@^ thing to work right out of the box!Bottom line is that this thing has bugs big time! I'm taking mine back for a refund!</review>

<review id="8442">I bought this pet fountain because I wanted my cats to have a fresh, filtered & flowing water source available to them at all times.  This fountain DOES NOT provide that.  It does not filter out anything.  The intake accumulates cat hair and it just sits on the intake...it doesn't get filtered out.  Cleaning the fountain is very time consuming, and once a week is not enough if you want the water to stay clean.  The plastic was stained and rough almost immediately.  I kept this fountain for about 3 months, and decided to just throw it away one day when I was tired of trying to get it clean.  The design of it makes it very difficult to get all the nooks and crannies clean.  Even with the brushes that they recommend you clean it with!  Overall, I would say DON"T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!  Your cats will have a cleaner source of water if you just use a bowl and wash it out when you refill it.</review>

<review id="8443">Only works for about 2 months and them stops working, first I tought it was the battery, but I was not.

<review id="8444">This is the noisiest pet fountain I have owned. I have followed the directions very carefully and still, the noise is very unacceptable.  And now in order to return it, I have to pay shipping and restocking fees!!

<review id="8445">The so-called ComFit cuff is anything but. It doesn't taper. So if your arm is a little fatter at the bicep and narrower at the inside of the elbow where the reading is done, the device errors out unless you wrap it very snuggly. But when you do that, it compresses your arm so much as it fills with air that we actually found it very painful to use, with our arms and hands turning blood red from the compression. We tried cutting the plastic insert to relieve some of the pressure and managed only to break the device. It now errors all the time, and of course we can't return it given that we cut it. May try getting a replacement cuff and will see of Omron makes one that tapers. In general, though, I would stay away from this product unless you have a perfectly cylindrical arm.</review>

<review id="8446">Do not buy this pad. I had the same issue the other person wrote.. The left analog stick goes crazy after 15 minutes of playing.  The Wingman Action pad also had this problem.

<review id="8447">software compatability is great but this product does not seem to have the ability to stand up to any sort of use.  I was going through helicopter flight school at the time i bought these so i was fully aware of how to use pedals in helicopter applications. I found that if i went with more than 2/3 left pedal it would get stuck at the 2/3 level and then full left pedal application caused it to get stuck at full left. I pulled it apart to figure out what is going on and it appears that it is just a problem with the manufacturing.  I kept the left base a bit more loose than the manufacturer did and it seems to help alleviate the problem but i do have a problem with it from time to time.  My recommendation is dont buy this online unless you check the company to see if you can return a defective product free of charge.</review>

<review id="8451">This product is Outlook with an add-on of "Business Contacts".  They are not well integrated, but more importantly they don't really let you track sales opportunities, contacts, and the usual array of sales relationships in anything like an intuitive way.  Do it the MS way or forget it.  On my computer it runs SLOW- I have an IBM x60S, a solid XP machine, but it is such bloatware that it slows the whole machine to a crawl.  Overall, best to try something else.  I certainly will.</review>

<review id="8452">Bottom line... stick to electric. This product takes much longer than an electric trimmer. I thought it would be great after reading all the positive reviews, so I bought it. Looks like there's a forum about this product saying that many of these "positive reviews" are not legitimate. After doing a little research online, it sure seems that way. When a reviewer goes on an "opinion" website and reviews one or two items on a particular day and then never reviews anything again... it's kinda fishy. I found several "reviews" like that about this product. Anyway, as it turns out, this trimmer seems to be more of a hassle than anything else. I'll concede that it does seem well built; however, I'm definitely going to buy an electric trimmer.</review>

<review id="8453">The program crashes ALL the time.  But what is worse, just after you have trained it, and it starts to work well, it crashes.  Then you start all over again.  I've tried to reinstall my user files, but that doesn't seem to work.  So like Sisyphus you once again start at the beginning.  I could put up with the crashes if the company had some support, but with this product you're on your own.  Sure there is some tech looks ups, but a flesh & bone person, No way unless you pay. Once you buy 10 don't expect any support or upgrades.  Like I said you on your own.</review>

<review id="8454">Buyer beware at Pure Digital I received from Amazon my (Flip Video Ultra Series Camcorder, 60 Minutes (Orange) on July 31st 2008 Initially all went well and the quality was great and no problems with software. however I noticed a problem getting the camera to start and stop, it continued to worsen and I decided to contact tech support on October 11th 2008. After several email exchanges I was given a RMA# but no offer to send a prepaid label, believing that as it was still in warranty, I paid $7.00 to ship UPS. Than on a web search regarding problems with this item I was amazed at the number of very negative responses to their customer service and did discover that some has been issued prepaid labels and when I challenged them about that was told that it was not their policy to pay shipping, however they would make an exception and attached a prepaid label (now was too late as I has already paid shipping and requested a refund which was denied) I requested was action was being taken on my start/stop problem and the only answer I got was that it was being returned to me. They were unable to save any of my video's (that was not an issue)So I urge you to consider well before you make a purchaseIf you ever need customer service, BE AWAREI am awaiting return to see if the problem has been fixedI did receive a refurbed item and thus far it has worked fine, however I did not get a refund on my shipping charges therefore I will not rate this item any differently</review>

<review id="8457">This bark collar did not work at all for my 20lb Westie.  They made it too wide at the probe area and the plastic too rigid so it does not drape naturally around the neck of the dog.  I could not imagine this being used for any dog under around 40lbs.  Also it shocked her when I was letting her out back and she hadn't barked.  She took that to mean she shouldn't go out because she scrambled to get back in the door and would not go out again.  I had to carry her out and even then she kept running back to the door.  Finally after much soothing and coaxing she did her business.I do not know if this happened because the collar did not fit securely around her neck or if it has a defect, but I don't feel comfortable using something I can't depend on working properly at all times when it involves inflicting pain on my dog for no reason.  They instruct you to be able to fit your finger behind the probes but this left enough looseness that when my dog would shake her head the unit would turn so that the head was no longer at her neck which is the proper placement for it.</review>

<review id="8458">It was hard to decide on a rating.  The Nano is, in general, a great product, but I'm rating it here against the 3G Nano, which I consider better for music.  If you want to watch videos, then of course the 4G is better.  And the new glass cover for the screen is a big improvement.  That said....First, the shuffle function is horrible.  It shuffles really badly, *much* less randomly than my 2G or 3G Nano.  Even worse, if you plug it in to recharge, it resets the shuffle.  On the 2G/3G, if you turned on the hold switch it would not reset the shuffle and you could just continue from where you were, even in the middle of a song.  This is a real issue for me because I like to shuffle the songs, then work through the entire playlist without any repeats.  With the new shuffle, I have to constantly skip songs I've recently heard.I knew you could turn off the accelerometer, so I assumed that would turn it completely off, but it still remains operative for the cover flow.  This means if the Nano is tilted in your pocket you can't just reach in and adjust the volume.  You have make sure it's standing straight up or all you do is scroll through the covers.  It's a major hassle.  And the cover flow "feature" doesn't work very well, anyway.The battery life is noticeably shorter than my old 2G/3G Nanos.  Like others in the reviews, I'm going back to my 3G.  I sold it to a friend and I'm just going to offer to swap.  That should make him happy.  Although once I warn him about the problems he might not want to swap....</review>

<review id="8460">Description does not include important fact that this is not Mac compatible. Once used, it cannot be formatted except on a PC.

<review id="8461">This review is from: Madagascar - Escape 2 Africa (Full Screen) (DVD)      This movie, while entertaining, has a racist theme. The phrase "cracker lackin" is uttered again and again. Can you imagine the contoversy, if this were an equivilent racial slur against black, or any non-white race of people? I suppose that "cracker lackin" means "a place without white people," because of the context that it is used in. Because of its repeated use, I have deducted two stars. I deducted one more because the movie was not as entertaining as the original.</review>

<review id="8462">We bought this product for our 7 month old puppy who barks like crazy in his cage once left alone.  This product only sprayed about once every 30+ barks for our dog, so it didn't spray enough for him to associate barking with getting sprayed.  Also, please note that since this product comes with a  liquid (the spray), it is non-returnable through Amazon.  Perhaps our dog just has a certain bark that doesn't trigger the thing, but a device we have since bought which emits a sonic sound (dog whistle like) works every time and has been very effective.</review>

<review id="8463">This review is from: The Princess Bride (Special Edition) (DVD)      Rob Reiner's "The Princess Bride" is a love letter to the art of storytelling.  It celebrates the limitless boundaries of a child's imagination and the power of the fairy-tale to captivate.  Yet, Reiner's film is too disjointed and cartoonish to be considered a true success.  A grandfather (Peter Falk) visits his sick grandson (Fred Savage) and treats him to a story.  The story revolves around a peasant girl named Buttercup (Robin Wright) who mistakenly believes her beloved Westley (Cary Elwes) has perished.  Doing her best to get on with her life, she soon catches the eye of Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) who seeks her hand in marriage.  Yet, unbeknownst to Buttercup, she is actually to become a pawn in a sinister plan hatched by the monarch.  Fortunately, the day is saved when the Dread Pirate Roberts overcomes a series of challenges to rescue Buttercup.The most positive aspect of "The Princess Bride" is the exact same thing responsible for all of its problems.  The film is essentially a live-action children's book and Reiner succeeds admirably in bringing to life the grandfather's fairy-tale.  However, "The Princess Bride" has an uneven feel to it because it has replicated the format of a book too well.  All of the major encounters and conflicts feel like individual chapters which undermines the narrative coherency of the film.  In addition, all of the characters are basically stock figures and devoid of emotional depth.  They come across as simple players in a child's adventure and are all the more boring because of this.  "The Princess Bride" admittedly has a sense of charm about it but all of its colorful parts do not coalesce into a noteworthy whole.</review>

<review id="8466">The coffee maker looks nice and incorporates some good features, but has two drawbacks, in my opinion. First, since the opening for the water reservoir is right behind the top of the filter basket you need to be careful not to let the water splash into the coffee filter.Second, the machine is aluminum on the outside with a black plastic liner, and there is no water level indicator on the outside. You are supposed to lean over the machine (hard to do if it is under a cabinet) and look down at the water reservoir and gauge the water level against a grey plastic graduated stick against the black plastic sides. I realize you could just measure the water you pour in to begin with, but that is an extra step if, like me, you use a water filter such as Pur or Brita.In summary, it's a nice machine, but the water reservoir should be separated from the coffee filter, and there should be an external water level indicator.</review>

<review id="8467">This review is from: Transporter 3 [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)      Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a transporter forced into doing a job he doesn't want. It involves delivering Valentina, the kidnapped daughter (Natalya Rudakova) of a politician, to Odessa. His employer is the villainous Mr Johnson (Robert Knepper), who is being paid to have the countryside of Ukraine opened to toxic waste pollution. If the plot sounds ridiculous well it's implementation is even worse, as Martin fights off one gang of bad guys after another in a series of absurd and very boring martial art sequences. This flick resembles a video game more than a high quality action movie like the "Bank Job". Martin is like a super hero without any special powers or a low rent (very low rent) James Bond. It's all completely predictable and boring, even the sex scene with Martin and the annoying Valentina is lame. Obviously, this clunker is not worth the time or money.</review>

<review id="8470">The new Macbook looks great, and it's sturdy all-aluminum unibody design is awesome!So buy this computer if you don't plan to use it for work but only as a piece of high-tech decoration, or for showing off with friends. Two points make it absolutely unusable:The screen isn't only a glossy screen: its a hyper-ultra-mega-glossy screen, since a glass plate is mounted on top of the glossy screen. It's almost impossible to not be distracted by reflections when working with it, which causes eye-strain, fatigue, and maybe more serious ocular problems. Now, if you want to do your make-up or shave while working, this computer might be a good choice.Then of course, this computer is unusable for anybody making serious audio or video, or event just wants to use multiple speedy harddisks. Not only would that person have to sell all his Firewire equipment and by their USB2 equivalents (when they actually exist), he also would have to settle for far inferior technology, and suffer all the problems that come with the USB port versus Firewire: glitches, bottlenecks, asynchronicity, CPU strain etc. etc.Think twice before buying this computer: you may not use Firewire now, but will need it soon. You may not notice the glare and reflections of the glossy screen now, but you will feell the headaches and fatigue constantly having to reajust your vision sooner or later.Conclusion: a seductive but deceptive object, good to show off but not for work.</review>

<review id="8471">After looking over reviews from other customers, I noticed a trend in what they were saying but failed to listen. Most of the reviews are pre-2008 and were from 2006.

Not for me. The reason I purchased the product was to have the mobility to move about my home freely without being tied down in front of my computer screen.

<review id="8474">It only actually activated maybe twice, despite days of trying the collar and hundreds of barks. We tried a fresh battery, too.

The sensor on this one didn't work for our dog.</review>

<review id="8475">I bought this router to replace my Belkin-G router.  Just wanted something faster. The reviews were great all over the net. The features sound fantastic but none of that matters if you can't get the darn thing to work. I am not a techie. I want to plug and go. I can follow the installation instructions given by most install wizards. If I have to go to the manual to install, that's a red flag for me. I could not get this router to recognize my SBC dsl connection for anything. My belkin ( and previously netgear) routers recognize my SBC internet just fine. No fuss or muss. I am sure with tweaking and futzing this thing would have worked.  Tech support wanted me to turn off firewall, check DNS IP and download updates.  Way too much involvement for me. I'll go look for a netgear or belkin N-router.</review>

<review id="8476">As many other reviewers have noted, I have been a TT fan and user for the past 10 years.  Over the past three, however, I noticed a serious deterioration in the product along with increasing prices.  However, this year's outrageous hidden charges and forced upgrades along with an ever increasing retail price have combined to make this my FINAL year with TT. I also have had a lot of trouble loading this product on to my computer. But worst of all are the mistakes.  I am still paying the State of MASS back taxes because of an ongoing gross error in the software. This year it told me my pension income was not taxable when it clearly IS.  I cannot trust this software any longer to do my taxes.I have tried writing to Intuit in the past and found them the most uncaring company I have ever dealt with.  They could care less if you stay or go as a customer.  So I finally have decided to take the 'go' option.  I will take the advice of many others in this forum and switch to Tax Cut.</review>

The First Years company has indicated we need to replace the foot pedal but is not broken, just easy to pull up and remove.  We had no idea it was that easy until he did it.  As grandparents who want to keep a toddler out of non-childproof areas, this product did not work for us and we would not recommend it to others.</review>

<review id="8479">The Premier version as marketed by Intuit and sold by Amazon is still overpriced. Since the Deluxe version does not support preparation of Schedule D, this means you will pay $30 more just to have the capability to prepare this form. Premier ($74) minus Deluxe ($45)= approx. $30..Amazon initially offered the Deluxe version at about $59, and is now selling it for around $45!  About the same as TaxCut. I guess the Intuit product wasn't flying off the shelves.  Amazon, it's about time to lower the Premier version $20 or so.  It appears your other sellers have no problem with the $50 price range!</review>

<review id="8480">I use a Dremel tool with a grinding drum on my dogs nails.   You can vary the speed, there is no guard to obscure your view, and the dremel does an excellent job.   My dog takes a nap while I do his nails.   He didn't like it at first, but got used to it, and now it's a snap to do his nails.   We keep them short, he walks without clicking, and his paws look very pretty!</review>

<review id="8481">How can I put this sensitively?The new "Transformers" movie is going to be a collassal waste of time, money, ambition and expectations. Of course the idea of the Transformers lends itself to being a great summer film, but the execution of what I have seen so far is insipid.The robots look nothing like they are supposed to, the look of this film is more "War of the Worlds" (2006) mates with "Bad Boys 2" than Hasbro 1984, and once again Hollywood brings in annoying humans to be the center of attention, since a 2 hr film starring only the Transformers (the things we have actually paid money to see) would be too expensive to make. This way the animators do not have to perform anymore than what is expected of them, instead of being inspired to painstakingly create a real live action film of a beloved cartoon and toy series.Every inch of film I have witnessed so far makes me gag and anyone who is truly excited about this film needs to check their expectations at the door. You are about to be as sorely disappointed as you were when you first saw "Spiderman 3," and "Superman Returns."Now lets bow our heads in a moment of silence...</review>

<review id="8482">This review is from: Let The Right One In (DVD)      I saw this film purely on great buzz. It made many 'top 10' lists in 2008 and I was curious about this film that I'd never heard of. I never saw a trailer and all I had to go on was a couple of wonderful reviews and a small blurb of a synopsis.I am very open-minded when it comes to film. I love the horror genre as well as anything to do with vampires. And I usually like foreign horror. But I admit I was entirely dissapointed in Let The Right One In. It starts out promising but after that I felt nothing for the film, nor its characters.This is not a horror film and should not be labeled as such. I'm not even talking about shock and gore. I'm talking about atmosphere. It was lacking. There was no sense of foreboding, no real mystery, nothing that made your spine tingle. Yes, it is a romance of sorts and while it may be interesting in that regard, it still felt lacking. The main problem is that there is no backstory to the character of Eli. She is a vampire and she is 12 and has been for quite a while. That's all we know. I did some research after the film and found out from people that read the actual book what exactly happens to her. Her backstory sounded more heartbreaking than this entire film.Without it, Eli was just a mysterious little vampire with an ambiguous past. The acting was pretty good and I thought the actors who portrayed Eli and the bullied Oskar did a great job in that regard. When Eli very briefly reveals something pretty darn important about her past, it is not questioned by Oskar for even a second. Not even the fact that she is a vampire deters him or makes him blink. Some would call that sweet and romantic. I would call it unrealstic in any case. I appreciate what the director was trying to accomplish, and maybe the actual book is very good, but as a movie, it feels very lacking and the ending leaves much to be desired. I swear Oskar's fate will be just like Eli's other caretaker/father/whatever he was supposed to be. And that is hardly what I would call a love story.</review>

<review id="8483">As a frequent network user, I have set up four different brands of WiFi routers on a dozen platforms (various ISPs using DSL, cable, corporate networks, even dial-up) in four states and two countries (US and Korea).  I have never seen an install wizard as completely useless as this one.  I followed the directions, used the set-up CD and followed its steps one-by-one.  It was very simply with idiot-proof diagrams throughout.  However, at the very end of the process I chose the manual set-up in order to disable the security to have an "open" network.  Everything looked really straight forward until an error message popped up during the very final step saying that my settings had failed.  There was no way to proceed that didn't generate the same error and my network was not working at all.  So I called tech support.  I spoke with tech support (who had a very heavy foreign accent and was difficult to understand) for 30 minutes.  After determining that I knew how to plug everything in properly, they gave me the device's IP address so I could configure it manually and walked me through that.  It turned out to have already taken most of my settings, despite the error messages.  However, the wireless still did not work properly.  I could see the wireless network from my laptop's network window, but the network name had been mangled (several letters were incorrect) and I could not connect to it.  After many attempts to fix this, including updating the firmware from Linksys's website, refreshing the factory settings and following the Easy Set-up again, it still did not work properly.  I plan to return this Linksys WRT54G WiFi router immediately and continue to use by SMC Barricade WiFi router (which is also somewhat disappointing in performance, but at least functions).  Maybe I'll go buy an Apple WiFi box instead.  The first two WiFi routers I owned were Linksys and those worked well for many years (one still does).  It's a shame that Linksys's quality and tech support have deteriorated so much under Cisco.</review>

<review id="8484">Having read the reviews citing the problem with the flimsy, easy to break coffee bean container I was VERY VERY careful to make sure it was inserted correctly.  And I was successful, for a time; it did not break until one of the grinders (the upper one that is supposed to be removeable) got stuck.  As in it wouldn't grind the beans and wouldn't come out.  I spent probably thirty minutes trying to unjam the grinder.  At some point during that endevour the bean holder got chipped.  Given the broken bean container and stuck grinder, I returned the it.</review>

<review id="8485">I will say people who like this one are Apple lovers or have simple brains.    This one is durable and has long lasting battery, but all you can do is listening the musci from the beggining to the end. That's it.  I forgot, you can stop and pause music too.  If you think this is good because of low price, then YP U3 might be better.</review>

<review id="8486">I really wanted to like the 1000HA - for all the positive reasons expressed in the reviews.  I had three units with all the same problems, so I finally gave up on the 1000HA and bought the Samsung NC10 (which I have now had for two weeks or so - home run with the first unit).I had two main problems with the 1000HA:  speakers crackled and the housing around the battery quickly loosened up so that too much play developed around the battery.  Mind you, I experienced these problems with three different units.If these kinds of issues don't bother you, the 1000HA is otherwise a great machine.  It does start up faster than my Samsung NC10 (even after I upgraded the memory on the Samsung).</review>

<review id="8487">I purchased an older model, new from Petsafe and it requires CR 2032 batteries. It is very inefficient. They put small batteries in the collar that require them to be changed often. A cost of $4.50 to change the batteries every few weeks makes the PetSafe collars far too expensive to operate. They should have put rechargeable AA or AAA batteries in the collar instead. I will never buy one again. Now, it's time to buy again and it looks like they are still using batteries that are too small.</review>

<review id="8488">I was very disappointed that one port was defective right out of the box.  Troubleshooting this problem cost us several hours as we tried to track down cable, switch, computer and other issues at the same time.  In the end we needed to leave the unit limping along with one lost port while I went to the store to get a replacement.  Historically Lynksys was a good manufacturer -- but this is causing me to reconsider ever using their products again.  This problem cost us a lot of money (time plus a second visit that the customer won't pay for because I wouldn't ask them to compensate me for troubleshooting a bad switch that I provided) and the customer was down for a lot longer than we originally estimated.</review>

Stay away until Intuit fixes the issues and per their support forums, fixing it will not be trivial.</review>

<review id="8491">I am very disappointed with this product. Have been having problems from early on, virtually since buying it. Their customer support tends to blame everything else (the operation system, the internet provider, existing firewalls, etc) and just created additional problems with unhelpful recommendations. ultimately, 5 months after expiration of the 1 year warranty, after acknowledging that yes, the router "went bad" (these were their exact words) they just advised me that they could not replace it. so, basically this is a somewhat problematic router for those of you who don't need it for more than a year. as for me, I'm switching to Netgear. Today.</review>

<review id="8492">I purchased this model in 2006 after having a refurbished model that lasted only three years.  Needless to say, I expected a long life time purchasing a NEW Kitchen Aid Professional Stand Mixer.  I bake bread frequently and own most of the original accessories that are made of metal rather than inexpensive plastic.  I am sorry to report that over the course of this past weekend, while creaming butter and sugar together the mixer froze up.  After writing to Kitchen Aid and then reading the discussion boards on Amazon, I opened the cover yesterday to find that I owned a mixer with a plastic gear box.  I am a materials chemist and I understand very well the difference between the performance of plastic and metal.  Essentially what has happened to my mixer is that over past years of making various types of breads, the plastic gear box cover has become deformed enough to not be able to keep the correct amount of pressure on the gears.  One slight disturbance and the mixer gears will not mesh and the mixer freezes up.  I called Kitchen Aid today as I feel I have paid top dollar for a substandard product.  Kitchen Aid apparently had switched to an aluminum gear box recently to avoid the issues with those mixers made with plastic gear boxes.  The only offer the customer service manager would offer me was to send me a shipping kit free of charge and have the mixer looked at Kitchen Aid's site.  I would be responsible for all repairs.  I am outraged that after paying top dollar, that this is the best that Kitchen Aid can offer to a loyal customer.It is rather interesting to note that the newer King Arthur Flour Cookbooks and their catalog no longer recommend or sell the Kitchen Aid Mixer.  I think in the near future I will going on the recommendation of the King Arthur Flour Company's catalog and purchasing a Viking(1000watt) stand mixer.  On a somewhat related note, we recently had to replace a three year old top of the line Kennmore Calypso washing machine that was made by Whirlpool.  After getting no where with Sears, I can faithfully say that I am done buying ANY product manufactured by Whirlpool (who now owns Kitchen Aid)!</review>

<review id="8493">The movie itself is great. This blu-ray disk is not so great. While watching the movie, the aspect ratio of the film changes. It will show regular widescreen for one scene or part of a scene with the black borders on the top and bottom. Then it changes to the imax aspect ratio which encompasses the whole screen filling in the black areas of the widescreen aspect. It does this throughout the movie. Changing back and forth. To the people and critics that say this is not noticeable; they are wrong. It is very noticeable and annoying. Once I started to notice, during the bank heist scene, I thought there was something wrong with my TV. It's the blu-ray movie itself. Skip this disk and get the regular dvd.</review>

<review id="8494">I cannot believe the hype surrounding this series of books. I had high hopes, which were dashed primarily by the fact that SM used the same 10 adjectives repeatedly to describe each of her central characters. I love this genre and am so disappointed.

<review id="8495">I've owned this product for about 3 months now. I thought that the concept was excellent - a single appliance to do the job of 2-3 appliances. That would be convenient. By the way, 'Back to Basics' and 'West Bend' are the same item.I have not experienced the teflon problem that others describe, but this is a later review, maybe it has been improved. My first impression 'out of the box' was that it was very light - read that as cheap. Ok, I put that idea aside and tried it out.  I went ahead and used it over and over for several months and this is my impression:The egg poacher works well. It is like a drip coffee maker, the length of time that it cooks is determined by the amount of water you put in it. When the water is gone, the cooking stops. Unless you like rock hard eggs, do not follow the instructions, decrease the amount of water by at least one third. The meat warming tray - well, that just means putting a piece of meat in the poacher so that it gets steamed to warm. Sure, it drips on the egg, but no big deal. The toaster (to me, the heart of the machine) is the real weak point. It's more of a bread dryer. It toasts unevenly on each side and unevenly (lines) on a single side. Used as a toaster alone, I would rate it as poor.Conclusion: It works ok for a sandwich, better than fast food, and it is convenient and inexpensive. But if you have the budget, wait for the quality models to come out (I see that there is already one listed on Amazon). As soon as that new model is available, this thing goes to Goodwill. As I said.. I think the concept is great, but there needs to be quality too, which is absent in this product.</review>

<review id="8496">It's almost useless to rally against this movie, but its rather gross in its portrayal of obese people.  It also incorrectly links obese people to environmental problems.  As was displayed by many newspapers, it is not fat people who pollute, but thin and wealthy people.  Most overweight people are middle class, with the majority of poverty level being overweight.  These people create the least amount of waste in our society.  They own less cars, less property, less stuff and pollute less.Children are unable to understand such nuance and will think be given the message that fat people are to blame for what is the fault of all humanity.If Disney wanted to make a social commentary, they should have created a movie about an overweight family living below the poverty line whose overweight because the only food affordable to them is low nutrition, high fat, chemically packed food.  It would have at least been a social commentary on a problem that's actually real.</review>

<review id="8498">Considering I am a huge fan of Disney Pixar movies (Nemo being my all time favorite, with Bugs Life coming in a strong second) I was extremely disappointed with this film.  However, I did find Walle to be cute and I liked the interraction with him and Eve.  But then, it struck me as too preachy.  Humans are now so lazy they have lost the ability to walk, drink food from cups, and have no interraction with eachother, living on a ship in space because they have ruined Earth with too much trash.  Save me the lefty liberal BS and ENTERTAIN ME, please!!!!</review>

<review id="8499">I use this for storing and burning operating system images in a professional IT environment. Was very satisfied with it (size, capacity) till I had the misfortune of working with another IT pro who had a Western Digital Passport drive (My Essentials). Absolutely, no comparison in terms of performance. His drive: 4 min for a 3 gig transfer (burn); my drive: 12 min. These tests were head to head: each burning an image onto identical Dell 3400 workstations (14 times). Strangely, when I downloaded a disk testing utility, I found seek times between the two were virtually identical.  My conclusion is that the Mini's drives are fine but something is wrong with SimpleTech's implementation of USB 2.0. Nothing else would explain the disparity in large file transfers. The SimpleTech looks cool but I'm looking forward to the performance of the Passport I just ordered.</review>

<review id="8500">This router needs to be reset (unplugged then plugged in) almost every other day.  All of my computers will recognize the router but for some reason the connection is lost every now and then.  A reset takes care of it every time.  But that's annoying enough for me to rate this product one star.  Other than that, it works but definitely not the way it should.</review>

<review id="8501">I purchased an 8 GB shiny pink Nano from Amazon. I was so excited to see that the Nano returned to the design style I like, longer and sleeker.  I followed the instructions to power the Nano and attempted to sync it with iTunes. Everything worked flawlessly, as I expected. That was until I disconnected the Nano from the USB cable and touched a button. Suddenly the screen lock came on and I could do nothing. I mean, nothing.  I thought perhaps I made a mistake and so I tried it again...and again...and again...and again...again and again and again.I searched the Internet to see if anyone else had this problem. Low and behold some people did. Some were able to fix it by simply resetting the Nano to it's factory setting, which I tried again x 5. I really didn't want to send the Nano back because I thought, it has to be something I'm doing, Apple products generally work very well.No, it's not something I was doing. It is an annoying glitch that Apple needs to fix. The screen lock capability is a very nice feature, but not when it defaults automatically without any type of reset. So I returned it and got my money back. Then I found a Samsung P2 touch at a pawn shop for $50. Sleek, red and it totally rocks. So my Nano experience is over and my Samsung experience has begun.</review>

<review id="8502">It's adequate tax software, nothing special.  To really get my attention, and to keep me buying the software now that I've had a couple of years with the same living situation, vendors are going to need to start either including the whole e-Filing fee in the cost of the software or at least providing a substantial discount.The repeated updates needed over the course of the tax season are quite annoying, and this year's release still isn't handling my Massachusetts interest income quite the way it should.Intuit's slowness in releasing upgrades to its Quicken product for the Mac and the fact that they keep sending me e-mail promoting the Windows version made me have a negative response to this company's products in general.  TurboTax did nothing to improve my impression of them or retain me as a customer in the future.</review>

<review id="8504">After 19 years in the IT industry I thought I knew how to pick good software...  ACT! seemed safe enough; it's been around forever so they *must* have worked the bugs out, right?  Very professional packaging, sold everywhere, all the 'safety' signs are there...Well I was wrong.  Another review called ACT! 'snake oil' and I'd say that's pretty close to the mark.The first thing I noticed was that the quality of the printed reports (phone lists was my main interest) was horrible - actually horrible to the point of being illegible and unusable.  The marketing material rants about how you can print in collins-debden / filofax / etc formats though their wonderful templates but believe me, you'd be better off hiring a blind heroin addict to handwrite your address pages.  It would be both cheaper and more legible.Then there's the debacle over Windows Update - ACT is written so badly that when Windows Update did its thing, ACT had a hissy fit and self-destructed.  ACT took weeks to do anything about it, and I lost many frustrating hours diagnosing and fixing (by the way, I used to work inside ITG - the division of Microsoft Tech Support that gives tech support to Microsoft internal staff, so it's not like I'm a newbie at this stuff).(Also, by the way, the computer of interest is a brand-spanking new business-type Dell, with nothing on it but Windows XP, a good virus checker, and ACT.)Then after fixing that and using for a couple of weeks the crashing began... then more crashing, then the 100% cpu hanging, then the strange inability to select 'calender' - ever.  When I looked at the ACT! user forums the answer was clear - LOTS of users have LOTS of problems with ACT.  I was not alone in having problems or being frustrated and feeling cheated of time and money.  That's the big gripes, now the small ones.  The user interface is a joke - version 11?  What have they been doing between versions?  This looks like software did in the early 90's.  Then there's the slowness...  I just can't figure out why ACT is so slow...  this type of database should present no challenge of ANY kind to today's computers, contact management is the computer science equivelant of assembling brightly coloured alphabet building blocks to spell ' C A T '.ACT technical support staff are just blame-shifters.  While reading the forums I read all sorts of nonsense.  One support staffer told a customer 'I suspect your problem is that you have a 5400rpm hard drive' - this is CONTACT MANAGEMENT - Not magnetic resonance imaging of the centre of a neutron star!  At Microsoft I ran a two Gigabyte SQL Server customer database on 5400rpm drives with a pentium 400 at the helm - a long long time ago so ANY computer today should EAT a small contact database alive.  ACT like telling people they need supercomputers because the average joe doesn't realise just how simpe contact management is from an IT perspective and it gets the customer off the phone.  That was the worst of the cop-outs I heard, but there were LOTS of others.I've seen some bad code in my time, but I shudder to think what must be happening at ACT...  To have this many problems at version 11, to have performance issues running 1990's software on 2009 computers, to be so sloppy in coding that ACT doesn't work with Data Execute Prevention and Windows Update (two critical Microsoft security features) and with bad tech support to boot...This morning I uninstalled ACT and a sense of calm and happiness washed over me.  I also feel wiser, like the time I got mugged on a train on which I'd foolishly sat too far from the guards compartment at night.  This has been a lot like that experience actually, mildly expensive, fairly frustrating, and I won't make that mistake again.</review>

<review id="8505">I owned a Creative Fatal1ty 1010 for about six months and the left button stopped working (would not click anymore, unless it was in a good mood, which was rare).Creative sent me a supposedly brand-new Fatal1ty 2020 mouse, which I have had for around nine months, and now the left button has broken again, this time the opposite problem of holding down the "click" every time I click, meaning files I only wanted to select but not open are opened and whenever I close windows using the upper-right-hand corner "X" box, it closes all other windows behind it rapidly because the button is being held down (by the mouse).At this point, the warranty is up, and so is my patience.  From the looks of it, others seem to have had similar problems.  In case you're wondering, I use this mouse around one hour every day.  Save your $30, it isn't worth $3.</review>

<review id="8506">During the first few days of using Hydroxycut, I really liked the fat loss effect and it is true to its word.Then I experienced gathering acne on my face, and later, my neck. I confirmed this by doing research on Google, and there are a lot of discussion going on about Hydroxycut and acne (try Googling them). Unfortunately, I am one of the people that should not use Hydroxycut Hardcore. I am forced to stop taking Hydroxycut and proceed with my acne treatment. After 3 months from acne medication and NO Hydroxycut, severe acne has disappeared, with some acne scars. I have to continue acne medication for at least 3 more months to get rid of scars.My advice: Try a Smaller Bottle First. When you get no acne, then proceed getting the bigger bottles of it!</review>

<review id="8513">I've had no problems with reliability or anything like that, which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1.  The problem is that I use a Mac, and the U3 system is useless on Macs.  It is also not removable, even by reformatting the drive.  It's very annoying that when I plug it into a computer it automatically tries to pretend that there's a CD there, and Windows computers sometimes give pop-up messages about it.  I thought I could use this drive as a plain-old flash drive, but the fact that the U3 feature cannot be turned off or removed is an enormous pain.  I'm probably going to buy a different one, and I would recommend against buying this drive, at least until SanDisk makes it possible to remove the U3 system.</review>

<review id="8514">This USB flash drive may be cheap, but it is also very slow, especially for one so big. If you need to carry an incredible amount of data with you that you hardly ever access and almost never change, then this might be for you. But, for the average user, the manufacturer says: System Performance Read 10 MB/sec Write 2 MB/sec. This is very slow, compared to any modern high-performance drive. My OCZ Rally2 4GB has an impressive 23.8MB/s average read speeds, 14.8MB/s write speeds. The Corsair Flash Voyager GT is even faster at read speed of 33.8MB/s. So buyer beware!</review>

<review id="8516">Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)      I installed this product on my Windows Vista PC with high hopes. Those hopes were dashed against the rocks of reality over and over again.The product installed fine initially and seemed to be working as expected - my system was running just fine. Then I realized that there was no anti-spam protection installed by default. Anti spam features are something I have come to take for granted in any computer protection suite.After searching around I realized that there were anti-spam features available as a separate download. I installed the add on pack and then began trying to test Norton 360. I was immediately frustrated by a problem - there was no obvious way to adjust the level of aggressiveness on the anti spam filtering and no clear way to whitelist or blacklist improperly detected messages.I contacted "tech support." Norton 360 comes with one form of tech support - an online connection to a person in India. My particular representative was a) non-communicative and b) bored with the process. Not only was he unable to fix the issues I was complaining about but he was unwilling to explain what he was doing while he attempted to keep the anti-spam module from crashing anytime I tried it adjust the settings.After four hours of repeated installing, uninstalling and reinstalling of the product he gave up and I gave up on Norton 360 as a replacement for Kaspersky 7.0. Avoid Norton 360!</review>

<review id="8517">Never purchase this product. It lasted a good six months with only about ten times i had to reset it and sigh before it crashed the first time. After a thirty minute ordeal where I had to read the serial number no less then four times then get shafted to a supervisor - to get my IP Adress renewed! - only a few months later it goes down and bam, they say it's faulty and send it back.Well gee willikers, that'd be great if I still had my original reciept. Due to moving, I was unable to keep my hands on some of that stuff and it is lost. So, no repaired router for me. Customer service there sucks and the product makes me cringe. Stay away.</review>

<review id="8520">We purchased this blender thinking the quality would be higher than lower priced models.  While it seems good to detach the blade for cleaning, who really cares?  They are easy enough to clean, taking off the end is really just a nuisance.  We immediately notices that the switch seemed poorly designed and somewhat difficult to use.  It failed after a year of moderate use.  Even under warranty, it costs more in shipping and handling than getting another one, so that's what we're doing.  We had similar issues with a Kitchen Aid blender in the past.  They seem solid, but have weaknesses in some small but critical part that kills them, seemingly by design.  Then you have to decide if you want to go the trouble replacing the whole unit with another one that will fail early the same way.  Why would you replace a poorly designed appliance with the same thing?</review>

<review id="8522">I bought this router for my parents earlier this year and have had problems ever since. For whatever reason, it suffers from major connectivity problems - especially when you enable encryption. I frequently found myself on the phone giving tech support to my parents.

Go with D-Link, or alternatively Linksys, and avoid Netgear.</review>

<review id="8523">I had already read reviews when I picked up this book.  Regardless of the general early consensus that Breaking Dawn was a letdown; I actually thought I'd like it anyway.  After reading the newspaper and watching CNN, I, personally, was looking forward to a happy ending for once.I was not a fan of books 2 and 3 of this series; but I loved Twilight and The Host, so I have respect for Meyer and her imagination.  However, if I'm being honest, I don't believe that her ideas translated well onto paper in this one.  I was all for a happy ending, but the delivery took FOREVER.  BD dragged for me.  At the end of the series, I wanted to be happy for a finale with an odd sense of sadness that a story that touched me was over.  With BD, I could not wait til it finished.  Maybe if she had been able to deliver her material into a condensed version, I may have bumped this review to three stars.  There is maybe an entire page or so of a vamp we don't know named Garret giving a one-sided speech about the Volturi (uninterrupted) that made me yawn about 10 times.  He talked more than Alice did in this book.I'm glad Bella finally became a vampire, and got over Jacob.  I'm glad Jacob isn't miserable-- because although I personally would have preferred prevention of that weird relationship ever developing-- outside of his Bella obsession; he kinda slowly grew on me.  I actually liked what we saw of Bella's baby's personality; it was endearing, and I actually think I wouldn't mind trying Meyer's continuation of the series if Renesme was the narrator.On the other hand, I actually physically cringed when Edward referred to Jacob as "son."  That was just too much.  Just a day ago (or so), he had requested for his "son" to give his wife a son.....  somebody tell me you get how weird the switch from "oddly-likeable enemy-trying-to-steal-my-wife-and-kill-me" to "son"?????  I recall Meyer saying in an interview that she never really watched/read vampire stuff; so it was easy to break the rules.  I can respect that.  I can accept sparkly vampires.  But the way she explained this miracle baby coming around just read like a cop out.  It's one thing to break others' "vampire rules" but to break your own is a little disappointing.  Maybe she didn't exactly break her own rules; maybe I'm misinterpreting her recollections on vampires reproducing and dying--but I feel that she cut it a little too close; to the point that her explanations just weren't believable.  The name "Renesme"... I often don't think authors realize how much stock a reader puts into a character's name.   A name can make or break storylines (I've seen it happen with utterly ridiculous names in books).  I didn't care for it; but I don't think it was that big of a deal.  I totally hated "Nessie" though... if she is narrating the next set of books, I hope Meyer changes it to "Nessa" or something.  "Nessie" is annoying.   Unfortunately, there are a lot of other things that slowed this book down to a crawl for me--but I don't want to completely nitpick here.With that said, I knew about most of those spoilers before I read the book, and I was still really determined to like it.  Unfortunately, Meyer's saga ending didn't flow smoothly for me, it felt like bad turbulence with choppy surprises at every corner (the werewolves all of a sudden being shapeshifters last minute).  I understand that she had to tie up lose ends; but it felt like a very badly wrapped gift with an even worse present within.  Meyer said at the beginning that she wrote the books for herself.  They're her story; so I'm not one to tell her how to write it.  Unfortunately, BD just wasn't at the same level as Twilight had been, and instead of the series going out with a bang... it kinda just crumbled for me.Sidenote:  I understand that many people are upset with morals, and teen pregnancy.  Meyer never claimed to be an inspirational speaker or moral ethics professor.  She's just telling a fictional story and it needs to be kept in context.  Yes, Bella is a young teenager, who seems to have given up college--and is quintessentially barefoot, pregnant, and happy about it.  Maybe not the best moral setting for teens right?  Well, then I guess we should ban "The Little Mermaid"--who got married at 16 after knowing the guy for 3 days.  Take it all in context.  If we educate our kids, they tend to adhere the morals they are raised with better than the Cinderella story.  Review the book, not the author.</review>

<review id="8525">I'm an IT professional, and I couldn't get this router to work.  Nor could D-link tech support.  A frustrating experience.  I was setting up a very simple network - just a wireless laptop connection and a wired desktop using a cable modem.  The D-link didn't work wireless or wired.  Exchanged it for a Linksys, which took less than an hour to set up and it's working great.</review>

<review id="8526">I purchased a previous version of the My Book series and after having disk corruption twice it died completely after less than 2 years. All data lost. Has Western Digital improved its reliability in these newer drives? I doubt it, and I'm not willing to risk it. A positive review from someone who has only owned the drive a week isn't of much value. Read up on other review sites and discussion forums, there are tons of complaints about Western Digital's drives failing. If I were you I would shop other brands. An unreliable drive is not worth owning no matter what price you get it for.</review>

<review id="8527">I bought this because my Palm Pilot and new I Touch would not sync up with my older version of Outlook.  The good news: they both synched up!The bad news:  There is a slew of new menus to learn to do the simplest of Word, Excel, or Power Pt functions.  For example, the icon to open a file in Word or Excel is not displayed.  You can add it to a teeny menu if you like (took a while to find that).  Other menus are set.  For instance in "Home" menu mode, half the menu is taken up with "Style."  You can't get rid of it that I know of.  Then there was that heart stopping moment when I did get to the open screen and found none of my old Word documents there.  I had to select 1997-2003.  Phew.  Of course Word reminds me that I'm using that mode all the time.I guess my point is: Was there an effort to make this compatible in format and use for the average user or was this designed for professional keyboarders?Also, though I don't know if it's related, once "upgraded" to 2007, my Internet Explorer locks up constantly.  Could it be the constant Windows desktop search indexing?  Don't know.  Could just be a coincidence.  Maybe MS will work on the 100 error messages I've submitted over the past week.</review>

<review id="8533">Flip Video Ultra Series Camcorder, 60-Minutes (Black)High concept, low realization. File transfer errors occurred from camera to PC (XP SP2) and Mac (OS X.3.9) including I/O errors and CRC errors. Camera would not shut down (the LCD displayed the "connected" image) after following the "safe removal" usb device protocol. Took the camera back to BestBuy who didn't take my word for it, checked it, said it worked on their computer. Still didn't work for me on my three computers at home so took it back again along with a printout of all the same complaints noted here at Amazo--and with the connected screen still on-- and got my money back, eventually. I'll never shop at BestBuy again. Bought an RCA Small Wonder EZ201 from Circuit City. Not as chic as the Flip Ultra. But it WORKED, and was 50 dollars less! The support response at Pure Digital took about 24 hours but by then I had my money back. They wanted me to send it back to the factory (if I wanted to save the videos already on it) or reformat, download and install new firmware, etc. This for a product that is marketed as something for a technophobe. Ha. I'm comfortable with the technology, it's just that if it doesn't work out of the box, I don't want it.  Opportunity knocks but once.</review>

<review id="8535">Selecting foods by calorie total is a fool's errand.  No estimation of the healthfulness of the food in question is considered.  The author of this book appeared on a recent episode of the Biggest Loser and committed one of the most egregious nutrition errors possible. The contestant were shown some "pigs in blankets" along with a small bowl of nuts.  And the winner is...pigs in a blanket!  This head slapper comes from the fact that the pigs in blankets had less calories.  A cute little game of "gotcha" lacking intelligence.  No. No. No. No.  This is flat out the plain wrong approach to food choice.You ALWAYS go with the healthier option.  You are only as healthy as the food you eat.  If the feeble-minded out there must obsess over calories, then take out whatever number of nuts or other healthy food allows you to eat the healthier food.  Anyone who has any rudimentary knowledge of proper nutrition has probably forgotten more about good nutrition than this book will ever teach you.  All diet books need now is clever titles, packaging, and color photos.</review>

<review id="8536">One of the most painful experiences I have every had to load. Hours of frustration. Perhaps because I wanted to keep my 2003.  Finally did custom install with nearly all features turned off.  Boy that was not in the book.  I know it takes time to get use to something new, but things that should be right up front have became a game of hunt and peck or research. Some I have just given up on and went back to 2003.   Valueless or seldom used features clutter ribbon.   The whole layout/ribbon is nothing more than someone's opinion of what works best for them or what MS thought would show the best.  Frankly, I think thier opinion stinks.  I would rather have had a real user design the ribbons verses Marketing or a MS programmer.  Marketing at its finest and I bit.</review>

Not enough space for Linux, so they switch to another OS. This VxWorks OS so far has been very poor, lockups, intolerant of large file transfers, etc.</review>

<review id="8540">My Boxer francine was a rescued puppy I got in North Carolina where there was no Lyme Disease at the time.  I got excellent Flea & Mosquito Repellent results from a Natural product applied the same way as Frontline.  When i moved to Connecticut my Vet convinced me that because of Lyme Disease I needed to put Francine on Frontline Plus.  I noticed she was mildly comprimised  for a few days after each application but then back to normal.  After 6 months on the product she started having problems with not being able to food down but it would subside with human stomach meds, I did not make the connection that it was winter and cold and had stopped the Frontline.  She would be OK for a few months and the weather would warm up and I started the Frontline again and by winter she was sick again except worse than the year before. New doctors more tests IV's for dehydration from vomiting. Vets reccommending exploatory stomach surgery.  the 3rd winter the Seizures started along with the vomiting and this time I took her to a famous Veterinary School and Hospital.  They said all her x-rays and Ultra-sounds did not reveal any problems in her Esophagus, stomach or bowels.  The vomiting was the first form of seizure and her Central Nervous System was shutting down from using Frontline Plus.  Last Thanksgiving weekend I had to make the heart wrenching decision to give francine a final release from suffering seizures that could no longer be controlled with Phenobarbital.  It did work on the Fleas.</review>

<review id="8546">I received this product yesterday and the router's setup CD errored out almost immediately.  During the very start of the setup, when it scans for Internet ports, it kept reporting error 311, that I could not set up the router on a wireless connection (???).  My PC setup is a very simple arrangement.  I use Windows XP.  My Motorola cable modem is connected directly to an Ethernet port on the back of my PC.  A router or any wireless device has never been connected to my PC.  After checking my device/network settings (all fine) and rebooting the cable modem and PC, and retrying the setup CD several times, all with the same result (the error), I called Linksys Technical Support.  (I also found that others reported this same error on Linksys' forum, but the question was never answered).Support was horrible.  First off, it was so noisy there I could barely hear the guy.  He had problems hearing me as well, and he initially asked if I could call back on another phone.  I was calling on a land line phone, the problem was on his end... it sounded like a crowded party over there.  100 people all conversing at the same time.    I explained the problem.  He did not have me check anything on my PC or walk me through anything.  He came to the conclusion that the problem was a setting in my cable modem and he gave me 2 options.  #1, he could install "a diagnostic program" on my PC remotely, but this would cost $9.95.   #2, I can call my ISP (Cablevision) and have them make the modem "router-compatible".  Both options seemed ridiculous but I opted to call Cablevision and run this by them rather than pay $9.95, which I deemed unfair.In all honesty though, although my conversation with Linksys Support lasted all of ten minutes, I was happy to get off the phone with them as communicating through all the noise on his end was arduous to say the least.  As you probably suspected, Cablevision said there are NO setting in the modem that they can change, and the rep at Cablevision was very familiar with my router as he owns one himself.  He walked me through checking my network settings, etc.  He was familiar with the router's setup CD and the router's setup process.  We were on the phone for about 30 mins.  He was baffled and ended up telling me that I really needed to call Linksys Technical Support again.  I didn't call Linksys back.  In the end, I was able to set up the router without using the CD.  So far, so good.   As far as Linksys Technical Support is concerned though, they get a flying "F".  They were a useless waste of time.  I purchased this wireless router so my Playstation 3 can wirelessly connect to the Internet, and I have to add that the wireless setup on the PS3 side was amazing.  After finally getting the router set up, I dreaded the thought of setting up the PS3 to communicate with it, but as far as the PS3 end of it is concerned, it automatically configured and connected itself to the router's wireless signal in less than a minute.</review>

<review id="8547">Who wouldn't love a camcorder that is small, durable and shoots good quality video? Unfortunately the ATC 2K is not the solution.

<review id="8549">I use to own a Linksys router but I found myself having to reset it more than actual use.  I have three computers and a VoIP phone system and it was very unreliable.  I also work for a major cable company in customer care and Linksys routers generate a lot of calls for us because customers think it's their internet service and it's not.  I replaced mine with a Belkin and haven't had to reset it once in 6 months.  I just think you get what you pay for.  Yes, another brand may be more expensive but the consistant connection is far more important than price.  Not to mention that Linksys customer service department is in another country (good luck getting comprehensive help.)</review>

<review id="8550">This router did not solve my problem of receiving a signal from one end of the house to the other (about 60 feet).

<review id="8552">I am using it for both Skype and landline calls with 3-handset Uniden station. Sound quality is very good, no echo. When it works it works quite well as Skype as well as landline.Below are the issues I ran in so far:1. Utility crashes 100% if called number gives out busy signal (US). 2. Utility randomly crashes. I am yet to have a 24 hour period without restarting unit and skype. 3. Unit seems to be unable to tolerate even smallest power surges. I had power outage, that crashed unit and required  unplugging/plugging back DESPITE the fact that computer is on UPS and never even blinked. 4. Does not want to work with dual-port 2.0 USB card when external HD connected to second port, although works just fine on ancient (circa 2001) motherboard USB ports.5. Does not work too well with latest Skype software (skype bugs maybe??). Feels more "stable" when skype downgraded to version provided on CD. Downgrade did not rectify problems 1-4 listed above.Interesting toy, definitely not robust enough to be used as primary phone without backup landline or give to your grandma.</review>

<review id="8556">The series of which this book is a part reads as a twisted soap opera.  The heroine likes cuddling up to a stone hard, un-dead, icy-skinned, but somehow attractive guy that no one -including her father and the population of the town where they live - seems to notice is just a bit unusual.  In fact, the girl decides she would like to join her chilly boyfriend in his vampire existence.  The book's high rating can likely be attributed to its appeal to pre-teen/early teen girls who are intrigued by bad boys and other fascinating dangers. The author passes on the opportunity to address the several analogous social issues that could give interesting depth to the novel, for instance: to accept (or not) the outcasts among us, moral justification for morally unacceptable acts, or the attraction to danger suffered by many of our young people.  This book does not share insight, nor is it of a quality to warrant purchasing it.</review>

<review id="8559">Perhaps we received a defective product, but this "automatic portion control feeder" has dispensed double portions on several occasions, making it totally untrustworthy for portion control when no one is there to monitor the feeder.   We are returning the product and looking for a different style that we can rely on to control meal portions, because our cat is already overweight.</review>

<review id="8560">I have danced my whole life. Although I am not the quickest at picking up routines I found this impossible to follow. I practiced the first routine for days. You then have to find the actual routine by forwarding to it which is not easy to find.When she actually does the routine it is so fast it is impossible to follow. I tried for weeks and finally gave up. Many other reviews said the same thing but I thought my dance experience would make it easier for me. I was wrong. Her Mat DVD is really great.I also like Jillian Michaels dvd for cardio.</review>

<review id="8561">When this worked, it was a fine product. Unfortunately within the first year, my mic was giving me issues. I was always the guy on Live whose mic was giving everyone else static. Then just when the product was a year old the mic went out completely. Their customer service was helpful and sells a replacement part they say would probably fix the problem. The part is $5, but another $7 for shipping (for a tiny part that weighs a couple of ounces if that), and no guarantee that it will fix the problem. I might just go ahead and shop around for another headset with a better warranty, but they don't have much competition.</review>

<review id="8562">Microsoft's Mac unit did Mac users an injustice with Office 2008, bringing the package down to the functionality of Apple's iWork '08. Stripping VBA and the data analysis toolpak out of Excel is inexcusable, but it's even worse. Many of the Upgrades Microsoft made from Office XP to Office 2003, let alone Office 2007 are not included (e.g., right indent in Excel). Word and PowerPoint also seem more like Office XP as well. Sure formatting palettes are nice, but that's just repacking functionality, not improving it.As bad as the stripped down Office 2008 is, it gets worse. PPT, Word, and Excel crash so often on my new Leopard MacBook Pro, that I use iWork for most of my work and switch to the Windows version of Excel via VMWare Fusion when tasks demand them. I would suggest staying with Mac 2004 until Microsoft does an upgrade to the Office Suite that does more than change its packaging.</review>

<review id="8564">Oh PLEASE!!  None of my speakers will charge this stupid thing!!  Loaded with features I DON'T want.  Sure wish I had read the reviews.  My iPod was stolen, so I just got the newest.  They are always improved, right?  WRONG!  I am extremely disgusted.  Don't want the genius or cover flow or anything.  I want a music/audiobook player that does what I expect every time I touch it.  Now I have to find a speaker system that charges it. Or maybe get an older iPod, which I liked very much. THANKS FOR NOTHING, APPLE!!!  No wonder I never got into Macs.UPDATE:  Thankfully, a patch is available for coverflow, but I went on ebay and got an older g2 ipod.  Now I can charge it again.  I am MUCH happier with the older model.  Thanks Ebay!!The only thing I like is the purple color.  8-) Oh, and the fact that we are back to a long, slim design.  Easier to hold.</review>

I fluctuated a few pounds here and there but my weight at the beginning and at the end (and my average, yes I am a geek) didn't change from my first weigh in. But I don't think it was harmful either so I guess if you are curious and you can get it cheap, go ahead and try  it.

<review id="8566">This product will not work with Windows Vista. The support for it stinks. And no drivers available.Just stay away if you have Windows Vista.Just goto their side to forum and check it out your self.I wrote my review on Feb 25. 08 Vista come out November 2007 that makes 4 month + that there was no drivers or support for it. The company was to slow release the drivers for Vista and even in April the only drivers were there was Beta.What happen in may or april has nothing to do at the time of my review. Is just like now I have drivers and my Keyboard is running at full speed.Now I can give 4 Stars...</review>

<review id="8567">I agree with many of the other reviews, this book went in a totally different direction from the previous novels.  I think what made those other books so good was her characters, how we can identify with them and what they are going through.  But with this book that is gone before you reach the quarter mark.  Once you find out she's pregnant then BAM! off to a new style and angle.  It became all about the baby and that left me cold and feeling left out too (just like Edward).  If SM used a different style originially I wouldn't have been so annoyed by this but on the other hand thats thats why I love the books and have read them over and over again.This won't turn me off to SM's work in the future.  I thought The Host was great, also very much character centered.  But she tried to change herself into an action writer in this one book and that just isn't her style.</review>

<review id="8568">Unless you want to spend more money after buying this item, find a hard disk that will actually work as advertised.  It won't work on either of my laptops, and I had to buy from Western Digital's online store (the only place the device is available) a power cord for $10 + $7 shipping.  Western Digital ended up charging me twice for said cord, so that so far it's cost me $35 and the item has not even shipped.  The drive seems cheaply made, too.  I'm regretting I wasted my money on it when I could have had something better from Seagate or Toshiba.  You might think you are saving money by buying a Passport, but if you have to be overcharged and frustrated when nothing is done about the extra charges, and the device doesn't work on your computer, you are not saving a thing, but looking to buy yourself a large helping of animosity.</review>

<review id="8569">Only had mine a few days when I noticed that I was always pulling hard to the right on takeoff.  I then went in and calibrated which helped a tiny bit, but then in game when looking at the ranges, with my feet OFF the pedal, the right pedal or 'brake' shows as if it's pushed down a decent amount.  They 'look' like they are level and plumb next to each other, however if you push the back part of the right pedal down, it will go close to or on zero...but you'd have to keep HARD pressure to do so.Seems like many others are complaining about this same issue on here and esp on other forums.I am attempting to get this resolved as mine aren't very old, hopefully I can return these to amazon for a full refund and get another pair that maybe cheaper in quality but hey, they work right?  And that's what matters.The materials seem of very good quality, but they should have extended the back further and ditched the heel cups.  You have to keep your feet in there which is not a relaxed state like in a real aircraft.Not sure what they were thinking when they designed and made these things.  Oh btw they slide on the floor all over the place.  I would have thought they would have at least put an option for suction cups or grip thatches to hold it to various types of floor (hardwood or carpet)Alas - it really doesn't matter, their design is defective.I guess if you don't mind the heel cups, work something to keep it from moving (thus making you have to sit the same ALL the time), and don't use the forward 'gas/brake' features and only using it for flying and rudder - you might be happy with them...???I feel bad as my only reviews seem to come from negative experiences.  I've gotten a million things from Amazon with very little to no problems and they are usually as advertised or better! I feel it's my responsibility to steer people off of bad products as I would want them to do that for me. :)</review>

<review id="8570">This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      I love Pixar, but everyone preaching that Wall-E is some sort of modern masterpiece is making me sick.Now the movie wasn't horrible, but come-on folks - it's nothing to tell your friends about and I certainly wouldn't watch it again.I would actually say it's one of Pixar's poorest movies yet. Poor story, poor animation, poor music. Well ok, it was a horrible story. Haven't we seen/read/watched this same story a dozen times before? Add robots and it's new, right?Reviewman says: Bargain DVD rack if you really need to buy it, got mine used for six bucks and feel I overpaid.</review>

<review id="8571">This is the worst Turbo Tax ever. Don't buy it. I've used it for a few years and bought it again because it imports last year's tax information. I wish I'd bought another product! I've spent more time trying to figure out how to deal with the errors on my own, writing to the store I bought it from, plus 2.5 hours!!! on the phone talking to TT support.  IT STILL DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY! I could have done my taxes on a written form faster! DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.</review>

<review id="8572">This replaced a Netgear BEFW11S4 router, which was hideously inept at keeping its wireless signal up or doing port-forwarding.  After buying the Netgear, which I thought was a better brand, I'm not sure I'm much better off.As I work, I can see the wireless signal drop from full strength to nothing for a few seconds, then come back.  At other times, I've turned on a computer to find the signal gone and unwilling to come back - this can be fixed by plugging into an ethernet port, visiting the configuration page and simply "OK"ing the wireless settings, without changing anything.  Of course, if ethernet were convenient to me, I wouldn't need the wireless.  As it is, a device that fails every few days and needs to be reset is wholly unacceptable.  It is better than the Linksys only because resetting the Linksys didn't always work, and on the Netgear, resetting does always work.Nevertheless, home users shouldn't have to baby their network devices, particularly if you need wireless because your computer is physically nowhere near your DSL terminal or cable modem.  This class of devices cannot fail, and even with the latest firmware this one does, a lot.  One star.Update: 8/04.  The internet port, which connects the router to the DSL modem, died this week.  I put in a report on the tech support page, detailing what had happened and what I'd done to isolate the problem, and I got a response three days later (24 hours, my butt).  The response was a typically patronizing walkthrough of the most basic setup and testing that you can get to the configuration page.  Well, of course, I can get to the configuration page - it's getting from the router to the internet (specifically, to the DSL modem) that's busted.  Oh, and the e-mail was barely in English - more offshored support from a company that sees customers as nothing more than expense.  Thank goodness these things are getting reasonably inexpensive, because you have to assume at this point that once a router dies, it's dead forever, and the warranty is worthless if you can't get an RMA.</review>

<review id="8574">I was tingling with excitement to read this new book.  I was thrilled that it was big and heavy and full of pages and pages of story. Surprised too, upon opening the book to find Bella's wedding so imminent, but nonetheless eager.But I was at a loss when I continued.  Yes, I finished the book, but namely because I was curious as to how Meyer would tie up her final novel of the series.  In retrospect I wish I had not.  I feel that many of her characters, Bella especially, slipped farther and farther away from her character with each turning of a page. * SPOILER * Really, Bella is hiding things from Edward, wanting a child, in love with this destructive embryonic thing?  The mind connection between the fetus and Bella seems sick and twisted. I half expected that the reason for Bella's strange and out of character actions and reactions were related entirely to the evil powers of the fetus.  Shockingly, not so.The book was twisted and unbelievable.  A sure disappointment.  I am a reader who falls in love with characters.  These were not the characters I have come to know.  The shoddy happily-ever-after was sitting on a plot stretched to breaking; the holes and implausibility poking through in every direction. So, in short, I would not recommend this book.  Although I have been enamored by Meyer's previous works, this felt like an extreme let down.</review>

<review id="8576">My Flip stopped working after about an hours use and the batteries started to overheat. Unfortunately, I had some video of my newborn daughter in the camera that I had not yet had a chance to download to my computer.  Flip Video said to return the camera and they would repair it and try to recover the videos.  Instead, they simply sent me a new camera with a form letter implying it was my repaired camera with wonderful new upgrades.  The videos are now lost forever. Had I known they had no intention of recovering the video, I would have brought the camera to the tech guys over at the university to see what they could do with it and probably have purchased a new one 'cause it is kind of a neat little unit. Now I'm stuck with an identical camera with no guarante it won't do the same thing and no video which I considered priceless.Yes, it is a fun little camera and yes, they replaced the defective camera with an identical one. NO, I will not buy another pure digital product because of their DISHONEST customer service.UPDATE:After I wrote this review I received this email:"We had initially shipped your camcorder to you without your videos, inorder for you to use the unit during the holiday. Since your unit wouldnot power on, we had to forward it to our engineering team for videoextraction. After much effort, they have been unable to retrieve yourvideos. We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience."I guess they deserve more than one star.  As I said earlier, it is a fun little camera. Just make sure to download any videos you want to keep right away.</review>

<review id="8577">At first it does a great job of producing a uniform grind. And then after a while it still does a good job, but now it's a different fineness of grind! After using a few times, the accumulated coffee dust must either misalign the burrs or something, but the fineness of the grind slowly changes as you go through the beans in the hopper. Then, after you clean it you start over again.A second, even bigger, flaw and one that is inexcusable is the fact that the delivery mechanism that takes coffee from the grinders to the bucket holds enough coffee for a single shot of espresso! In other words, when you grind enough coffee for one shot, you're not getting the coffee you just ground, you're getting the coffee that was ground up LAST time! Ridiculous. Apparently, they expect you to NOT use the capacity of the hopper and grind only what you plan to use all the way through the system every time. But then why have a hopper to begin with?Ground coffee does not do well when exposed to air, and so if you notice that subsequent cups of coffee made with this machine start to taste bad, you'll know why. Using this product correctly is incredibly inconvenient, and requires a lot of cleaning and dumping in beans every time you want to use it. As good as some of the features of this are, I can't recommend it. The folks who love it are probably not aware of the delivery mechanism issue and probably don't know that the perfect grind coming out of their beloved machine was probably ground the day before.</review>

<review id="8584">I was very happy with the product initially, but then came home from vacation to find the connection had dropped.  No internet connection was possible when the router was installed.  Perhaps it was due to a nearby lightning strike, but nothing else in our house had problems.  In any case, the direct port use for our desktop stopped working altogether.  I tried other ports but the unit was unable to get an IP.  The manual is no help.  Time for the trash, then off to the store for some other brand.</review>

<review id="8586">If you can find a substantive improvement in this product compared to the 2004 version (other than native Intel code), more power to you.

<review id="8587">The Flip is a very cool idea. Camcorder in your pocket! And it's pretty fun when your out with your friends and want to catch some footage of one of them making a fool of themselves. But that is about where the cool factor ends. You cannot take stills, which now causes you to carry two cameras.  I also had SEVERAL technical problems with the built-in software. I am still unable to edit on the supposed movie maker it comes with because it didn't automatically install and when I try to manually do so following the directions given in the troubleshooting section, nothing. If this camera were, say, $50-60 bucks it would be worth your money. But you are better off putting your money towards a decent digital camera that takes video.</review>

<review id="8588">I gave the Flip Ultra as a Christmas gift. Out of the box my son had no problem taking videos without instructions. That was a positive since it doesn't really come with much of a guide. Our problems started the day after when he tried to install the self contained software to edit his movies. "Installation Failure" is what he received so we rebooted and tried again, same error. Checked the website and found a firmware update which installed without problems. It didn't help and still received the same error. I tried it with the antivirus and firewall shut down, again same thing. Tried it on my laptop, same thing. Searched Flip's website but its support area is pretty lame and doesn't offer any real trouble shooting advice. Finally tried it on a third computer and It Worked (??) but its not the computer the software needs to be on...so back it goes. Not sure why it worked on one out three computers but the software was one of the selling points for getting it. Even without the installation working I could copy the movies off of it with windows explorer. All my systems run XP sp2 with DirectX 9 and Media Player 10 and more than meet hardware requirements. At the price of many real camcorders this buggy device was a big disappointment made worse by the fact that I gave it as a Xmas gift.</review>

<review id="8589">What a shock to find out that this camcorder can be the only device connected to my MacBook Pro via the 1394 (Firewire) port.

It drops my connection on a daily basis and even minor changes to the wireless settings must be done after reverting to factory default.

<review id="8594">This is the worst company I have dealt with.There was a minor typo in the delivery address (690 instead of 960 for the house number), which I noticed soon after it shipped. I tried contacting UPS/USPS to straighten out - they said the sender needed to change the address, but this shouldn't be a problem. AntOnline declined to help.I wanted to order another and save the wait (thinking there's be a refund coming on the first), but AntOnline didn't help me in reordering.After 3 weeks, after the unit was returned, undelivered, to AntOnline, they issued a credit for the item minus shipping and also minus a restocking fee of another $3. I asked AntOnline to reconsider the restocking fee since I still wanted to (re)order the item, but they refused.Basically, I'm out of pocket about $10 on an $18 item that I never saw. AntOnline apparently don't want my business, so I will never use them again - this is the worst customer service I've ever encountered.I urge you not to use these guys.</review>

<review id="8597">Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)      This latest version of Office for Mac gave me what I needed: the ability to open those damn "docx" and "xlsx" files that users of Office 2008 make with no thought for those who haven't ponied up the cash.  So, I got what I wanted out of it.But if no one saved files in those formats... if folks thought about backwards compatibility...  I wouldn't have bothered with Office 2008 for Mac.  The only real bonus (to me) is its smaller HDD footprint.Otherwise, the programs all load slower and eat just as much RAM... if not more.If you have an older version of Office for Mac, or if iWorks does the trick for you... don't bother with Office 2008 for Mac.

<review id="8598">This was Sonicare's last chance to earn and keep my business...and they blew it.  This particular model was in some ways a big improvement over their previous design...more streamlined and not prone to gunking up.Very simply it worked great in all respects right up until it stopped working.  The first symptom after just 45 days of use was the the brush head would no longer seat properly...causing the brush head to vibrate off.  Next after about 60 days the brush stopped moving.  It did't appear to be a battery issue as I could hear the internal motor humming...it was just not engaging/driving the brush head anymore.This device is WAY to expensive to have these kinds of issues in the first year...let alone in the first 90 days.  I don't have time to chase down warrenties and mail this back to get fixed.  I simply ordered an Oral B and won't go back to Sonicare.</review>

<review id="8601">i finished BD just over a week ago and still find myself wondering how it all went so horribly wrong... for jacob. you can read the other reviews for all the details on bella and edward's perfect happy ending, the lame non-battle, the impossible baby. but i for one decided at the end of new moon that i didn't even like bella and that jacob was too good for her crazy self (and i mean that literally, i was so hoping for a logical reason for the audio hallucinations of edward's voice in that book. when it didn't come i realized just how much psycho bella belongs with stalkerish over-controlling edward, but i digress). so i pretty much read the rest of the series knowing that she and edward would end up together but really wanting to see how ms. meyer would make it all up to jacob. therein lies my disappointment. in the end he ends up with a child as his soulmate... sure he has less time to wait for her to grow up than quil and his 2 year old child love. and maybe it could've been alright if not for the introduction of nahuel, another half human/half vampire, and the allusion that jacob may have some competition for renesmee in the future... so it wasn't enough that he had to give up absolutely everything in his fight for bella? he now may face yet another battle? oh and apparently renesmee is immortal... and jacob is not (no members of the original werewolf pack are still around, right?). and jacob cannot become an immortal because vampire venom is actually poisonous to wherewolves (and even if it was possible that would be sick). what the hell? was this the best she could do for him after everything he did for the vampires? she really missed the mark with this particular plot twist.the only reason i'm giving this book two stars is to acknowledge the storyteling talent of stephanie meyer. because i cannot deny that i was sucked into the story ... especially since i was spit right back out of it at the end.</review>

Attempting to create macros was a dismal failure in part because of the absence of any literature in the manual, on line (both product website and user forums), or available through the companies scant 'support' facilities.  When support was requested via email (the only means of making contact) the response did not address the questions submitted and pointed me to the user forums.  Seems they like selling the device much more than supporting the device. The keys on the pad are pretty much flat which affords no traction during use and fingers regularly slip off of them during game play.  The device rests on hard plastic feet which allows it to slide around presenting a problem when game action is high.  Found myself having to reposition it several times per-session.Overall: Regret making the purchase.</review>

<review id="8605">I switched from Turbotax after the pricing fiasco. Taxcut was fairly easy to use, but:- My one "free" question to a tax adviser was never answered. - Unlike Turbotax, multiple state efiles are not possible. I now have to print and mail my second. What a pain.</review>

<review id="8607">This version of Office 2008 is an improvement over Office 2004 in that it runs natively now on an Intel Mac. It is a major improvement in speed. And the stability has improved in that it has not crashed on me in the week it has been in use. Office 2004 used to crash almost daily before. If you do not have an Intel Mac do not bother with this upgrade. You are better off with Office 2004.The look on Office 2008 is aesthetically pleasing and is more consistent with the elegant look of OSX.That is about the best I have to say for this new upgrade. Word is so buggy I feel like I am working with a Beta version. I work a great deal with Spaces in Leopard and I have found that Word documents will jump to other windows. I have also found that when working in the notebook layout it can become unstable and partially disappear on me. The work arounds I have been using to stop this is I minimize the documents or I open another program in the Spaces window and then return to the document.Word is still an excellent word processing program. The Notebook layout is essential for the note taking that I have to do, which other word processing programs don't have. Since I have to share documents with others it is handy to have a standard program with which to work. The default format in Word is now Microsoft's .docx (xtml), which can be changed in the preferences to the more universal .doc.When I have gone to the Microsoft website they have admitted that many of these problems are bugs and that they are being addressed. Another work around that MS recommended in Word was to create a new template from which to operate as it seems that the present template can be easily corrupted.Since Office 2008 no longer works with macros and Visual Basic I have had to abandon the Excel self-calculating Invoice template I used to use all the way back to my PC days. I am now using a template that is in Pages - that works beautifully. The reason I am sticking with Excel over Numbers is that Excel is still a more powerful program. It keeps track of things that Numbers won't keep track of.I am happier that Entourage is now more stable and responds better than the 2004 version. The My Day widget is a nice idea, but there is almost no room for customization and really makes no difference to how I organize my day.I am left wondering if Microsoft is planning to go out of business. It seems that their products are getting worse. It is as if they have become bereft of any sense of creativity or innovation.;0) I had read that Office 2008 was designed by Mac enthusiasts. I think that was Microsoft propaganda. The impression I get is that Microsoft does not care about Mac business.Is this a worthwhile upgrade? Not yet. If you can wait for the bugs to be worked out it will be a more satisfying upgrade. If you are dependent upon Visual Basic, or are operating on a PPC, save your money.</review>

<review id="8608">It is so obvious that this miniseries is trying to portray John Adams (Paul Giamatti) in the best possible light, as if he's the most enlightened man in the movement for rule of law, racial equality, and political correctness. It completely downplays his viewpoints (and those of slave owner Thomas Jefferson, who built Monticello with slave labor) that would send any modern feminist or Marxist critic into a tizzy. Because this miniseries is so worried about offending people, it comes across as disingenuous, plodding, and inconsequential -- the perfect Sunday night soporific for HBO viewers who want to be lulled into complacent sleep before starting their harried work weeks. The relationship between John and Abigail Adams (Laura Linney) is passionless and arid, as if their marriage rested solely on chats about democratic ideals and legal principles. Ultimately, there is no insight on Adams as a person. We see each episode of his life, in dry serialistic form, but the series portrays him not as a man, but more as a historical ideal.</review>

<review id="8609">I have been using this keyboard since March 2008, All in all its worked great. But there have been some glitches , and Ideazone's customer support is non existant. Numerous e-mails to tech support zero answers.You are forced to either give up, fix it yourself or get help from other users in the online community.They claim to have a 1 year warranty, but since they have no support phone number and do not answer e-mails... I guess its a moot point.</review>

<review id="8610">We received the netbook and were very happy with it for a week, then it would not boot windows. It just kept on re-booting on us. We had to use recover and lost all our stuff. This wasn't too bad because we had very little on it. It happened again a week later. When I contact Acer I was told it was some third party software that I had installed, I knew right away I was not going to get good help with them. I returned the Acer to Amazon utilizing their excellant 30 day return policy. We then went with the MSI wind netbook and have been very pleased.</review>

<review id="8613">This applies to the expanded version. This will be known as a if not the bait and switch of the new age.  When people tell you how wonderful The Secret is, they will be telling you about the Original version with Abraham-Hicks in it.  The expanded version has been commercialized, with a holllywood sound track and is nothing more now than a marketing tool for the people in the movie. Skip this 'expanded' version and get the original, what I called 'the movie I waited my whole life to see' the first time I saw it.  There is a reason why the original consistently sells for more than $50 on ebay. I have been involved in new thought/metaphysics for 25 years, and believe me you might get some benefit from watching the expanded version, but only if you are new to the whole idea of what is presented here.  We were so disappointed that we didn't even bother to watch it (expanded edition) to the end.  We got this expanded version through the spiritual cinema circle, and if the DVD didn't have some other short movies on it, it would definitely be in the trash. A letter from the Hicks to the Director of the movie said they allowed the removal of 'the teaching the movie was based on' because it felt like the path of least resistance.  Save your money, skip this video and go to the [...] web site and get the real teaching.</review>

<review id="8614">It would be nice to know how long batteries last on the product... Here's a typical scenario involving this product: Big dog, 70 lbs, very stubborn, likes to dig under fences, jump on people, needs training. Getting the collar on him is a chore since he kicks his feet up whenever you try to get it on him. Once you do get the collar on him and have it all set, within a week the battery runs out, regardless of how often you use it. So basically, your dog is jumping on everyone and making a complete fool of himself, the perfect time to use the static device to train him and you have to replace batteries since the collar actually needs a car battery attached to it to actually be effective. IMO, its seems to be more of a punishment to actually attach a leash to the collar since even the smallest probe on the kit is so long that it can injure the dog's neck if he pulls on the leash too hard. If it's too loose it will not give good contact with the skin and thus not work, and according to the manual if it's too tight, it can cause "necrotic dermatitis" aka dead skin. If you get it just right you run out of batteries in no time. If he pulls on the collar it can injure him. His neck is too short to put another collar on him just for the leash. I no longer keep the collar on him for fear of him injuring himself with the metal probes, and unfortunatley its been opened and cannot be returned. This was a complete waste of 115 dollars and I would never recommend this product to anyone.</review>

<review id="8615">I used TurboTax for many years, but last year they surprised me with a $35.90 fee to e-file one federal and one state return. $35.90 just to e-file is ridiculous. So I thought I'd try Taxcut. But in looking at their software, they say the package includes federal and state returns, and includes 5 federal e-files. What's with that - most people want a single federal and a single state return, and they don't say anywhere what they'll charge to e-file the state return. Does Taxcut also employ the "surprise 'em with a high e-file fee" after they buy the product? The non-disclosure is maddening.</review>

<review id="8617">I purchased this machine with high hopes.  The first few loaves turned out well.  After three weeks, the loaves and the bread bucket began to get scorch marks and the bread too had black marks.  I was getting nervous that this was going to cause a fire.Panasonic pre-paid to have this machine sent for repair after I used this machine for three weeks.  The repair shop kept it for 10 weeks.  When it was returned, they did not replace the burned bread bucket, and it was still scorched.  After baking bread again, the burning was getting worse on the bread, and it looks like burnt toast on the crust.  Panasonic is sending the machine back for repair again.  It has been four months now, and I have only had this machine for use for three weeks.  After it is repaired this time, I am going to put it up for sale on amason.com and purchase a Zorishee...or however it's spelled.</review>

<review id="8620">I just bought the Hamilton Beach 52277 Classic Chrome 12-Speed Blender, Silver (for under six bills with shipping) to replace an aging but still working Osteriser (that had lasted two decades). With 800 watts, my new one is far more powerful. I also like the glass jar (as my Oster had) for being able to blend hot soups. The heavier Hamilton lid is very flexible but somehow survives the dishwasher without any softening (unlike the Oster). Moreover, the gear teeth the jar sits on are straight (rather than angled - what was starting to regularly slip on my old Oster) for a better fit. Even though I rarely use more than fast, slow, and pulse (the Hamilton blender has ten speeds and pulse), I'm glad I picked this one over the Oster 4093 Classic Beehive Blender, Chrome with its noisier but weaker 500 watts, the need to handwash a loose fitting lid, and just two speeds (on and pulse). Finally, I have also seen greater splashing as others have commented elsewhere from the new "Wave-Action" blade (common to both blenders) when dealing with very thick additives (but, the tighter lid of the Hamilton should mean it's less likely to spill than the Oster). I'm posting this review here as a comparison for those considering this chrome Oster blender.</review>

<review id="8621">Always desired this keyboard and finally purchased it. Everything worked great, loved the lighted keyboard and soft touch keys. Unfortunately after awhile my system started responding erratically, after troubleshooting, I found that when I used another keyboard all of the problems went away!

Extremely impressed with how fast I recieved the replacement and how simple returning the original was, most impressive!</review>

<review id="8622">I went in to read this sequel looking to see how Meyer improved or matured her writing style with her sequel, however to say I was disappointed in the end is an understatement. I wanted her to fix the problems ever present in her first book only to see them perpetuated in magnification in the sequel, which makes me wonder if she even realizes the flaws that will most likely follow in the third book.For starters part of what made the first book intriguing despite it's dry, boring, moody, and shallow protagonist (yea you guessed it Bella) was the mystery that was Edward Cullen. After the mystery was unraveled it was then the danger that surrounded him that added to the fire of engagement. For the most part Edward and his family pretty much make the book, and without them well...we'd be stuck with Bella and there are few people who would read that book and describe the experience as pleasurable. What I wanted Meyer to do that she failed to do in the first book is to give Bella a personality, at the very least give the reader a reason to like or even care about her or even connect with her in some way. But even that was even more of a pathetic attempt than what we saw in the first book.Meyer pretty much cow-towed Bella's very existence into loving Edward Cullen. Throughout the book all Bella does is cry about how she misses her beautiful Edward, acting as if someone had died which at the very core of the matter is disturbing. Things do pick up when Bella starts hanging with Jacob Black though. I'll admit that those chapters were most likely the most exciting part of this sequel considering Bella and Jacob had actual chemistry. It wasn't even just that, it was that Bella had actual reasons for liking Jacob in being in his company. But Bella is so shallow and mental that she'd rather be with a "beautiful" person who she shares no real common interests with but still wants to be turned into a vampire as well so she won't grow old cause lord knows getting older is the worst possible thing that could happen to you.This sequel get's a star less than its predecessor because the protagonist is simply an empty shell chasing after shallow hopes and dreams and thinking of no one but herself all the while. My head keeps telling me not to waste time on the 3rd one but having liked the character Jacob Black I do want to see what happens to him. As for Bella, I'm starting to wonder how Meyer could have fashioned this awful character and then admit to likening her to the daughter she never had.</review>

<review id="8624">Purchased the Omron HR-100C Heart Rate Monitor due to the great review in Consumer Reports Magazine (February 2009 issue).  They ranked it number 3 for heart-rate monitors.  My first problem was the chest strap and the wrist watch.  I am a woman, 5'3 and 130 pounds, and both the strap and watch were to big for me.  I thought that was why I was not getting an acurate reading.  I had my son who is much bigger than I am try the monitor, and he could not get an acurate reading either.  We followed the directions carefully and tried over a two day period to get this thing to work.  If he could get it to work, I was going to let my son keep it.  But unfortunately he was unable to get an acurate reading at all!  He said to me "Mom, you get what you pay for", and he's right!  I've only owned one other monitor before, and it was a Polar.  They are more money but I'd rather spend the money and have it work correctly!</review>

<review id="8627">Let's be clear on something... you will quickly outgrow the Flip Mino. While it is easy to capture video, the second you want to edit the video in anything other than Flip's bundled in software you are going to run into issues. I won't dive too deep into the tech geek issues, but the core issue is that the Flip Mino uses a codec (video playback standard) that is built purely around watching video and not around editing. So, say you want to edit a bit of the birthday party using a standard program like Adobe Premiere - sorry can't do it. You will only get sound and no video. So the Flip Mino is great for kids or people who don't really want to interact with their PC, just plug and play. It is definitely not for parents who want to begin capturing memories of their family only to discover that it will be very difficult to edit them in the future. Purely for Novice users.

<review id="8630">(Spoilers)Meyer created a wonderful world with her Twilight series.  Who couldn't love her characters?  Who didn't think that Edward was the best thing since sliced bread?  I wanted Edward and Bella to be together forever and for her to become a vampire. However, I never expected Meyer to change the rules of the universe the she created so dramatically.  What a deal breaker!  Through the honeymoon it felt like the rest of the books that I had known and loved.  The characters were there and I was happy.  Then, the twist - Bella gets pregnant! A vampire/human baby?  Really?  According to Meyer, vampires could not have babies - what happened?  It was all downhill from there - what a disappointment.  Even though it was 700+ pages, I felt like Meyer was blowing through the story.  The interactions between the characters seemed superficial and insignifigant.  I still wonder what the plot was - the wedding, the baby, Bella becoming a vampire, the Volturi?  It was as if Meyer tried to cram every possible story into one and none of them were very good.  From day one, I wanted Edward to change Bella and then when it happened it was so anti-climatic.  It was empty - she was different but not really Bella and not really not.  And, Edward became less and less like the Edward we loved as the book progressed - such a let down.It felt like Meyer wanted to make everyone happy instead of writing the book that should have been written - the one we all expected.</review>

<review id="8631">It kills me that I am giving this anything less than 5 stars, but, I am being generous with 2.I have been wanting one of these since the 700 series, and each release had issues to be resolved, so I waited until the 901.   The function and battery issues appeared to be fixed, and finally on it's wait to a worry free system.    Not even close, at least for me.I bought this two full months ago, at 40% more than the current price.  However, two months later, I am finally able to use it.   I'm not feeling too great about finally getting a system to work two months later and it now costing 40% less.  My system had countless system failures resulting in numerous formats and reinstallations.  The first problem was with the Linux compatibility.  When the system is not working with the OS, you start to think you are doing something wrong.  Dealing with Asus email "support" was completely useless.   They might reply, and when they do, it's about a week later, and then of course it's an irrelevant form letter response.   Which means you have to call.   First, the number in the manual is wrong.  I found the correct number on their web site, but then their 24/7 support is actually 9-5... and when you finally get someone to answer, you of course wait endlessly, but get a moron.   NOT ONE of the DOZENS of phone support people even knew what Linux was.  I eventually got someone who heard of it, and knew nothing about what I was talking about.   Their resolution was telling me to install XP.  Well, since I had no other choice, that is what I did.  So, add another hundred to the cost, not to mention my waste of time.  I have XP installed, and everything is basically ok now.  However, there is so much about it that I hate, that I feel stuck with it.   It gets way too hot.  The battery life is not as advertised... it might last about two hours if you are lucky, depending on what you are doing.  Bluetooth might work, or just disappear... before and after Linux.  It is much heavier and bulky than expected.  The keyboard is a joke... not for size, but durability.  I could go on and on.    There are so many other options at this point, I wish I waited.   Dell, Sony, and others all have or are coming out with much more reliable, lighter, and more efficient models.   Asus got greedy with a GREAT concept, and screwed the consumer.    Never again.</review>

<review id="8632">I'm running Vista, and that was problem #1. The drivers that ship with it don't work on Vista. Calling D-Link customer service is an exercise in anger management. Unbelievably complex menus to get to a technician. And they require you to give name, phone, email, address, before they will even begin to talk with you.The product still won't work after downloading updated drivers. It's trying to engage, but it won't.An hour is too long to spend trying to set up a simple product like this. (That's what I get for being cheap!)

<review id="8633">I bought this unit because of its great recommendation from a leading consumer magazine. The coffee it made was pretty good. After only 2 months, or about 60 pots of coffee in our household, the warmer plate became rusty and imparted that rust on the bottom of the carafe. Not a big deal, but not a pretty sight either. Then at six months the coffeemaker started making popping noises when brewing and the brew process began taking up to 30 minutes. Within a few days after that it just stopped working completely. This, in my opinion, is way too short a life for a product no matter what the price. Never again will I buy a Black & Decker. There's no reason an appliance like this should fail at 6 months when used 5 or 6 times a week. I've switched back to a coffeemaker by that German sounding company that I've had good luck with in the past.</review>

<review id="8634">Well, bad idea writing this review, as it is likely to reduce my chances of receiving good $$ for this item on ebay.I've had this version 6 for a bit under a year, and it's been a faithful hobby taking up hours of my time to get it working again.  Most of the time I'd spend a week with it disconnected.It took a while to set up, along with 3 calls to a rather tedious customer service (though open 24 hours/day) It would work dependably for several weeks, then quit.  After hours of tinkering and calls to customer service, it would start again and work for a bit more time 'till it again failed.Documentation seemed to cover nothing of relevance.This last time, they told me customer service had expired, and I would have to pay per minute for service.  Aha!  I realized that my time had value, so why not just junk the thing.  The next time linksys was on sale, I bought their wireless router, installed it in 15 minutes (including crawling around my cable warren) and fortunately cannot report on customer service, as I've needed none.I found:reliability: unreliabledocumentation: virtually non-existentcustomer service: unacceptiblesecurity: confusing for me to set up, though linksys was automatic.packaging: cute, but the attachable legs keep falling off, making it unstable when standing on end.competition: linksys: works fine so far.             d-link has a bad rep. for customer service and reliability, though I have not tried them.regards,</review>

<review id="8635">If you're thinking of buying this product, please notice the large amount of 1 star reviews.  Many customers, myself included, got a new blender that did not work at all.  Aside from that, the attachments are terribly difficult to change out.  I am young and have no arthritis but still struggle to remove the attachments.  Only the whisk attachment works on mine.  I haven't used it, just tested all the attachments when the chopper didn't work.  My advide: buy a separate chopper and immersion blender.</review>

<review id="8636">The machine is overall very functional. However my unit developed a problem of simply freezing up after 10 minutes of being left alone. Samsung tech support could not resolve the issue after complete restores. Probably just the one bad apple of the bunch. If the machine worked consistently I'd have kept it. However the constant freezing is unacceptable as it requires continuous hard resets. It's heading back and I think I'll get the MSI/wind.</review>

<review id="8638">I have had two previous Linksys routers (one wi-fi) than worked decently though were somewhat confusing and time-consuming to set up for a non-techie like me. I needed to extend my wireless coverage so I bought both this and the Apple. The Linksys took me about an hour to set up and the Apple took about 10 minutes. The Linksys did not send signal to as large an area as did the Apple, even using the Linksys N-band USB receiver for my laptop. The Apple cost about $30 more. All in all, in a head to head comparison, the Apple was much better for me in wi-fi home coverage and also easier to set up.</review>

<review id="8639">Used it for 1 day. I've never seen a router so unstable. It kept crashing and reseting every 2-3 min. 5GHz N band did not work at all.

<review id="8640">My vet refuses to carry this product as the pyrethrin aka permethrin is highly toxic to most mammals (dogs, cats, humans...). It should not be used on any dog that comes in contact with cats especially. Cats will react more quickly to the product as they don't metabolize the toxins as quickly and humans and dogs. Your pet does not need to lick it to become poisoned. The chemical is absorbed into the skin, readily. Imagine giving your dog enough toxin to kill fleas a month after application. Isn't that over-kill? There are less-toxic alternatives, but I'm not sure that any of the big-name brands are actually safe. If the instructions require you to wash your hands after applying them- why is it Ok to leave it on your pet's skin? I never understood that.  Read the last paragraph for natural flea-prevention tips.Permetrhins are toxic. However, given to a dog in small doses, you may not notice effects for many months or years. Your dog may be having headaches and other neurologic signs but you may not know. A dog that has seemed fine with this product for years may suddenly hit a threshold level that causes severe and noticeable neurologic problems. Death from pyrethrins is a lot more common than you think. Bayer will likely always deny that their product killed a pet. The owners often believe the company. This is why so many of the deaths (and near-deaths) are unreported. The best we can do is make sure reports are kept track of and if the proper authorities are not looking out for us, we need to look our for outselves and form a class-action lawsuit. Unfortunately the most that Bayer would ever have to pay out is is vet bills, legal fees, and the actual cost of any pets killed. There is no compensation for an owner's or pet's pain and suffering under current laws. They make so much money off of this product that they don't care if it keeps killing. Most drug companies are this way. Get used to it if you want to be a user of mainstream medications.My pets don't require flea-preventives because they are on a raw diet. The flea-repelling quality of raw-fed pets does not occur overnight, so don't expect your fleas to disappear if you switch your pet's diet. It took me months to get my pets naturally flea free. There are all natural flea remedies out there such as Diatomaceous Earth Concern 97064 Diatomaceous Earth Crawling Insect Killer 4 Pound Bagand "Natural Defense"Sentry Natural Defense Flea & Tick Squeeze-On for Dogs & Puppies over 40 lbs (6 month dose - 4.5 mL applicators)  Please try these before loading your pet and home with toxins. For your carpet and home you can use a simple Boric Acid powder (Such as Borax- which is cheap and easy to find).

<review id="8641">I have two of these hard drives.  I originally bought them because you couldn't beat the price.  I use one as a storage backup and one as a short term backup.  I trusted that my storage backup would be there in case the short term back up went out.  Not the case.  I went to plug it up and found that it had starting clicking though it worked perfectly last time I backed up my data on it.  This clicking problem is apparently a very common sign of hard drive failure.  It is toast unless I want to pay out the wazoo to get my data recovered by a professional service.  Now here I am with no back up of my data since BOTH Western Digital My Books have failed.  The worst part is that they are 3 weeks out of warranty.  It is ridiculous to think that even if you backup frequently and do everything they say to do, your data can still disappear forever.  I guess you get what you pay for.I recommend carefully reading many reviews and likely problems before you purchase a hard drive made by Western Digital.  This company has really let us down.</review>

<review id="8643">It seemed that with each new book in the captivating Twilight series that Stephanie Meyer created fresh, emotional, and somehow realistic (in spite of the obvious supernatural connection) plotlines with the solid characters we've grown to love. Except, that is, for this final installment. (**Spoiler Warning**)Was I expecting Edward and Bella to declare their undying (literally) love? Of course. Did I think Jacob would finally imprint? Certainly. Did I suspect that there would be an ultimate showdown between the Cullens and their various antagonists? Without a shadow of a doubt. These, at least, Stephanie Meyer does deliver.But I did NOT expect it all to play out as it did in Breaking Dawn. Right from the get-go, Breaking Dawn seems to cast its familiar characters in unfamiliar, uncharacteristic lights. It then manages to go from awkward to just plain weird and wrong. Its soap opera-esque qualities could be expected to be found in any trashy, run-of-the-mill vampire/sci-fi paperback- not our beloved Twilight Series! In the story's narration, it was almost a relief to get into Jacob Black's semi-normal werewolf brain, as opposed to idling in Edward-Bella Impossible/Odd Conflict Land. The return to Bella's point of view is slightly more grounded, but unrelatable, predictable, and... just weird. Not even her long-awaited transformation can make up for the cheesy, random events that any amateur fan fiction writer could have cooked up.When I waited in line at my local bookstore, counting down the seconds until I could hold this book in my hands, I was expecting, if not a masterpiece, at least something equivalent to its predecessors. What I got instead was a total whirlwhind of "WHAT?"s and "Are you serious?"es. Yes, Ms. Meyer may claim that this is the finish always intended for Edward and Bella. But, to be honest, I kind of wish she'd have just kept this ending to herself and left us hanging with realistic, relatable, satisfying decisions made in Eclipse. One can't help but wonder if the only reason Meyer wrote what she wrote was to keep from avoiding any cliches or "boring" expectations. If that was the case, I wish her a congratulations. We're not bored, but we are totally confused, weirded out, and miffed.Readers are, at least, spared an unfinished or depressing ending. Sighs of relief are allowable. However, I almost would have rather had a few more sufferings if it meant that the ending of this book were as thematic, inspiring, and downwright sophisticated as the denoument of this saga could and should have been.</review>

<review id="8644">I cannot recommend it.  Mine crashes FAR to often.It just locks up, and you aren't sure if it is the internet which is slow or what.  Luckily I have some computers connected to a different switch which run fine and fast on the network, even when this thing is crashing.Maybe I have a bad unit, i need to call netgear and try an RMA, but I wanted to share my unfortunate experience.Also drawbacks:  no syslog for logging, no snmp for information.    It really don't have any concept of running as an bridge AP and not a router.  don't most of these wireless routers have bridge functionality for if I already have a router?above was may 23, 2006... update august 26, 2006:After using the latest flash about a month ago, the router is far more stable.  for the price, I think it is worth it.</review>

<review id="8648">I have purchased three of these 2nd generation shuffles.  All three have had the same, exact problem, and none of them work, even though I've only owned them a month.  I bought them for myself and my two kids.  They worked at first, but upon charging, updating software, and adding songs, they inevitably had some sort of software problem and quit working.  I searched Apple's support area, and although I've now spent countless hours trying to fix my particular problem, I have been unable to even find the problem listed on Apple's website, and I am unable to actually speak to a human being about the issue.  I will NEVER buy an Apple product again.  They have lost me forever.</review>

<review id="8651">Retracting print charges is NOT ENOUGH.  TurboTax needs to get out of bed with the IRS.  For 2008 TurboTax places blue and red TARNISHING IMPRINTS across many of your printouts.  The TARNISHING IMPRINTS are to assist IRS's goal (not consumer's goal) of unnecessarily forcing toward eFiling and to assist IRS's goal (not consumer's goal) of disallowing unanswered questions etc, that consumers often prefer to bypass, and IRS dislikes.  The TARNISHING IMPRINTS also appear when forms are printed singly, instead of the full return.  Stop immediately.         Consumers must have the right to fill out forms the way they choose and to print forms independently, not necessarily in tandem -- just like getting IRS forms and using pen & ink.  Therefore TurboTax's mere retracting its per print charge is NOT sufficient to correct this.  TurboTax will not redeem its error, until it completely disables those blue and red TARNISHING IMPRINTS.  They're like going into court with an orange prison jump suit, on your tax return.      Several reviewers erroneously suggest that doing taxes for others is like spreading the same copy of MS Windows around.  ABSOLUTELY NOT, its like installing Windows and MS Office on ONE computer, but paying TurboTax for it over and over, each calendar year.  Then printing business letters to the IRS, on behalf of several different people, from your ONE legal copy of MS Office.  It's the output of the program that's spread, not the program itself.  There never was anything illegal about that.       A sage reminder to Intuit:  Since the inception of computers, it's only acceptable to tamper with customers' print capability --in free DEMO software --not when customers pay full price. Nothing is so central to a valid software, than its printing.  Remember the blue and red TARNISHING IMPRINTS continue to interfere with our ability to print what we wish.      Don't even think of buying, till TurboTax complies.  Instead use last years software to rough out taxes -- then finalize by hand on totally legal, 2008 paper IRS forms (or free IRS downloads).   Save your money.  Don't fall for advertising that they're on your side.   Sadly, TurboTax seems to have become the corporate handmaiden of IRS.</review>

<review id="8652">Office 2007 is a pretty big leap from the previous versions, which can be nice for newer users, but the attempt to make things easier tends to make things harder for those of use who are used to a more classic system. If you're strapped for cash or just don't want to spend $70-$150 just to do some spreadsheets, word documents, powerpoint presentations, etc. there's always openoffice. This is a decent product, but I'm always surprised at how few people know of the free, open source alternatives. There's also Abiword if you just want a word processor.</review>

<review id="8653">The PC version of Quicken 2007 is very strong, but very few of those features have been pulled into the Mac version. I use an Intel MacBook, and this program crashed it with regularity. The auto categorization feature is often wrong. As other reviewers have noted the shortcuts often don't work. With so much wrong with this product, I find it difficult to trust the numbers it generates, and thus is worthless to me.Do not buy this product.</review>

<review id="8654">I purchased this unit several months ago and it failed within 60 days (while still under warranty). It simply sat under my desk and died one day for no apparent reason. Incredibly, Iomega will not recover the data unless I pay a very high fee (around $1000+). The drive only cost a tenth of that - its the data that I want not a new drive! I guess they don't care once they have your money.</review>

<review id="8655">This was "drivvle". I was looking for a mature story with thrills and spills. Instead, this was tiresome. It deserved a stronger 3D characterisation on all key characters, especially the 'triangle' of Bella, Edward and Jacob. To be honest, the thing I liked most, was the cover, and the series of covers for the trilogy, or book series.Other disappointments include the repetitious elements of dialogue, plotline, emotions and description.I'm 24, and no longer a teenager but there are better examples of driving teen drama books that cover romance, vampires, thrills, and love triangle.Skip this book and don't be sucked in by the cover!P.S. A redeeming feature - no exposition of previous plotlines - something I enjoyed too.</review>

<review id="8656">I searched all the reviews from the Technologically savvy to the just connect it and get ready people to make my decision to buy this product. During the collapse of a big box giant(CC)tear..., I decided to buy this product and have been headached ever since. The very first time I set up the software, it worked great on a PC and on an older Mac. I installed the proprietary software onto the PC, because my MAC was not supported. Both computers were desired to run wirelessly, and both to this day have issues daily. The main reason I shelled out the top $$ for this unit is because I read reviews about the coverage area. Living in the bayarea, the heart of silcon valley CA, I have great upload and download speeds via my cable connection. Which is provided by a very inexpensive cable router from ... not Motorola, but RCARCA DCM425 DIGITAL CABLE MODEM (RCA DCM425). The setup disk allows the user to go into settings without typing in the ISP to access the router. The issue that I have is that the lower bandwidth will be almost non-existent for hours at a time within a 3 foot range and a clear view. The signal is very weak and it drops the connection very frequently. Previously I had a non dual band wireless modem from linksys... Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router, and that worked amazingly on 3 laptops, a PS3, and a desktop... all operating optimally wireless. Since I had such a great experiance about the ease of use of the old linksys product, when I left my old place with roomates, I decided to upgrade. Bad idea on my part. If you dedicate higher transfer speeds on the higher bandwidth, then going wireless on the 2.4Ghz bandwidth is like dial up with horrible range and dropped connections. I have no lower bandwidth upstairs in my home and constant dropping on the 5.0Ghz with my PC which is able to recieve these signals.If you are spending more than $80, which I did, then don't buy this item. Save your money and buy a wireless system at a much more inexpensive price. The router listed above is for the plug and play person like me, while the WRT610N is over priced and lacking dumbease compatible. If you are technologically and multimedia savvy, don't dismiss the lack for automatic connections which are not user friendly on this device. I have a 52" TV, PS3, Blueray player, and a multiroom reciever connected via DLNA ethernet connections which also speak through the network... which when speaking with the wireless computers have issues unless I reset connections on a daily basis with this router. Such a pain. When wired, it works ok but takes a moment to talk. I had my friend come by to trouble shoot it, who maintains the network system of a local company who in turned off the lower bandwidth which improved the speed ever so slightly but now disabled the MAC. We undid his tinkering and have just been frustrated ever since. I tried to call tech support which left me on hold for hours with no help nad have decided to give this 1 star on price and 1 star on use. Over all is 1 star, so much more reliable routers from linksys that can be picked up for a fraction of the price.</review>

<review id="8658">I was so looking forward to the conclusion of the Twilight series, but this was a letdown. Not a small letdown, which I could have easily forgiven, but a HUGE letdown. I don't know where to begin. This story takes so many strange turns. The plot becomes a confusing, horrible mess. Stephenie tries to make all of these neat little ties to fit in her happy endings. I'm all for happy endings, but the way she tries to get there is overly explained and too complicated, not to mention bizarre in some cases. It's like she's trying too hard to make everything work, and it doesn't. This story should have concentrated more on Bella and Edward's relationship, but that becomes almost a side story taken care of early on in the book. It's like she was getting ahead of herself. Trying to fit the epilogue in, when we all wanted a juicy finale. Everything happens much too conveniently and the anticlimactic scene that's tantalizingly hinted at ends up being rather quiet and boring. Bottom line - Bella gets to have her cake and eat it too, but in a plot that's too busy and strange.</review>

<review id="8659">I bought Iomega 160 GB to use it mainly for back-up. Following the instructions coming with the product, I connected it to my laptops (IBM and SONY) as well as my desktop (DELL) but none of those could actually see it. I visited Iomega website to get some extra info but I didn't find any new information that could resolve this issue. However, it was not supposed to be that complicated connecting an external hard drive with your laptop/desktop through USB. Anyway, I couldn't figure out what is going on and I just sent it back to amazon. I bought the Western Digital 250 GB instead, and I am extremely happy. It is even smaller than Iomega and very reliable. I backed up my laptops and my desktop as easily as it should be.</review>

<review id="8664">I purchased this exact same unit from QVC (at a much higher price), and it didn't work. Since then, QVC has discontinued selling this product. Very disappointed, since this seemed like an easy answer to transferring data from my old PC to the new one.</review>

<review id="8665">I bought this device about a week ago and have had a lot of issues since then. This product is NOT ready for public use!I left the drive on overnight and then I could not turn it off using the remote! I hard to keep the power button on the drive pressed for about 10 seconds to shut it down. It has hung up on me atleast 2 times in the past 3-4 days. This issue is in addition to the following issues I've had with the pro HD 1) wifi USB does not work with WEP or unsecure SSIDs. 2) ability to browse the shared folders on your PC is not guaranteed. You have to try couple of times and if you are lucky you will see your PC. 3) for *.mov extensions it plays the video but not the audio. 4) when connected to my HD TV through an HDMI cable it chooses 480p instead of "auto hdmi" as the video output. 5) Cannot transfer files > 2GB over the network. 6) Remote and the UI in general are very very user unfriendly. You have to point the remote directly at the device for it to respond. 7) Using the soft keyboard to enter username/password is a nightmare. If you have a long username/password then best of luck entering that!  divx VoD *does not work*. This is a pure and simple breach of contract as the device claims to be "divx" certified. 9) cannot map the Iomega to drives on two PCs. If you want it mapped on the second one then you have to disconnect it from the 1st PC.10) Transferring 1 GB of data is a very very slow process (close to 10 mins).</review>

<review id="8666">Although this product was expensive, the reviews were great so we thought we should give it a try. After 3 months I see no improvement at all. Sure, if you cut off the stained hair the new hair is lighter - for awhile- and then the stains come back even while continuing Angel Eyes.

<review id="8670">This is a relatively inexpensive coffee maker...and as the old saying goes, "you get what you pay for."The lid for the coffee pot attaches by way of two little posts on the pot which, over time, will most definitely break, as you have to take the lid off to clean the pot.  Bad design!The bright light on the display is an eye sore.  I have a beautiful kitchen, but this bright light says "look at me - the ugly coffee maker in the corner."  I don't need to see what time my coffee maker says it is from the other side of the room.If you walk away while the coffee is brewing, you have know way to know if it's done.  There's no beep or any sort of notice that your pot is ready.  So don't go too far or start doing something else while your pot is brewing - or you might forget to check to see when it's done.My biggest gripe with this coffee maker is the fact that it takes A LOT more coffee to make a pot of equal strength compared to my previous coffee maker.  So much so, that I've gotten my old coffee maker out of the basement and this one is now sitting on the shelf.  So although this coffee maker is relatively inexpensive, the extra money I would have to spend over time on coffee makes this a rather expensive - and poorly designed - coffee maker.</review>

<review id="8672">This is a bad company.  I purchased a wireless router from them and, truth be told, it never really worked right.  The speed was ok, but it was impossible to set up without tech support and every so often it would simply stop working.  When that happened I would be forced to call tech support and spend 30-60 minutes on the phone fighting with them about resetting the router.  I recently purchased a new computer and decided to save a little money by moving this router to it.  When I called tech support I was told that the router was out of its warranty period and they could not help me... unless I would pay them to.  That's right, I would have to pay for the assistance on their product - a working product because it was not under warranty.  So be warned that you are only buying the option to use Linksys' products for a limited time - that is if you have any problems whatsoever that require tech support.  I am now trying a Trendnet.  Let's see if they are any better.</review>

<review id="8673">We were so eager to receive this camera in the mail so that we could wrap it as a Christmas gift for someone in our family.  The product, as presented on the FLIP website, seemed so perfect, the delivery sooooo simple, the results sooooo clean and easy to create!  Everything seemed impossibly easy to do.  Even the website "sample" videos were to die for, but yet seemed so spontaneous!    Well, Christmas came and went -- with a variety of issues that caused us, at times, to throw our hands-up into the air and wonder if any product could deliver more poorly than this camera.  There are many problems with the flip camera.  Pure Digital has only delivered issues, not solutions.    No kidding -- this product was launched with an IMMEDIATE NEED for a software "patch" to fix the issues with the camera.  We have lost several videos, spent hours trying to make the "upgraded" software from the FLIP site work (which it still doesn't).  As far as I am concerned, the developers of this product launched it too quickly, trying to capitalize upon the Christmas sales, but without an answer for the HOST of compatability issues between this product and a PC.  How irresponsible!!  I am personally capable on a PC, and could not get this thing to work properly using their materials.  Sure, eventually SOME of the camera features work -- but we have lost several videos from our family Christmas, can't create or save the movies using their "built-in" software (which you still must try and somehow install on your computer -- deceptive!), and basically could get better functionality from one of the disposable video cameras that are on the market now!  The support line will call you back and/or answer the phone, but they have no answers for compatability problems with their software and a PC.  One silver lining that we have discovered -- it is possible to work with some of the material that you record using Windows Movie Maker.  But it is a more complex package than what the manufacturer claims to have developed in their camera.  Don't waste your money.  Don't take any videos of value with this camera --  you might lose them.  Spend less money and get a disposable.</review>

<review id="8677">This review is from: Pinocchio (Disney Gold Classic Collection) (DVD)      if you honestly, seriously, loved your kid, and wanted him to be safe and not expose him to innappropriate stuff, this should not be shown to him. This DVD/VHS is chock full of useless stupid nonsense that I never liked. I think that if you wanted to watch something educational, watch some presidential speech.. or rugrats.. none of these new age cartoons or old age cartoons such as this. " i want to be a real boy ". Well, for one you can't talk in real life, and, nobody loves you enough for oyu to be real. This video was never one of my favorites, but instead i've always hated it in heart. If I could put a penny on every stupid line said in this movie, I would be richer than mr.gates. This thing has horrible acting, unbelievable bad singing, and it hurts me to watch it.. knowing that people actually encourage kids to watch this. I for one think if blood and groteskness is innappropriate for their kids, this is much much worse. This and the little mermaid.. basically really all the older disney films. If you other people can recall, on the old L.M. VHS box, there was a ..Long... golden.. figure in the background of the castle. Remember? That just shows how uncalled for this is, and how all this money thats being made is going tot he wrong people..... over at disney..Avoid this film, and L.M. at all costs!Sincerely from the heart of,Me.Alex.</review>

<review id="8679">I really wanted to like this machine, I thought DeLonghi had given us an affordable pump-drive cappuccino maker. And it just isn't quite.(n.b. I'm trying to get customer images up. If the technical difficulty goes away please refer to my customer images for visual reference.)Things to like:1. Pump drive! So much better than steam pressure machines. It works pretty well too.2. The espresso comes out very good (though in small amounts, see below). All 3 proper layers are discernable, crema is especially satisfactory.3. The removable tank is very handy. And large.4. Price is right, I don't think there's a more affordable machine with such quality performance "guts".These pluses are solid reasons to own this machine.Why I am returning it:1. The holder for espresso grounds is WAY too small. There are two of them and the bigger one is less than half the size of any standard equipment. Unless you only ever plan to pull 2oz at a time the espresso will come out weak. I usually pull 2-3 shots minimum and can't be bothered to pull, empty, and tamp for every 2 oz I want.2. The frother is so low to the counter that even a small frothing pitcher won't fit under it. Boo.3. The wand is so shallow that I cannot properly froth any decent amount of milk since the wand only goes down into the very top of the milk. Also boo. I can't make milk stretch with this gizmo and it's one of the reasons I picked this machine.4. The only thing that fits under the espresso spout is a shot glass or espresso cup. 2 inches of clearance offers no flexibility for pulling into a mug or small pitcher. I could have lived with this if 1-3 were not already problems.All of these issues, which I consider design flaws, could easily be corrected in a product redesign. The internal works are fine. A taller machine with a longer wand would fix all my problems. As is it takes too long to get coffee I don't want and there's always a clean-up mess.I started with a super-cheap steam drive machine and upgraded to this one expecting an affordable way to take my coffee production to the next level. This machine should be great and instead it's just frustrating.If you're only looking for a small shot in some modest foam and don't mind some hassle this is a fine machine. I regrettably will be looking for something else.</review>

<review id="8680">I made the mistake of buying all the first six seasons on DVD because I watched a few random inconsecutive episodes at someone else's house and thought that I'd like it since I normally like Superhero movies. I wish I'd never bought them. First of all, almost every single character on Smallville has ethical problems. Clark Kent is so determined to keep his powers secret that he becomes a compulsive liar and goes as far as to hurt all the people closest to him, including the love of his life, Lana Lang. Lana starts out in the earlier seasons as a character who is more honest and sincere than Clark, and by season six she turns into the money grubbing opportunistic and shallow wife of evil sadist Lex Luthor. Lex starts out the earlier seasons trying to be good, and is initally Clark Kent's best freind. Clark's freindship with Lex frequently compromises his moral judgement and often the so-called "hero" Clark even goes as far as engaging in actions that empower Lex and his father Lionel to do evil things, and the worst part is, he knows it but claims it's not his place to stop Lex or his father from the broader evil agenda they have- but rather only intervene in indivdual acts of evil without addressing Lex and Lionel's broader pattern of behavior or the threat thier actions have to society at large. Lionel Luther at one point captures Clark Kent and puts him in a tub of liquid kryptonite, at another point hires a mobster to take Clark and his entire family hostage- and yet Martha Kent finds it in her heart not only to forgive Lionel for these things in later episodes- but to go beyond that and have an affair with him after her husband Jonathan dies of a heart attack that takes place as a direct result of a conversation with guess who? Lionel. Virtually all of the characters of Smallville at some point in time do something evil- even the so-called "good guys", which makes it a bad show in my opinion. A superhero show is supposed to be designed to teach the audience the difference between right and wrong. Smallville does not accomplish that goal. Clark's lies alienate not only Lana, but they seem to be part of the series of events that turns Lex Luthor from a person who wants to be a good person but tends to fail in that goal, to a person who chooses not to be good and revels in his evil. From watching all the first six seasons this transition from a "morally challenged" Lex to a downright evil and sadistic Lex unravels simultaneously as the trust between Clark and Lex unravels. Lex lies to Clark for years as he has Clark investigated, followed, and practically stalked. But throughout the series it is apparent that Clark is as much to blame for this as Lex since, if they were supposedly true freinds at any point, Clark could have been honest with Lex, Chloe, Lana, and his other inner circle friends and then none of them would have had anything to wonder about in the first place. So it's clear that although Lex is definitely the most evil character in the series, Clark has almost as much culpability in Lex's evolution into an evil character as Lex's father, Lionel has for his role in turning his son into a monster. Lionel of course is the person who taught Lex to be ruthless and vengeful, and though in later episodes he seems at points to be regretful of that, he never really does much to change Lex's direction in life, other than to occasionally help people who are trying to stop Lex from doing evil things. But it would have been better if Lionel could've just convinced Lex to stop being evil or done whatever it took to neutralize Lex if changing Lex was impossible. One of the more ludicrous moments in the show is when Clark faces an evil alien plant-woman who escaped from a prison planet she'd been sent to by Jor-El because she had destroyed entire planets. After she tells Clark her goal is to wipe out the human race and all civilization as we know it- Clark politely asks her to leave Earth voluntarily. Of course she refuses and the fight with Clark that ensues leads to her demise, but what made that scene so ridiculous is that the alien plant woman had already murdered innocent people and expressed her intention to destroy the earth- and Clark thought politely asking her to leave would get to her to go away voluntarily. There is a big difference between innocent naivety and blatant stupidity. Clark has lots of moments like these in Smallville, and often those moments work to the advantage of Lex Luthor and some of the other villians who emerge in the show. Instead of developing a Superman character people can respect and admire, Smallville portrays Superman as a selfish liar whose choices frequently lead to disasters. Many of his so-called heroics are in the context of cleaning up situations of his own making, and though he is willing to put himself at risk at times to help people, he makes protecting his secret identity as important a priority as saving lives. I'm sorry, but Spiderman puts saving people first, even ahead of protecting his identity. That is what a superhero should do, and the Clark Kent of Smallville is nowhere near as selfless as Spider Man (going by the Spider Man movies since I've never read the comics). In Spider Man 2, Spider Man allows his identity to be seen by an entire subway car full of people in order to save their lives- but after watching 6 seasons of Smallville, I don't think the Smallville Clark Kent would do the same. Which makes the series Smallville a total dissapointment. I would not reccomend watching this series because the disappointing choices made by its characters show only that NONE of them know the difference between right and wrong, and NONE of them are as selfless as the superheroes we expect in movies or comics. It's one thing for a superhero to be flawed, and to sometimes make mistakes. But on Smallville, everyone from Clark Kent and his family to Lex Luthor and his family is not just flawed- they all have a very warped sense of what justice is and what their obligatons to their loved ones as well as the world around them are. I grew up on old-school superhero cartoons in the 80s where all the "good guys" really had something to teach the audience about the difference between right and wrong, and I've come to expect the superhero genre to do that, and this show doesn't do that. All of the characters are as deceptive as any soap opera, so this show is I guess, more of a soap opera, than a superhero show.</review>

<review id="8681">this will work "VERY" well for 1 or 2 weeks...then it will stop working, or sometimes stop your pc.you will see on this review pages, "Great item" "Great gizmo" "Great buy"...those "Great" series appears massively on 12th or 13th of March.

<review id="8682">Unlike some other reviews here, my experience was not favorable. I was only able to get it work with 2 of our 5 home office computers, even when used with supposedly matching Linksys draft N adaptors. Wasted most of a day trying different suggestions from Linksys web site - which was basically a listing of users helping users! I've been setting up my own networks for many years and this was one of the most frustrating products I've tried. I returned this router and went back to an old reliable (5 years+) Linksys access point connected to a wired Vonage router.</review>

<review id="8683">Fifty-three minutes. That's how long it takes for the Richard Gere and Diane Lane characters to have their first Hollywood-style kiss in this plodding, teary-eyed 2008 soap opera based on Nicholas Sparks' successful 2002 novel...and only after a life-threatening hurricane throws them in each other's arms. Like the other adaptations of his work - Message in a Bottle, A Walk to Remember, The Notebook - it is tastefully produced with a swooning sense of romanticism and a fantasy-laden sense of character and situation. The themes are also familiar to anyone who has seen the other films since the focus is on two tortured souls who meet fortuitously, transform each other, and face some unexpected tragedy to reinforce the eternity of their love.If it sounds formulaic, it is with every major scene turning into some life lesson for some character. There is a long line of these sudsy melodramas - The Prince of Tides, The Bridges of Madison County and The Lake House come to mind - but the difference is that first-time big-screen director George C. Wolfe does not do anything to enhance the formula despite the stellar work he has done on Broadway with "Angels in America". Adapted by TV-movie veterans Ann Peacock and John Romano, the story starts with recent divorcee Adrienne Willis agreeing to watch her best friend Jean's B&B, a precarious-looking oceanfront property in the picturesque hamlet of Rodanthe in North Carolina's Outer Banks. Not only is she doing a vacationing Jean a favor, but she can also avoid her unfaithful ex-husband, a weekend dad who is becoming increasingly persistent about coming back to the family.It's late in the vacation season and a hurricane is brewing, but the inn still has one reservation, a guest willing to pay double the rate to keep it open. The guest is Dr. Paul Flanner, a moody plastic surgeon who has come to Rodanthe from Raleigh to face the widower of a patient who died on his operating table. While it appears he is trying to avoid a malpractice suit, he also has family issues with an estranged son who has followed his father into the medical profession but decided to help the poor in Ecuador instead. Adrienne and Paul naturally follow the pattern of their damaged souls, and the rest is inevitable. In their third onscreen coupling, Gere and Lane are on familiar territory here, and while they perform capably, neither brings anything terribly new to the story. In fact, Lane's performance feels very much a carbon copy of her work in Under the Tuscan Sun.The surprise is the caliber of actors that the producers have been able to recruit to fill the minor parts. Currently wowing critics as Mrs. Miller in Doubt, an almost unrecognizable Viola Davis is relegated to sassy best friend as Jean, while a taciturn Scott Glenn and an uncredited James Franco show up as the emotionally wounded widower and Paul's son Mark, respectively. It's a shame none of them are given material worthy of their talent. Instead, we are given a big-budget Lifetime TV-movie that moves glacially until a hectic montage of letters leads to the unsurprising resolution. The bare-bones 2009 DVD offers no extras other than full-screen and wide-screen versions on opposite sides of the disc.</review>

<review id="8685">This product was not what I expected. They have changed the pusher to a plastic model which is not as effective as the wooden one shown in the photo.

<review id="8689">I've had this router for two months and had nothing but problems.  It randomly looses it's ip connection to my cable modem and then takes forever to find it again.

You're taking a risk buying this router.  I won't buy it again!</review>

<review id="8690">It's been a long time since I had to end a movie in less than a 1/2 hour of watching it.  In this case, I'm not sure if it even made it to 15 mins.

Appeared to be "Gone with the Wind" meets "Road Warrior". Awful!!</review>

<review id="8693">I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed. However, this product performed well below my expectation.The Achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music, or copy large files over the local network.  I use Apple iTunes to stream music to my stereo via the Linksys router.  Although it will work for a few minutes, it will eventually hang.  This behavior (hanging) also occurs when I transfer large files between my PCs.  After some research on the Net, I discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current WRT54G design (WRT54G, version 3, which Amazon currently sells).If you just use the router to surf the web, this router should serve your needs.  As I mentioned in my first paragraph, it supports WPA security, which is far superior to WEP.  In addition it is very easy to setup.I wanted to rate the router higher than 1 star, due to its security, easy of use, etc.  However, since it is not being able to perform its core function adequately, it doesn't deserve any higher.  The reader can find a better product with the competition and at a lower cost.</review>

<review id="8694">I am terribly unhappy with this gate.  The two features I was excited about proved to be worthless: the gate can't really be hardware-mounted and the self-closing door never closed without extra fiddling (instead, the door just bangs--very loudly--against the door frame).NOT HARDWARE-MOUNTED GATESA hardware-mounted gate is one where the gate itself is mounted to a structural part of the house (a wall, for instance).  This gate cannot be mounted in this fashion, despite what the manufacturer says.  Instead, you screw little "mounting cups" (1/4"-inch-deep plastic things) onto the wall and then pressure-mount the gate into the cups the same way you'd pressure-mount the gate into a doorway.  If your child can push a pressure-mounted gate down, the mounting cups are not much more of an obstacle.I'm returning this gate and never buying another Summer Infant product.  I can't afford to have my 8-month-old son tumbling down the stairs because of a product that doesn't perform the way it was advertised.</review>

<review id="8698">I wouldn't recommend this router unless you enjoy spending lots of time talking to customer support representatives.

<review id="8699">Is it just me, or am I the only person out there who is mildly revolted with the thinly-disguised Mormon ethos present in all of Meyers' works?I read these books because, as an illustrator, I want to know what's going on in the teen lit world, and anytime somebody gets labeled something histrionic ('The Next J.K. Rowling'), I'm curious. Unquestionably, this author has worked very hard to crank out some seriously long novels that are seriously packed with - well, not really plot, or action, and a great deal of thin, meandering dialogue - so I'm not quite sure what's in each book, but I do not doubt for one second that the passion of her romance writing is bizarrely gripping. I read all three of these books faster than whatever book I last read in the airport, and that's saying something. What does it say? Well, she certainly knows how to move at a literary clip.What does astonish me are the swarms of fans comparing her to Jane Austen (!!) and the utterly irresponsible path the books have taken in embracing what I presume to be a Mormon dictate: get married right out of high school, education is secondary to marriage and love, and never, ever stand up for yourself in front of a man. Women in the church are still subjugated no matter how liberated they may think they are, and this truism is decidedly present in the so-called arc her protagonist takes.I am also amazed that the author herself can state that her religion defines everything she writes, and yet nobody seems to mind - or know - that these teen romances are then 'defined' by it. They aren't only for sale in Christian bookstores, are they?I'm always glad when young people get excited to read. I love the statistic about juvenile crime dropping on the days when Harry Potter books are released to the public. How can that not be to the good? But why on earth do young women have to be spoon-fed the idea that sitting around and waiting for a boy to sweep them away is how their life should be defined? It makes me sad that packaging up that notion in a glossy cover fools girls into thinking it's not only great literature, but what they should strive for.EDIT: I am gratified to have gotten repeated comments on this review, regardless of negativity. I am also gratified for my judgments to have been corroborated by the author herself in the conclusion to this series, 'Breaking Dawn.' Therefore, my assessment of the subtext was correct.</review>

<review id="8700">I bought this item 2 months ago. When I first got it, it gave trouble to go on; once I unplugged it, I had to keep pressing the reset button on the plug to get it to work, or switching it to another socket. Looking back, the message on the plug that read "Press reset button if not turn on" should have been a warning sign (not even proper English), but I didn't worry, because it always went on in the end. Well, that was until a few days ago. No matter how many times I press the reset button, my CHI "not turn on". I called Amazon, but of course the 30 days had expired (forget the warranty)! They did offer 80% back, however. Of course I have to pay for shipping and hope that it gets back to them. I figure that's better than nothing, but i am NOT reordering another one from this website.</review>

<review id="8701">I can't even download the software. When I first tried downloading it, it went beyond 100% and never finished downloading. I used Amazon's "Call Me" feature and I received an automated message saying that they were only available during certain hours and I had to call back. I tried this at 11am and 1pm pacific time. Then I tried calling the regular Amazon support number and I spoke to two people who literaly did not understand English enough to look up my order. This has been a very frustrating experience. I will never buy digital software from Amazon again. It is now four days after my purchase and I still can't even download it.</review>

<review id="8702">The product is mediocre on a good day.  Support is non-existent.

So, if you are foolish, you start all over.  I did not.</review>

<review id="8705">had this for a month now. Worked great at first, then the power button would not stop blinking (means no-go) so a reset would work... for a week.  Then it got worse!  I would have hold down the reset button (with the tip of a pen) and unplug it... it works great!  ...but for only a day or two.  I would then have to play the reset button / unpluging the unit game for 5 or ten times before it would work!  Then, this game would not work anymore (after three days).  O.K., called Linksys... talked to someone in India, they had a &quot;Quick fix&quot;, I say this because they changed my network connection settings and it worked for about two days... now its back to the same game... blinking power light.  Called linsys again... talked to someone in India... line gets disconnected after 25 minutes of being on hold...;  How hard is it to make a router that works!?!  To sum it up:  Tech support: 3 out of 10.  Product:  3 out of 10.  Satisfaction -3 out of 10!  Whats the deal?  I spend $100 on a router (a router of all things!) and I expect it to work... no go!

The drive worked fine, but after about 6 months of light use and careful handling, the USB connector came loose and fell off. I tried to reseat it, but no go. Also, I think all such drives ought to have a capless design, or at least have the cap fit the end, like a pen cap does. I've also seen some that are tied to the device. A cap is just too easy to lose. However, I must admit--leaving the cap in a visible location helped me to not forget and leave the drive in my school computer.</review>

<review id="8715">LIKED THE STYLE, AND HAVE BOUGT 2. . .BOTH FAILED WITHIN A YEAR</review>

<review id="8716">This review is from: Rachel Getting Married [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)      The hand held camera work was so overdone that the two of us got physically nauseated. This was unnecessary and frankly I felt I was being manipulated into feeling, "you dummy, in case you don't get it this film is being artistic." But it was faux artistic. Bergman or any good director could have made his points without nauseating his audience. There were nice bits of world music in the background, but they wove into the emotional chaos and camera jiggles in ways such that I could not even enjoy them and they became simply annoying noise in a way. I think that added to the nausea. So much for cinematic techniques from decades past that were overdone and not well done. How about the acting? Well my friend and I disagreed mildly. I thought it was often okay, my friend thought it was clumsy and mostly only made an impression because the emotional carnage was intense, not because there was much subtly. How about the story itself? Dysfunctional liberal Jewish family joining with a black family and all hell breaks loose? Well all sorts of families can be dysfunctional. The strong play-up of the ethnicity of the characters did not seem essential to the story. It was a sort of cheap hook that did give atmosphere but that ended up being more a distraction than informative. Again, plenty of distractions here -- hand held camera, noisy background, ethnicity. Where is the meat? Another film about dysfunctional families and personalities.  Did we learn anything new about dysfunctional families? Some people can't get enough, and it is not bad to be reminded how messed up families can get, and how a lot of c@&%p can rise to the surface during holidays and family celebrations. Yes indeed it can! Some people do need examples to help remind them of this. Maybe this was the target audience. Much of the emotional blood and guts did ring true, but it seemed overdone. This is not to say false exactly, but in the sense of "if you did not get it in the last scene, I will hold your nose in it in another and another and another." Some would say "powerful" but I would say "nothing subtle."  I guess I think that the first few films that I saw that dealt with dysfunction, drugs, etc were useful, regardless of their quality. Maybe in fairness I have just seen too many and need to see some new angle to not be bored by these time honored themes. But in my considered opinion these themes have been and can be developed much better artistically in terms of story line, and certainly in terms of film technique. But hey! -- we are all different. I am the 6th reviewer and this film did get through to the previous 5 with high marks. I also saw 20 some positive reviews on the internet before I watched this film. Maybe this is all new for a lot of people and this film can help them to think about it. What can I say?  All I can say is that if you are one who gets sea-sick easily then be warned and take Dramamine if you are determined to watch this. If you admire the ways in which directors like Bergman, Preminger, Wilder, Lumet, Allen, or hey any number of directors have dealt with dysfunctions and addictions and recovery attempts and family events turned into carnage then be warned that this film may not add much new to these topics. If I have warned you off of this film, well don't be sad. There are a lot of really good art films out there, as well as very entertaining cheap comedies and horror films and even many "mainstream Hollywood films." And if dysfunction is your thing just Google something like "alcoholism in film" or etc. and I think you can pick out a lot of interesting films that will not make you sea-sick and that are not cluttered and pseudo-artsy.</review>

<review id="8717">I read a number of reviews from people who were disappointed in the color of the sheets when they received them.  Since I was ordering white, I didn't think that would be an issue.  I was wrong.  The photo showed a bright, clean white.  When I opened the box and saw the sheets, I immediately checked the color on the label because I assumed they sent me the wrong color.  They were, at best, a cream color.  When I held them against actual white pillow cases, they just looked dingy.  I was very disappointed and returned the sheets.</review>

<review id="8718">I have used pretty much every version of MS Project there has been over the last 10 years.  This is the first version that I have had problems with.  First, let me talk about the good.  This really does help with visualization of projects.  Especially when making changes to an existing project.  I really like that when you make a change it shows you the effects on other items.Now the bad, printing schedules is broken.  Anytime you change the scale, things look really bad.  Text gets cut off and task bars don't scale propertly.  I have corrsponded on MS forums and they agree that scaling doesn't work well.  For me, this is a deal breaker.I have also had problems with Project changing the constraint types on some pretty complex projects.  This is simple enough to fix if you notice it, but it is truely annoying.I have had none of these problems with MS Project 2003 and I still prefer MS Project to other scheduling options on the market.Basically, I recommend buying Project 2003, at least until they work the bugs out of this one.</review>

BUT then when you have to physically clean it with Soap and water and it's a mess.  TOO many parts.  The litter area is too small for even a medium size cat to fit in.

What is doesn't say is that it doesn't work on this particular game .I am supposed to have figured that out before I bought the wretched thing.Now I could get the MacAlly ishock II which will work with my G4 but when I upgrade to an intel it will be useless.

<review id="8725">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      Transformers was a big disappointment. Sure, the effects are great, but that's it. Supposedly no one sees a Michael Bay film for its excellence, but why not? Why can't a movie that spent this much  money be smart and funny, not trite and oversexed? The film totally objectified the main woman lead, and besides that, everything about the plot was shallow. Transformers is a ridiculously over-hyped and mediocre film.</review>

<review id="8729">I had used Dragon 6.0 and liked it.  My computer died and I had to get a new one.  Unfortunatly, they only come with Microsoft Vista now.  So I had to buy a new version of Dragon for my new computer.  I could not install it because if gave me Error 1330.  I looked up the solution to error 1330, which is Tech Note 6042 and followed both solutions, but they did not work.  It seemed to work until I tried to use the program and it had me install a vocabulary file when I created a user profile, but the vocabulary file never installed and again I got error 1330.  I tried to contact technical support, but I would have to pay $20 per incident.  They do give you one free technical support call, but I didn't feel like using that up just to install the program.  I looked at many technical support discussion websites about error 1330 and there are lots of angry people out there who have gotten this very same error and have Vista.   It seems like Nuance, the makers of Dragon, do not stand behind their product and have made one heck of a lemon with version 10.  I recommend looking else where for voice to text program, unless you still have Windows XP or lower.  I tried out the speach recognition program that comes with Microsoft Vista and it works fine, I am sticking with that, it is already installed and its free.  Just go to "start" "settings" "control panel" "speech recognition" open it, take the tutorial and train it once or twice and your off.  Don't bother with Dragon NS.</review>

<review id="8730">It seems everyone knows this "Secret" is not a secret. So the DVD and book lie from the outset. It was never suppressed. There is no proof offered that the famous people who knew the "secret" actually knew it.It's a repackaged version of the Book "The Power of Positive Thinking. Positive thinking is a good way to feel happy and confident. It helps to accomplish your goals. This book says you don't have to work you only have to think in the correct, positive way and then want you want will somehow arrive.It says Isaac Newton knew the secret. And for those of you who aren't aware of the premise the secret is the "Law of Attraction"But Newton formulated something different,The law of universal attractionThis was identified by Newton as a force acting upon any two bodies in the Universe, Called the law of universal attraction or gravity.The law that an object will fall to the ground or the moon is held in place by a larger object; the Earth. It wasn't about getting necklaces.Having people give you an expensive necklace is one of the things the DVD shows are attainable if you use their Law of Attraction.Here's the central premise of the Secret so those of you out there don't have to spend money on this.The law of attraction that is mentioned in the book and DVD is; if you have positive thoughts about wanting things or health or love then those things will come to you.Ask, Believe, Receive are the key to getting what you want.On one hand the DVD "experts" (since the creator of the movie found experts that is more proof there is no secret.) say that the law of attraction works whether you believe in it or not. But with Ask, Believe, Receive it states you have to BELIEVE for it to work. That is the way out for most spiritual con artists. If their predictions are wrong or their advice doesn't work it is your fault.The DVD also warns that if you think negatively than those bad things will happen to you. One example in the movie is a person in their car who does not want to be late. He thinks I don't want to be late so that supposed negative thought radiates outside him and causes him to be stuck in traffic. I don't know about you but I have not wanted to be late many times and that was all that was on my mind.I either left early and wasn't late or I drove really fast and I wasn't late and I was late. There was no correlation between thought and result.The creator a Ms. Byrne a TV producer was not doing well financially or in her career when she read a book''The Science of Getting Rich,'' first published in 1910. No suppression of that book. She then read other non suppressed books in the same theme.So what did she do? Did she use the power of the secret to attract millions of dollars and attract wonderful TV projects to produce that would make her lots of money and fame? No she worked. She came up with and idea and wrote out a script, she sought out financing for the movie. She didn't wait until the financing was attracted to her. She sat down and wrote a book. She worked to get what she wanted.Ms. Byrne upended the whole idea of the Law of Attraction by going out and getting something instead of ASKING, BELIEVING AND RECEIVINGThen by clever marketing, she was able to expose the DVD to the public and enough people who look for the easy way in life purchased it. They were not attracted to blindly send her money. She provided a place to buy it. The book preaches magic but the creator practiced hard work and persistence and good old fashioned imagination to get her millions. The fact that her ideas are not worth buying but sold into the millions is a testament to those many people who don't want to work or develop their imagination. They want the get rich quick scheme. Or get love quick or get healthy quick scheme.Bottom line: The Secret is of no value as it can be summed up in a few phrases that have been openly spoken and written for ages.Think Positive about your life, Think about what you want to achieve. Visualize your goal or whatever accomplishment large or small you want to attain. Much like a Golfer sees his shot landing on the green before he hits the ball. Study, work and show initiative in order to gain that which you want. If you sit in your home waiting, nothing will happen. Of course you should also buy a lottery ticket now and then because somebody has to win.One last story about negative thinking, I wrote and performed in a play, at a small Toronto theatre. I financed it myself. I made the costumes and props and did most of the Publicity. We rehearsed and had some previews and then it was time for the night the critics came. For two weeks I was convinced the critics would hate it. I was able to visualize their faces in the audience looking grim, bored and angry they had showed up.It was irrational but those thoughts obsessed me. That Opening night was also the night the heat didn't work and it was 12 degrees outsideThe reviews came out the next week and it was a huge critical success. They all loved it! The play sold out for 8 months. So despite what the secret says, despite the law of attraction that works whether you believe it or not, I didn't attract bad reviews. I had worked very hard and despite my negativity and fear the play was a success.</review>

<review id="8732">First, I have to admit that I didn't realize this wasn't battery-powered when I bought this, so I was slightly disappointed when it came. (Note to Groom Mate (or any other manufacturer): Make one that is this small and sturdy that is battery-powered and they'll fly off the shelves for twice the price!)I was skeptical, but loved the fact that it was so small and could get dropped into my dop kit without taking up any space. I still love that, however, I don't like that it takes two hands to operate. Because of this and the fact that it almost has to move when in use (since you are rotating it yourself) it's hard to be accurate and reach into tight spots.As has been mentioned in other reviews, the build quality on this is first class. I bet I could run over this thing with my car and it would still be fine.I might keep this just to have as a travel trimmer, but for every-week use, I'm going to have to get another battery-powered one. This just isn't convenient or functional enough for that.</review>

<review id="8735">Got the router last week, easily set it up with either cable and DSL modem (I have both services). Wired connection worked right away. My gigabit NAS is getting write speed >100Mbps. The problem is setting up the wireless connection. Initially tried both WEP and WPA2 encryption (my old setting). All four computers had trouble connecting: either no connection or showing connected but ping request did not work. I had to called CS numerous times. In one case a lady charged me $9.99 to work remotely and somehow get it going which later only lasted for a night and then everything went crazy like before again. In another call, a guy changed nearly all parameters in Advance Wirelss Settings from default to some strange numbers and got it going again. This time it was stable for awhile. The problem is unstable connection: my laptop (with Intel Wireless-n card) was 3ft away but connected at 5.5Mbps. Asked CS if they could diagnosis whether the product is defective. Nobody could do it. Now I have returned the item.Other observation:1) Heat does not seem to be big problem2) Do not try to upgrade the firmware from factory 1.0.04 to 1.0.06 (Linksys website). Otherwise the encryption choice box between TKIP and AES for WPA personal and WPA enterprise will be goine. Then you are stuck with default TKIP mode which limits wireless speed to &lt;56Mbps.3) No true connected device table but only DHCP client table. So if you rstatic IP devices are configured on device side, you will not see it anywhere in WRT310 software interface. I ended up changing all my devices (2 NAS and 1 print server) to be DHCP on device side then reserve IPs on WRT310N to make it work.</review>

<review id="8737">I've recently reviewed Turbotax as well, with it's shortcomings I ordered Taxcut as well since my faith in TT was not very sound. I give Taxcut 4 stars for finding deductions, three stars for usability and 1 star for the most important thing of all: getting me my refund! It would not let me electronically file informing me: The IRS is not ready to receive your return due to certain tax form delays. An update will be ready on February 7th. This was January 31st...no problem. On February 7th it was updated to March 10th. I should have pursued it further but eventually today I contacted Taxcut support to see what the real story was. Even though the forms were updated Jan 31st they hadn't finished the update for the software and now it would be March 12th! I will take some responsibility here. But they should have advised me it would have been faster to paper file and not have blamed the IRS for their shortcomings. I returned to Turbotax and filed that way with no problem. So basically Turbotax + Taxcut MIGHT = a real tax software program.When it comes right down to it, there is not a lot of software out there that is used for ONE basic thing. This software is for filing your tax return in a correct but also a timely manner. As far as I can tell both Turbotax and Taxcut fail if you don't have all but a very simple return to file this year.Comment</review>

<review id="8738">After I ordered the WRT54G I read that Linksys modified it so that it has less memory and no longer runs Linux as its OS so you can no longer update the firmware. I consider this to be a major downgrade.  Apparently if your serial number begins with "CDFB" you have a version 5 unit with the downgrade.  The one I just ordered from Amazon is a downgraded unit and I am going to return it.You can still buy the Linux based unit, but it is being sold as a new product, the WRT54GL and it appears to be priced at a premium.</review>

<review id="8739">To start off, I loved Twilight & New Moon. Eclipse was still good, but not as exciting as the first two. I strongly disliked Breaking Dawn, and even though Twilight & New Moon are two of my favorite books, I will probably never read them again based on Breaking Dawn. WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW.-----------------  My first reason for disliking Breaking Dawn so much is that it doesn't at all fit in with the previous 3 books. What happened to Edward? He was always so romantic and protective to Bella. I was disappointed with Alice as well. She had always been so cheerful and close with Bella, but in Breaking Dawn her character was hardly mentioned, and when it was, she way different. (except for maybe the wedding).  I think that everything was way too rushed. In the beginning of the book, Bella is has just gotten engaged to Edward and by the end they are married, have a child that Jacob has imprinted on, problems with the Volturi, Alice leaving, Jacob switching packs, etc. And if you think about it this all happens in just a few months. (Bella & Edward got married in late August, and the book ends in like the beginning of January) which is COMPLETELY unrealistic, even if it is a book about vampires. The time lapse completely annoyed me and had me confused.  I didn't like the honeymoon scene. It seemed like all Bella cared about was sex and in the other books she had just been happy being with Edward and didn't cry if his clothes weren't off. Also on their wedding night, Edward gives Bella bruises from "doing it" and says he is not going to make love with her again until she is immortal. But then Bella somehow convinces him into it and they do it a few days later. First of all, Bella has never been able to convince Edward into doing anything in the earlier books, especially if Edward had hurt her. I just thought this was way out of character for him even if it was to make Bella happy.   Along with a lot of people, I found it completely unrealistic how Bella got pregnant. If the vampires have no blood or anything how would that work? And wouldn't his venom been inserted into her instead of "other stuff"? I know this is a fantasy book and all, but I think it should atleast make SOME sense biologically.  About the Jacob book - I had no problem with this at all, especially since Jacob is my favorite character, but after he imprinted on Renesmee, his whole point of view being thrown in there was completely pointless. Most of his book talks about his troubles as a werewolf (I hate the term shape-shifter). What I really liked was the part with Leah. I was totally hoping they would end up being together - him imprinting on her or something. They both understood each other really well, considering they had the same type of pain (Sam and Bella). I thought it would be cool if Leah helped Jacob get over Bella instead of him imprinting on Renesmee, speaking of, I found disgusting. Not just because Jacob is like 17 and Renesmee is a baby, but he was so in love with Bella and now that's just completely over with because he is head over heals for her daughter? It mad no sense at all, and like I said, him and Leah getting together would make a much more interesting twist.  After Bella turned into a vampire, she lost her character. She wasn't the clumsy, embarrassed type she always was, so I think Stephenie Meyer should of added this toward the end. Then again, Edward only turned her into a vampire to save her life when she almost died in giving birth to Renesmee. It would of been interesting to see what would of happened if Renesmee never existed.   Another thing - Bella finally tells Edward she does want to enroll in classes at Dartmouth before being turned immortal and Edward disagrees with her. Again, out of character for him. In Eclipse, this was Edward's whole battle - to get Bella to go to college and be turned immortal after and now he doesn't care any more. Speaking of Edward, since Renesmee had to be thrown into this book, I think they should of had more interaction. I can't remember one scene where Edward was talking to her or anything. I didn't get it at all, considering he is her father.  The Volturi/Ending - Probably the worst part of the book. I got so bored that I almost quit reading it - just chapter after chapter talking about the Volturi coming, all the Vampire clans at the Cullen's house, etc. and then nothing happens. All they do is kill Irina, which I think is the last person who should of been executed, considering they believed her and came out there to kill Bella and Edward. I didn't understand why Bella would be killed also - she was now immortal, and it was Edward who got her pregnant. I didn't understand the reasoning behind it. There wasn't even a fight - just them leaving, which I think didn't make sense considering the Volturi's previous behavior in the other 3 books. But then again if Renesmee was never born, Bella wouldn't (but maybe) be immortal yet and the Volturi would of never came. So if you change one thing, the whole book changes.I didn't like this book at all, in a sense it almost ruined the saga. I'm not sure if you agree or not, but this is my personal opinion.</review>

<review id="8741">I've found the product easy to use but found some problems. Arithmetic rounding resulted in a computation error on one of the forms (Federal 8606). There is the option of manually overriding the computation if you're willing to lose the benefit of H&R backing you if you're challenged by the IRS. Also, the program does not allow input and display of cents, and does not automatically generate .pdf files of the completed tax forms and work sheets. That would not have been a serious problem but the process of explicitly generating the files resulted in my calling Taxcut's Product Support. The program couldn't deal with the presence of Adobe's Printer 995 in Vista. The support phone was answered on the second ring by a real person, but I was underwhelmed by the lack of knowledge of the support person. We eventually solved the problem together. Later inspection of the .pdf file containing the support sheets revealed a total lack of adherence to top & bottom page boundaries. The resulting looked very unprofessional and difficult to use. Hopefully, I won't ever have to refer to them.</review>

<review id="8743">I was an early booster for the Meyer's book Twilight, hailing it as absorbing for both adult and adolescent readers.  I even compared it to Anne Rice's superior Interview with a Vampire, based on unique, well-drawn characters and innovative twists with the traditional legends.  It's been downhill from there, unfortunately.  Writing is one of the hardest jobs on the planet and imagining people, places, events, desires, etc. takes time and much reflection.  While Meyers is quite skilled as a writer, she has failed to take the time to she needs to reflect which is all too evident with this last gasp at the vampire line.  Edward & Bella are not the two characters that launched Twilight--they are a faded photocopy done from a machine whose toner needs replacement.  Sad.The beginning of this book puzzled me--for some reason, I thought the marriage ceremony would take place perhaps halfway in the plot but it practically begins the book like a shotgun wedding.  From that high point, it's a rapid descent into the flatlands.  Tiny scenes remind me of the writer of Twilight, but too few.  Someone else could have written this book.Give me a break on the ending.  Please.  I don't believe for one second that Bella's father would be so accepting of his daughter's condition and his new in-laws.  It was the contrast between the real world and the vampire one that gave this story some tension--now it's the Addams family.I can only attribute this downhill curve to the desire for money and profit.  Publishers want to capitalize on success immediately and the new writer is flattered into writing nonstop to fill bank accounts.Meyers will regret trashing her series.</review>

<review id="8744">I wanted to see and hear the content of "Religulous" when it first hit theatres because I wanted to know what other people will see and hear. There is so much that I could say in response to the entire presentation, but I'll limit myself to responding to Bill Maher's closing statement, which was far more serious than the rest of his presentation. He said, "Anyone who tells you that they know, they just know what happens when you die, I promise you, you don't. How can I be so sure? Because I don't know, and you do not posess mental powers that I do not".By the grace of almighty God, Christians do have the "power" that Bill Maher has yet to experience. It is the same miraculous power that gives spiritual life to the spiritually dead. Christians are able to identify with this letter that is addressed to them. Ephesians 2:1-10, "And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest. But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them".Every Christian's personal testimony may be found in Ezekiel 36:26-27, which says, "Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will be careful to observe My ordinances".The foundation of Christianity is not in our DOING. It is DONE. Finished by the object of our faith, the perfect, sinless life of Jesus Christ, which has been imputed by God to His people for eternity. He is the only One who has the power to draw you, or anyone else to Himself.</review>

<review id="8746">Positive thinking works: thinking you will succeed in improving yourself and reaching your goals *does*, of course, make it more likely you will--we are all more energetic and efficient when we anticipate success than failure, sometimes astonishing so. Even medically, our mind affect out health. Optimistic people tend to have higher recovery rates than those who are sure they will die; and, conversely, grief and depression can literally kill. The problem with "the Secret" is that it takes these observations to the absolute extreme. Our mind, and our way of viewing things, not only *affects* our actions and our body. it literally creates the entire universe. You want a new car? Just think about it, and it will come to you. Just think your cancer will go away and it will. This is no longer optimistic: it is delusional.The "Secret" claims it is a "Scientific Law"--the "Law of Attraction"--just like gravity, and "supports" this claim with a lot of impressive-sounding, but meaningless, pseudo-Quantum-Mechanics mumbo-jumbo. It goes without saying that none of the "scientific studies" the people in the DVD tell you actually exist ("Scientific studies" show a positive though is hundreds of time more powerful than a negative one? Where was *that* published?) and none of the "experts" on the DVD have any training in real science.Even worse than the scientific illiteracy is the greed, racism, and utter moral bankrupcy of "The Secret"'s producers. First of all, the westerner in the film all wish for expensive toys: nice cars, mansions, diamonds and furs, etc. Nobody seems to think that, perhaps, one should use the all-powerful LOA to wish for the curing children of cancer or the eradication of AIDS; that's a lot less important than, say, a new Rolex. Also, to answer the obvious question of where this abundance will come from if everybody on earth wishes for mansions and BMWs, we see shots of a chinese peasant wishing for geese, and other simple, primitive people wishing for similar simple, primitive things. Don't worry, America: those silly natives are incapable of imagining or wanting the *really* good stuff, so you can keep wishing for vacation homes and Ferarris without fearing their competition. They would be *glad* to use the LOA to wish themselves into being your servants if you only feed them well, Sahib.Worst of all is the obvious question: if the LOA is so powerful, why is there so much undeserved suffering in the world? If only children dying of cancer weren't such negative sourpusses, it surely wouldn't have happened to them. If the jews in the cattle cars heading to Auschwitz only started singing "Oh what a Beautiful Morning" and formed Conga lines while imagining themselves free, the LOA would have stopped the holocaust. After all, one positive though is hundreds of times more powerful than a negative one, so one positive-thinking jew would have been enough to stop a regiment of negative-thinking Germans. And if you really believe that...</review>

Got brave and went to back up ~8GB datafiles ... the back up started but then went on and on and on and on and on and on (get the picture?).  Finally, a UNABLE TO WRITE DATA - HARDWARE FAILURE message popped up.  Power cycled the drive, checked the connections and tried again.  No luck.  Ran SureDelete File to delete the datafiles that did make it to the drive, but encountered the same hardware failure error.  Was able to reformat the drive and clean it with SureDelete Disk.  Got brave again and tried to copy a set of data to the Simpletech ... big mistake.  Got the hardware failure error again.  Reformat / Disk Clean / Reformat / Disk Clean then packed it up and returned it to Costco.  These things seem to be hit or miss - it works or it doesn't.  Mine didn't.</review>

<review id="8750">This &quot;mini processor&quot; looks nice, but doesn't work worth a darn:  Most food gets plaster against the side of the container, and what gets stuck under the blades gets ground to a pulp.  Add to that, the flimsy plastic ring that holds the two cutting blades cracks after a couple of uses, and Cuisinart wants $12 to replace it...  half the price of another processor.  Better to spend the money on another brand that will last.</review>

<review id="8751">This coffee maker looks pretty decent and I thought a cuisinart would do the trick. But, the actual coffee really lacks flavor. I don't know if the water doesn't get hot enough of the pressure is not enough or what but, it really just tastes like a cup of coffee that you would get out of any $25.00 machine. Put your money towards something better!</review>

<review id="8752">Ok so i'm not going to bash Breaking Dawn like a lot of people did.  i agree that it wasn't the best book in the series but it was entertaining and well written.  some of the author's plots were a little predictible and packaged a little too pretty but oh well...it's a young adult novel for pete's sake.  my main complaint about the book is simply that there wasn't any fighting.  yes, there's more to my complaint than lack of violence but i expected there to be SOME fighting somewhere.  mostly it was arguing and internal struggle or some crap like that.  i was hoping for a fight with the volturi.  i didn't want to see everyone die but with the great fight scenes from previous books, i was hoping for something.  the whole "Nessie" thing was a little annoying but sure...she had to come up with some way to keep Jacob around and to get the volturi to come back so i'll let that slide.  i think Stephanie Meyer was trying to rush a bit too much to get this book out (i was grateful though cuz i was curious as to how she'd end it) that she didn't take the time to get a really good plot and really good ideas.  kinda seemed like she settled for easy vs good.  overall, i enjoyed the book...mostly.  and i'm looking forward to the movie (and maybe more than one).  but i think she missed the mark with Breaking Dawn...BIG TIME!</review>

<review id="8753">It's getting harder and harder to find product reviews on Amazon. I had to scroll down almost 3 pages of Intuit plugging and product description just to find the first review. Apparently, Amazon seems to be forgetting a little bit just what made it so popular.In any event, I'll keep it short. I ordered Quickbooks Pro and installed it. And, at the end of the install process, what do you think pops up? A window asking me to call Intuit. Yes, I could NOT USE the software that I PAID FOR without calling Intuit ON THE PHONE and registering my product only after giving them all sorts of information about myself AND MY BUSINESS!!! I called and quickly told them that I was sending the software back. I think I spoke to someone in India or something.I'll go and find accounting software that doesn't require me calling the company and giving all sorts of personal information about myself and my business.</review>

<review id="8754">I thought this was the best gate out there until our 22 month old daughter got her leg stuck between the bars.  Since they are made of such durable metal, the bars had to be sawed in half to get her leg out because her leg was turning blue.  Now I see why the inexpensive wooden ones with plastic are better.  I went back and looked at the instruction manual to see if I was somehow misusing the gate and the only thing I could see related to this incident was "never leave child unattended".  The gate was in her bedroom doorway and I was in the next room for 5 minutes when she got her leg stuck.  Until this incident, we thought this was the best gate ever and never even had any problems with the plastic pedal breaking.  I never even thought about legs getting stuck between the bars when we bought this gate, but before posting this review, I've read all the other reviews and saw 2 or 3 with the same comment.</review>

<review id="8757">If a company wants to charge more for an improved product because realistically they need to cover the costs that went into creating that better product, fine.  But this new price structure is just garbage.  Clearly Intuit is at that point with TurboTax where they think people will stomach unjustified price increases because (a) changing software is annoying and (b) it's still cheaper than paying a tax professional.  I hope they are sorely mistaken.  I urge people not to be scared of trying a new product this year.  I have used TurboTax every year since I started doing my taxes and am excited to move on to a new product this year.</review>

<review id="8758">In all fairness, I am rating this very poorly out of the frustration of having received a faulty product that had been returned to Amazon from a previous buyer.I received mine yesterday and was very elated, after having waited for awhile to receive it and it was not only non-functioning, but it was an item that had been returned by some else, because it was faulty: everything is written in Chinese and when I attempted to change the language setting, nothing worked, I checked the existing folders on the computer and they were all filled w/malware... And here's the kicker: I found the receipt from the previous customer when I went to retrieve my own receipt to explain my situation to Customer Service.Customer service was super-helpful and Amazon should be thanking them for the efforts that they make, yet there's no substitution for the inconvenience that has resulted, due to this error.  I really wanted to use and enjoy this product in a timely manner.  There are no guarantees that I will be able to do so and my mid-terms are approaching.</review>

<review id="8759">These sheets feel about as rough as 100-thread count sheets.  They really don't feel very nice against your skin.  They're also stiff and way too thick.  I have 400- and 600-thread count sheets that are so much softer than these sheets.  These sheets are a complete waste of money.  Don't be fooled.I've already washed my sheets several times, and they're still rough, thick, and unpleasant to the touch.  The only thing remotely good about these sheets is that they don't wrinkle, but I don't think that makes them worth the price.</review>

<review id="8760">bought this about a month ago on Amazon.  The first time I wore it I noticed that it was unreliable.  It will give you accurate heart rate for about 30 minutes but then it fluctuates within 50 points back and forth.  It is not reliable.  I bought this so that I could train within my target zone but with this piece of junk you do not know where your heart rate is at any given second.  It jumps from 140 to 220 to 88 to 100 to 200.  Also, the monitor part that straps to your chest broke the third time I wore it so now I've just thrown it in the trash and will buy another brand..</review>

<review id="8761">While many cats like drinking from the tub/sink faucet, this product does NOT mimic that experience very well at all. I wouldn't expect every cat to like this fountain when the water moves so smoothly and somewhat uninterestingly down the ramp. I thought the water moving would attract my cat but it is pretty hard to see the water at all. My cat was interested for 10 minutes and was done with it for good. The fountain is quiet, and yes, you have to clean it and monitor it so the pump doesn't burn out. Overall it was more trouble than it was worth. Not recommended. I would try the fountains that bubble or have the water free-falling down from the spout. At least it would attract my cat.</review>

<review id="8762">Office 2008 is little more than window-dressing over the now-antiquated Office 2004.  There are a few improvements to a few minor details, such as in Powerpoint 08's custom animation workflow, where one can now select more than one graphic element to move order of appearance in the animation order panel, that is now optionally persistent (i.e. no longer in a modal dialog box that you have to click out of in order to see your changes.)  Much like iMovie 2008, the software advertises a streamlined, simplified workflow for beginners to the software, with a few new predefined templates for such things as posters, collateral campaigns, etc.  Yet also like the new iMovie, the "updated" software ignores the needs and wishes of its original constituency, more advanced users who have dutifully ponied up money update after update.  For example, Office-for-Mac users have been waiting patiently for years and years for Office to enable its users to customize command key actions, to speed up workflows -- such as the ability to tell office to link the key combination COMMAND + OPTION + I, say, to the action "import a new image."  Yet this ability, so fundamental to expert users, is missing from this update -- and Microsoft has done nothing even to enable such repetitive actions with its own keystroke functions.  The user is forced to import images using laborious menus or icon clicks.Even more galling, however, is the apparently anachronistic relationship between "Office 2008 for the Mac" and its analogue on the Windows side, Office 2007.  Whereas Office 2007 offers a dramatically redesigned, much more contextual user interface (for better or for worse), Office 2008 for Mac features no such redesign -- only a greatly fattened, Leopard-style grabber bar that features a few tools in its toolbar strip, a gross misuse of this new Leopard feature that, as far as I can tell, is impossible to remove.Further, new features included in Office 2007 for Windows are missing from Office 2008 for Mac.  The former's new ability to animate page elements along a path -- moving them from one place on the screen to another -- is missing from the latter.  Although this new feature is primitive and buggy in Office 2007 (most attempts to zoom in and edit an animation path resulted in an abrupt move of the windows focus back to the center of the screen, for example -- which is fine if you are editing a path that happens to BE in the center of the screen, but vexing and tedious if you're editing an element on an edge of the slide, as you keep needing to rescroll over to it after everything you do).  These and more features from Office 2007 I simply assumed would be in any product labeled "Office 2008".  Boy was I wrong.But wait -- there's more.  Microsoft's own registration system not only failed to complete, but was actually able to corrupt my Leopard MacBook's keychain to boot -- this last "surprise" leading to an apparently unnecessary deletion of my entire keychain -- a HUGE pain).  A look at Apple's discussions revealed that  apparently many users are experiencing such frankly inexcusable issues. To summarize, two familiar latin words come to mind for this clearly unambitious and half-baked piece of software:CAVEAT EMPTOR(BUYER BEWARE)</review>

<review id="8765">Far from user-friendly, you will be at the office later at night tearing out your hair trying to find the buttons on the tool bar for even the simplest of office tasks, wondering "Why did I get this program again?"

<review id="8766">The first time I picked up Twilight was in a bookstore months ago and as soon as I saw the word "vampire" I immediately put it down. However, after hearing so many good things about it I figured it was summertime and I needed a fun read. I eventually fell in love with it and the series and I was eagerly awaiting the release of Breaking Dawn. I was one of the few who found it at a grocery store early Friday morning before its midnight release. I finished it late that Friday night. I mulled over my opinion for a long time because honestly I believe I was in shock. Now I have finished reading it for a second time and believe that I can thoroughly express my opinion.But where to begin? As much as I want to love this book I just don't believe that I can. Especially now that I have read it twice I can really see the flaws throughout this book. The characters did seem to completely change...they went from being curious 17 year olds to 30 year old parents? (and, yes, I know Edward is mature and 100+ years old). But, if Mrs. Meyers wanted to write this as a more adult series she should have done so from the beginning. After reading a Q&A where she talks about how she wanted Nessie from the beginning, etc., but her publishers loved Jacob's character, I can see where she went wrong. It's just like when you are writing a research paper. You have to have a clear hypothesis. If you do not, then you will simply ramble on and hope that all of the lose ends are tied up and it will never seem to end...I am truly sorry that I could not love this book; I really wanted to. But, that just does not seem to be a possibility now because of the serious errors that are present throughout the plot, character development and the overall message of this final book. I am not angry, I am just merely disappointed.</review>

<review id="8767">I got this item, similar except blue, a couple of weeks ago. My college-issued Gateway M285 only has 40 gig of space and this would have been perfect to use for my music, my pictures, games, and class files from previous semesters that I may need to look back on in later years. One week after I got it, the mini-usb port started to come loose and the connection was unreliable. While moving my data to another external I have, the connection failed entirely with over half of my data still on the drive. I contacted Tech Support via the website, and they said they don't do repairs, just exchanges.Do I: a) loose all my data; b) pay hundreds for data recovery; or c) void the warranty by opening the case and tightening the connections myself. If you chose c, you're right!When I opened the case, I discovered that it contains a Western Digital Scorpio 250 gb 2.5" SATA hard drive model WD2500BEVS. Guess how big my tablet's HD is going to be in a few days?Overall, the drive & talking to tech support sucks, but the HD inside is of good quality.</review>

<review id="8768">First of all, I need to begin this stellar, award-winning review for the Phillips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver by declaring that by nature and the way God (sorry if I affronted liberals by including the Almighty's name!) made me, I'm a very hairy, almost Gorilla-like man in my body hair!!!! This has much to do with the fact that I'm an ethnic Albanian with a bit of Iraqi thrown in there and some Italian roots added just to top off the stew that I am. Thusly, having a huge amount of hair in areas below my neck--for you ladies, that would mean my back, underarms, chest, stomach, unmentionable nether-region, legs, and derriere--was never, ever an issue for me. Contrary to what the emasculated, liberal society in which we live would have you believe, all the women I've ever "been with" (if you get my meaning, wink, wink) have never, ever complained about my enormous excess of hair. Clearly, they must have all been traditional, non-liberal women who still appreciate their man to be masculine, more rugged and overall hairy--in sharp contrast with liberal gals who like their "men" to be even more emasculated versions of their g*y friends with whom to go shopping and cuddle. However, I began to seriously consider, and then eventually I bought, this Phillips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver because of my latest wife that I recently married. See, it was at her somewhat nagging urging that I succumbed and bought this shaver because she's used to men who are about as clean-shaven as a little Chihuahua! In fact, every man she's ever been with has been a totally clean-shaven, hairless "guy"; what made that scarier is the fact that these "guys" she's been with didn't even have legitimate excuses for being clean-shaven all over their bodies since they were neither bodybuilders or wrestlers! So, this was the dilemma I faced in my latest marriage, and rather than create an issue over it (and have her potentially "punish" me by withholding sex or banishing me to the proverbial couch), I surrendered to my little lady because I, like many men in our liberal societal culture, are WHIPPED by our wives. So, I largely purchased the Phillips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver to keep my marriage intact, something that's probably uncommon to the reason most so-called "guys" purchased this (not for cleanliness reasons, but probably to emasculate themselves and correspond to our larger, liberal society which assaults a man's nature). An additional piece of information about me that made it very difficult to even entertain the concept of shaving all my body hair like a little Chihuahua is the fact that I'm a hardcore, conservative, Sunni. In our "religion of peace" philosophy, it's very unmanly and therefore insulting to shave off body hair, since hair growth is considered very macho!!!! Unluckily, after the first few jabs with the Phillips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver into my pubic hair, it HURT LIKE HELL!!!! Hell hath no fury like a Sunni's wrath, right? WRONG!!!! Hell hath no fury like using this shaver on one's pubic region!!!! It only got worse from here. Keep in mind I originally subordinated and used said shaver to please my little wife. Well, during sex--which in our highly regimented ways of the "religion of peace" involves my wife dressed in nothing but a dishdash and an accompanying hijab with only the eyes showing (super hot)--my little wifey had the audacity to complain of the pricking stinging of the remaining stubble of my pubic region. Thanks Phillips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver!!!! The final episode in this rather wild-but-true story occurred when I met one of my best friends--who also happens to be AC DC, proving that many Sunnis like me are actually very tolerant of those afflicted with g*yness--for espressos at Starbucks. He edified me about the reasons that shaving one's body hair completely off was totally acceptable. Before he put it in context, I couldn't see the liberal light, but after my friend of g*yness explained it, it all made sense. After this talk, I'm now a 100% believer in shaving off ALL of my ugly, anti-feminine body hair--and I recommend EVERY MAN to buy this--due to the following reasons: 1) Body hair is unclean and raises infection risks 2) I may actually be mistaken for *gasp* a man instead of a woman 3) It's so passe to actually have the audacity as a man to look like a man in these progressive times we live in</review>

<review id="8769">I have owned various panasonic beard trimmers for past 20 years, untli the non-replaceable batteries go bad.  This is the first one I have had which sucks the trimmings into a built-in container, which is a great idea.  The problem is it clogs every 2-3 strokes, which makes it unusable.  Now, if you use this on a daily or every 2-3 day basis, and are cutting hairs taht are 1/8" long, for instance, I bet it would work well.  But when you do trimming every 1-2 weeks, and the hair is 1/4" or longer for head hair, it will clog, and this product is not for you.  So I would give it 0 stars if you are like me, or 4 stars if you plan on using it constantly, for an overall score of 2 stars.</review>

<review id="8770">I used Turbo Tax for a number of years but never will again. Starting a couple of years ago this product started becoming progressively worse and I now find it inadequate. A couple of examples: 1) if you have a business and buy a computer that you use both personally and for business, this software cannot work out the correct deduction; 2) if you have any trading income (futures, stocks, etc), this software cannot figure out how to report these gains correctly. The software claims it can do these things and it does do them in a "way," unfortunately my experience was it does not do them correctly. This is OK if you assume you will never be audited or don't care about an accurate return, but otherwise it's essentially worthless (or worse if you're audited). Turbo Tax used to be an excellent product, sadly it no longer is. Current product is fine if your return is very simple, but any complexity at all and it's just not up to the job.Bottom line: Trying to do my return with TurboTax 2007 was an extremely aggravating and ultimately unsuccessful experience. I had to go to an accountant to get my return done correctly.</review>

<review id="8771">Like other reviewers, this drive died on me. I didn't notice it getting hot, but one day it just quit. Multiple utilities on Windows XP and Mac OS X Leopard couldn't get the volume on the disk to mount; repairing was out of the question, since who wants to use an unreliable disk as a back-up?The case is cute enough. But, from the reviews, I just guess the thing doesn't work right. I have other backup drives that have lasted a lot longer</review>

<review id="8772">I did read all the reviews here before buying this product. After my first week experience with the product, I regret that I bought it.When I plugged the device in the first time using Firewire it worked great for about three hours. My first time machine backup failed after about 3GB of data was transferred. After that, the device would not appear anymore on the Mac Pro.The USB connection proved more workable, though every once in a while the time machine backup fails but at least the device stays mounted.There is apparently a problem with remounting the device after it was unmounted. This is inline with the experiences of other people that had problems. The work around is to wait several hours with the device completed unplugged (power + usb + firewire). Whenever I did this, the device automatically mounted when plugged in again.When the device is unmounted from the OS. There was no way to get it to mount again without the downtime. I noticed an error message in the logs on the mac pro regarding the usb device.If you are not so tech savy, then I recommend you NOT to buy this product. If you are tech savy, the device is not reliable enough to be used in any kind of RAID-1 setup without giving you sleepless nights. The later is for what I bought it and the product did not fulfill my expectations.</review>

<review id="8773">Twilight drew me in to a sweet love story.  New Moon drew me into the heartbreak of love lost.  Eclipse drew me into the love triangle between human girl, vampire guy & werewolf guy.  Breaking Dawn ... (mind you after reading it TWICE) left me bewildered as to what Meyer's was thinking.  It is an epic failure, with no cohesion to the previous 3 novels.</review>

<review id="8774">I have been epilating for years using my trusted Panasonic, and it does not hurt much at all.  However, since moving to the US, the electric voltage difference did not provide sufficient power to my Panasonic.  So I walked into a store and bought this product through convenience, but to my big mistake.This product is painful, and the supposed pain relieving rollers do not help at all.  In fact, it scratches the surface of your skin leaving it flaky.  This product is not effective at removing hair from the roots.  From my experience, it breaks the hair off at skin level, which means that you will see hair regrowth quicker.The light is also very annoying, and actually makes it harder to see the tiny hairs on your skin because it is too bright.  And, you do not have the option to turn off the light.  This comes on automatically when you switch on the epilator.The shaving component of this tool does not provide a close shave either, and you can still see the blunt edge of your hair on your skin.  You are better off with your trusted razor than using this for shaving!As I said, I have been epilating for many years and have grown used to the pain, and for me, I feel little pain.  But this product makes me feel as though I am epilating for the first time ever.  DO NOT BUY IT.  You are wasting your money.</review>

<review id="8779">At the time, I was 12, and I had seen Twilight in book stores hundreds of times. I had never paid it any attention until one day I finally decided to read it. I had read the back cover, but it wasn't too informative, but I did gather the fact that it was typically about vampire love. So, against my better judgment, I thought "Well, if I've seen it this many times it MUST be good." The beginning of Stephenie Meyer's writing leaves so much to be desired. In all of her books, for the first 150-200 pages I am bored out my mind, wishing for SOMETHING exciting to happen. I remember reading Twilight and being at least a hundred pages in and not caring about any of the characters at all. If they all decided to jump off a bridge I doubt I would have batted an eyelash. But then, something that changes the entire story occurs and it finally gets interesting 'till the point where I just can't put the book down. That is, until Breaking Dawn. I remember being at page 107, and looking at the 550-600 more pages I had to read and feeling like breaking down and crying. I wanted to chuck the book out the window and just have my friends fill me in on what happened, because I was just sick of it all. I had to force myself to read what I did, and every five minutes or so I got distracted by something around me because the book just couldn't hold my attention.In Twilight, I instantly liked Edward because of what I thought he'd be, but then later I realized I got his personality all wrong. I imagined he'd be . . . I don't know, different. Deep, meaningful, calm, cool, collected. Not some overactive stalker. (He said to her face that when she got to Forks he WATCHED her SLEEP. I mean, mega ew much?) Bella, I hardly had much of an opinion on until much later. She wasn't strong enough for me to respect, didn't have enough of a personality for me to like, and wasn't practical or smart enough for me to even comprehend. Her boyfriend was a freakin VAMPIRE, and she's totally fine with that. She wasn't terrified, or even the slightest bit nervous, which makes no sense. Think about it for a second: If your boyfriend is a VAMPIRE, would you be THAT cool about it? You wouldn't be scared at all, when a month ago the thought of a vampire existing would have you laughing at the absurdity? But here, Bella is introduced to a world of vampires and werewolves and she's pretty much chill with it all. Um, where's the conflict? Where's the "OMG YOU'RE A VAMPIRE?" Where's the "Ohmygoodnesswhatonearthisgoingon?" panic attack? Vampires and werewolves don't just waltz into everyday life and I expected at least SOME kind of resentment or hesitation Bella would have for Edward. But oh no, that would make too much sense.In New Moon, I had the slight hope that maybe through the course of the series Meyer would have Bella grow and develop into a strong, wonderful and mature character. Sadly, she didn't. To the very end, Bella remains a selfish, impractical, and illogical girl who for the life of me I can't stand. Jacob was the only one with a sliver of a complex personality. He had a goal and did everything in his power to achieve it, and throughout the books you saw the different faces of his personality. Everyone else's personality could just be classified with one or two descriptions. I won't even get into Eclipse, because I can never remember what it was about. [Spoilers] Okay, from the beginning. What was with that wedding? The wedding was something I was actually EXCITED about. I thought "Oh, wow, I wonder how Alice is going to out due herself." Honestly, I don't even remember what anything looked like. Weren't the colors white and blue? That's probably wrong, but then again that's Stephenie Meyer's horrible descriptions at work. Most of the time I just imagine what everything and everyone looks like for myself. I didn't even KNOW Alice had spiky hair until the third book when Bella patted her head. "What? Alice has spiky hair? Since when?" And I didn't have a single clue as to what Jasper looked like besides that he had golden eyes and was blonde, and then after Bella becomes a vampire they mention his scars. Oh, and there's also the fact that Rosalie is gorgeous. Well, come on now, how descriptive is that? Gorgeous HOW? Like, pretty pretty model gorgeous? Or sophisticated gorgeous? Or seductress gorgeous? Meyer, come on girl, surely you can be more creative than just using vague descriptions about people. Now, the honeymoon was nice and all, something I thought she could have skipped until I saw the purpose it held. Bella gets pregnant! Oh joy! Oh hell. She's 19, and she gets pregnant. What kind of message was Stephenie Meyer trying to send to the young audience that reads her books? At least Edward had the decency to call Carlisle and assure Bella they would get Nessie out of her. (I am going to call her Nessie, because I think Renesmee is a hideous name and Meyer should be slapped for even considering it for the girl.) But what does Bella do? She stops him. She suddenly gets an overpowering sense of maternal instincts and wants to keep her baby. Bella didn't even really like children, and before then she never had the slightest thought about wanting one. But now, she's suddenly ready to die for this thing that's sucking the life out of her. In plain text, Bella isn't the motherly type. I wouldn't trust her to take care of my dog, let alone a baby. Isn't this the same Bella who did dangerous stunts to hear a voice in her head? Isn't this the same Bella who, on a whim, thought it was fine to jump off a cliff in a rainstorm? Being pregnant doesn't magically make you a mom, or magically make you mature. It makes you utterly terrified. No matter whom you are or how old, for any woman who gets pregnant, her first instinct is to have her mom there at all times. But does Bella call Renee? Nope, she calls Rosalie. ROSALIE, PEOPLE. That makes SO much sense. Another point about Nessie: Wasn't she just the PERFECT baby? I mean, she was disgustingly perfect. I mean, when at all did Bella ever show any true motherly characteristics? I was surprised at Meyer, because she actually does have children, and I wondered what she was thinking when she wrote about Nessie. When did Bella ever feel the horrible strain that comes with taking care of a baby? Nessie was way too perfect. There was no constant feedings every two hours, there was no changing diaper after diaper, there was no shopping for baby clothes and supplies, there was no Nessie waking up at 3 AM and crying - which was a surprise, considering the head-board destroying sex Bella and Edward have every night. You'd think it would wake her up - and there was not much of anything. The only time Nessie cried was when she wanted Bella, which I thought was just plain ridiculous. (So what, she never wanted Edward?) Now, I understand that sometimes there IS such a thing as a quiet baby. I was one myself, and I never cried unless something was wrong with me, but there is no baby that just doesn't cry at all unless it wants its mom. That just doesn't happen. (Did anyone else feel Alice's statement that Nessie had never been set down in her life laughable? When I read that, I didn't know whether to fall out my chair laughing or give myself a face-palm and chuck the book into the dirt where it belonged. Honestly, I was surprised Nessie could even walk.)  May we move on to Jacob's point of view? I thought it was going to be, like, Jacob traveling the world from Canada to Mexico to South America to Greece and such on a spiritual journey to find himself and realize that he really, really didn't need Bella. But again, I was wrong and expected too much. No, instead he hangs around Forks, determined to stay with Bella until she has her monster baby and they turn her into a vampire. Oh, but there's a solution! They can abort the baby, and then Jacob can have a baby with Bella the NORMAL way, so Bella can still have a child. Btw, this was Edward's idea. Btw, Jacob agreed. Ew, much. Ew on so many levels. But I guess Bella isn't THAT sick because he didn't agree. One of the smartest moves she's made this whole series. Another thing, I hated how Bella skipped the newborn stage. I was actually excited about that, wishing, praying that Bella would turn evil and start killing off humans. Wouldn't that be so interesting?! Her, the heroine, suddenly becoming the evil villain, using her vampire powers for her evil deeds. And wouldn't it have been beautiful if the Cullens and Blacks and Volturi and whatnot had to, oh goodness, KILL her to preserve the secret and save humanity? I would have loved Meyer if anything remotely relating to that had happened. But, as I've learned, I always expect this woman to redeem herself and the whole series be worthwhile, only to be continually disappointed.      So, why did Bella skip the newborn stage? Oh right, because it was her state of mind. She didn't WANT to be one, therefore she WASN'T. Because Bella is SPESHUL, therefore she can DEFY the natural laws Meyer has set up. But since Meyer just wants all her characters to be happy, even if it means doing so in the most illogical ways, she decided to have the most sugar-coated fairytale ending I'd ever read in my life that wasn't in picture book. So, Bella gets everything she wants, including Edward, a baby, a family, immortality and tons and tons of sex? Check. Jacob has someone, even though she's 2 months old and it makes him a pedo? Check. The Volturi are defeated without actually engaging them in battle, causing the most depressing let-down in the history of potential battle scenes ever? Check. Sugar cakes and muffins and gummy bears rain from a glittering sky and Carebears run frolicking through the meadows of innocence as the final ending? Check. Well, well, Meyer, you've outdone yourself if I do say so myself.</review>

<review id="8780">I was hoping to upgrade my bed with these sheets. I don't make a lot of money so I was excited to get a good deal and treat myself to a rare luxury. They are very deep with sturdy elastic if you have a thick mattress or a featherbed but they sure aren't soft (they feel scratchier than my old ones). They also are much more wrinkly than my old ones so it turns out I spent my money on a downgrade. I washed them twice in hopes of softening them but they only got worse and are wrinkly even warm from the dryer. I wish I hadn't washed them so I could get my money back. I'm going to donate them to the shelter and go back to my old sheets. If anyone knows where I can get a good deal on some nice SOFT sheets please let me know!</review>

<review id="8783">The Zen is a very good mp3 and video player.  You have to convert every video to 320x240 wmv format, which takes as long as the video length to convert.  My main qualm with the player is that it has a penchant for restarting sometimes when it is attached to my computer.  One time it turned itself off when it was charging and subsequently never turned back on (it had basically a full battery).  Pushing reset of the power button yielded no result.  So I sent it back to Creative and got a "new" one.  This "new" one had the battery warning on the back in French (it came from the RMA facility in Stillwater, OK).  The day after I got it back, I (stupidly) decided that it would be a good idea to update the firmware.  Upon restarting for the upgrade, the player got to a state from which it has not returned.  Upon startup, it displays the initial creative screen and subsequently goes blank.  There is supposed to be another Zen screen followed by the ability to actually use the player.  In other words, it does not turn on again and is unusable.  I have not seen any real difference between the firmware versions on the player (I have updated it many times).  My advice would be to stick with the version you have.</review>

<review id="8784">This is my first heart rate monitor, and I didn't want to go with something fancy and expensive so I did not expect way too much. I should have spent a bit more money, however. The monitor came with the transmitter battery dead. So I changed the baterry in a bike shop nearby ($5) and it worked fine...for 2 days. Two problems:- it did not work in water at all (useless while swimming)- a plastic piece on transmitter strap snapped and broke off 2nd day of use (while sitting! I was monitoring my heart rate all day in the office).Luckily, returns with Amazon are quite painless.</review>

<review id="8785">I can't say this is a very effective piece of equipment.  I bought it all excited that it would speed the process up.  It does the reverse.  In order for use you need to first trim everything down to a lower level typically using a beard grommer.  Then you can use this tool but if you want to get a little closer you'll need a straight edge razor.  Your better off just buying a beard grommer and razor.  This is fairly worthless piece of equipment.</review>

<review id="8786">After giving MS Office 2007 a 6-week good faith effort, I had it removed and Office XP 2003 re-installed. I have never objected to having to look things up in online help, but in this case the trouble far exceeded the benefit..and it never let up. In the field of applied behavior analysis is a concept called "stimulus control" that describes how stimuli in the environment (such as the size and relative position of traffic lights, brake pedals, menubars, icons, etc.) come to shape our behavior, often in very useful ways. Microsoft needlessly changed stimuli throughout their software, rendering ineffective many of their customers' previously fluent behavioral repertoires (e.g., keyboard shortcuts, right-clicks, mouse-overs).</review>

<review id="8787">This is a beautiful coffee pot and the brew was terrific.  No complaints there.  My problem was with the design and layout of the clock.  When the coffee was brewing, excessive steam would rise and completely disable the clock.  The steam would get inside the mechanism which could only shorten the life of the timer I so desperately needed.  It would take an hour to regain visibility and after a week, I returned it as defective.  The second pot did exactly the same thing and I decided there must be better out there.  I can't recommend this great looking coffee pot, even though it made a really good cup of coffee.</review>

<review id="8799">Dragon 10.0 Crashes Outlook and Internet Explorer / Freezes System I upgraded to Dragon 10.0 prefered about a month ago. Unlike a lot of other users I had no problems installing it on a laptop using Windows XP. However, this afternoon I just uninstalled 10.0 and reloaded Dragon 9.5 since it is more stable as 10.0 freezes my Dell laptop and crashes both Windows and Internet Explorer requiring a reboot. I made sure to keep a backup of the original database to ensure that there is no corruption if I had to roll back my installation... I'm glad I did. One error I do get consistently on both versions is anytime I close the program I get a "acoustic.ini cannot be copied to ..." Error details. File exists. I have no choice but to use Dragon because of carpal tunnel, without it I cannot work. This program is not a luxury but the only way I can make a living. After almost a dozen crashes that started to occur more more frequently, plus having my IT department having to rebuild Outlook twice, it's time to roll back. I suggest that before anybody elects to update to Dragon 10.0 Prefered they wait until there is a service patch and save your money.</review>

<review id="8801">I've seen this movie countless times on cable when I was younger, and even taped it onto a VHS tape for repeated viewings.I think I actually felt my IQ score drop a few points after all those viewings.It truly is an awful movie!

<review id="8803">I've owned the MinoHD since late January. It makes reasonably good videos and is fairly easy to use. If you want to send a very short video by email, it works well, but if you want to send something that's longer the software tells you that the video is too long for email. Which means you have to make a DVD, which is not as straightforward as I thought it would be, but I'll come to that in a minute.As at least one reviewer commented, I don't think you get a full 60 minutes of recording time.The zoom lens is limited and you can't control the recording volume.  You can't upload videos longer than 10 minutes to YouTube.The DVD problem: You either have the choice of paying for the company's online service and have to wait to have the DVD mailed to you, or you have to buy additional third-party authoring software. I'm looking into the latter option now. I have no idea how much that costs. I need to be able to view my videos on computers other than my home computer and there's too much video to use the camcorder itself as a viewer.In addition, it takes a long time for the videos to be saved to the computer from the camcorder or to be uploaded into a format that will allow them to be saved to a DVD.So far, I am not at all impressed by their email technical support. Earlier, I asked a simple question and the response was a paraphrase of what I'd asked without the question mark.UPDATE, Feb. 28, 2009: Their email support is absolutely awful. You go around in circles. Call them on their supposedly 24/7 help line during the weekend and no one is available until Monday.UPDATE, March 2, 2009:  They did not call as promised and I had to call them.  It turns out my laptop can't run their software.  I'm going to have to buy DVD-burning software and they refused to recommend one.</review>

<review id="8807">I have enjoyed this product for almost three years. Last night, while I was making a smoothie for my two girls (19 months and 3 years old), the metal blade broke off in two pieces in the smoothie. I am very thankful that I noticed this (it started to sound funny); I shudder to think of what could have happened had I served the smoothie to my girls.I contacted Cuisinart today and, based on the serial number of my blender, they say it is too old to be under warranty (three years). It was purchased at an outlet store, so perhaps it had been on the shelf for a while. The person I spoke to expressed no surprise or concern that the sharp metal blade had broken off in two pieces into the food I was making!! All she seemed to care about what that it was no longer under warranty.This is a dangerous product and I would recommend all to avoid it.</review>

<review id="8808">I loved this coffeemaker -- for about a year, that is.  It made great coffee, was easy to clean, and had all the features I wanted, such as the ability to program it to start at a certain time.  But it died after a little more than one year.  For $100 machine, that's unacceptable.  For reference, I average one pot of coffee a day, which is probably below average for many, so it's not like it was overworked.  I bought this $100 machine to replace an old $30 20-year-old (seriously) programmable Mr. Coffee that never had a problem in its life.  It was still working when I replaced it.

<review id="8819">The WGR614 (I own the v4) is a breeze to install. Use your web browser to set up the router and you're ready to go. Setup should take you no more than 10 minutes, and the instructions are thorough to help those new to networking.However, the reliability of this device is lacking. Frequently, on both a wired and wireless connection, the connection would drop or slow to unbearable speeds. The wireless range of the WGR614 is only decent, and although it operates under 802.11g, you're better off with a 802.11b router due to this device's dropped connections and frequent losses in speed (Although I would recommend getting another brand of 802.11g router above the 802.11b). I have multiple routers and would recommend the D-Link wired or wireless routers over the listed router.Although this router supports a decent amount of features, is fairly flexible configuration-wise, and easy to set up, these features fail to redeem the WGR614's sheer lack of reliability.</review>

<review id="8822">The only redeeming quality (I felt) this series had was the intense relationship between Bella and Edward. Although I had argued that the writing has been terrible from the start, I enjoyed their romantic relationship because they were "so-o-o-o-o-o-o in love!" Hence, I did enjoy Twilight. New Moon was not that great, but I pushed through it in order to witness Edward and Bella's reunion in the end.Now let me get to Eclipse. What a horrible, stupid book. I hate to be harsh and insulting, but I am so frustrated. How can anyone believe Bella loves Edward at all??? You can't be deeply in love with someone if you ARE IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE! I think Bella is ridiculous, and if a series is going to be based on apparent "star-crossed" lovers, you can't have the heroine fall in love with someone else. Basically, this is what Eclipse is about:Bella- "I love you so much Edward, I don't ever want anyone else. Oh, wait, I lied, I want Jacob too. Who should I choose? Well, Edward, I love you MORE, so let's get married... Even though while we were engaged, I cheated on you."If you are rooting for a happy ending between Bella and Edward, don't read this. It will just make you mad. And by the way, NOTHING happened in this story. It was the same-old, same-old as in Twilight and New Moon. Vampires fighting Vampires due to Bella's stupidity.</review>

<review id="8823">For anyone who has been using Excel for many years (i.e. people like me who remember when it was called MultiPlan) - avoid "upgrading" to 2007 if at all possible. I'm sure there are some minor efficiencies that can be gained from the new ribbon interface - once you learn it - however, if you were just hoping to do things the way you were used to, you are out of luck. There is no way to opt for the "classic" interface. Microsoft apparently thinks that they know the best way for us to do our jobs and is forcing us to learn to do it their way.

<review id="8826">I was very excited to move into the world of *faster* wireless connectivity with the purchase of three WUS600N adapters and a Linksys WRT610N router.  I figured that any cross-manufacturer incompatibility issues would be moot if I used all Linksys products.  I was upgrading from a WRT54G (I think that's the model - it's a combo wired/wireless 802.11g router from Linksys).  I am running a HP Pavilion Vista desktop (directly downstairs from the router), a Gateway XP desktop (also directly downstairs from the router), and an XP Acer laptop (anywhere from the same room to four rooms away, about 30' max range).  I don't have any cordless phones or anything else that takes a wireless signal.  I live in a suburb with quarter acre lots, and to my knowledge, there's no big issue with interference from anything in the area.  Here's my experience:Out of the box, the laptop didn't work at all, the Vista machine connected great and continues to have great connectivity (184 MBPS, I believe).  The XP desktop had reasonable connectivity, but tended to hang with connections, and I've started getting memory allocation errors at odd times (could be a coincidence, but nothing else has changed since I installed the drivers for the adapter).  The laptop is an absolute disaster.  I couldn't get a connection at all.  I disabled the internal Broadcom wireless adapter, then changed to 40 MHz wide channel for both 5 and 2.4.  This permitted me to finally connect, although the signal strength at both 5 and 2.4 are far weaker than my old router.  I had issues with dropped signals, and it seemed like I had to constantly refresh the connection and reenter the security passphrase to get back on line - annoying!The latest/last straw has been that my latest Windows "Automatic Update" (just a couple days ago) seems to have killed my ability to connect at all.  I can't find anything on this anywhere - I have not dl'd the update for the XP desktop out of fear that I'll lose my connection there as well.  Grrrrr.... So... I think I'm going to can the adapter, or at least using the N protocol, and revert to G again.  I have to say that this has been a very frustrating ride.  I've wasted a good deal of money in the hope that getting name brand stuff (which is not my usual MO) would minimize the risks of problems.  Not the case.  I am also seeing the down side to being an early adopter.I'm not sure if it's the router, the adapter, or the combo/both/either, but this package is without question *not* ready for prime time.  Wait a while for the final protocol to come out, and wait for some reviews confirming compatibility across platforms, systems, and different ranges.  I'm hopeful that a firmware update will cure some of these issues, because I don't really have the time to fight with compatibility issues.  I've had the set up for less than a month and tried all kinds of things to make it better, but I'm thinking about returning everything - it just doesn't work.</review>

<review id="8827">The people at Final Draft really should have worked out all the bugs in Version 7.0 before releasing it to the public. I've used Final Draft for years and this new version is the first that has actually crashed my computer just trying to use it. Go To has problems, as does Index Cards, and even Spell Check doesn't perform properly for me. It doesn't even fix the spelling of the word after I've approved the change. Like the other writers here, I have returned to Version 6 until Final Draft gets the bugs out of this new version. So far, a complete waste of time and money. In this case, newer does not mean better. Stick with V6 if you want to get any work done!</review>

<review id="8828">This review is from: Quantum of Solace [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)      **1/2Those anticipating a smart, savvy follow-up to the superb, revivifying "Casino Royale" from 2006 will be sorely disappointed by "Quantum of Solace," an instantly forgettable entry in the ever-popular James Bond series.A muddled, barely coherent storyline - featuring a hitherto unknown group's involvement with some sort of badly explained eco-terrorism - is no match for the overwrought and overproduced nature of the film, in which Daniel Craig's 007 goes from being a complex, conflicted character in "Royale" to a soulless killing machine here.  The action sequences are hectic as all-get-out, but with no one at the center of them for us to really care about or root for, they quickly loss their luster and impact.Here's hoping for better things from the franchise next time out.</review>

<review id="8829">I have a fairly new high end computer with fewer USB ports than I have devices so I needed to expand. The reviews were great for the D-Link so I opted for this HUB. Clearly a misstake! I was expecting this unit to work with the following equipment:IPOD NanoCanon PowershotHP PrinterLogitech Fusion Web CameraPlantronics HeadsetSkype phone device (connecting a regular phone to the computer)The only thing that works without problems is the printer. The IPod is not recognized when plugged in to the HUB but works fine in any of the computer's own ports, the Web Cam takes 2 minutes to be recognized when plugged in to the Hub, the Canon Powershot is recognized but none of the programs used (Picasa or Canons own import software) is able to import any pictures when the camera is plugged in to the HUB and finally the sound quality is affected when using the plantronic's headset.Further the HUB blocks other built in memory card readers when plugged in in one of the sockets but not in an other and it blocks the BIOS when booting up if the third slot from left is used. Maybe I got a bad one, but one expects the units they sell to be tested before they go on to the shelves.</review>

<review id="8832">I purchased my CHI at the beginning of the summer. It worked very well while it was operational. After 4 months it began to short out. The power light would be on, it would heat up, and then the light would go off. After a while, the light no longer came on.Like other people's reviews, I tried to contact Farouk, but they were non-responsive to messages... or even picking up the phone. So, I too returned it to Amazon and had a restocking fee deducted from my $$ back.</review>

<review id="8833">Do not buy this version of Turbo Tax.  I thought the program would be on the disk - BUT IT'S NOT!  It's downloaded from the internet and the program runs incredibly slow.  I have used Turbo Tax for years (but I always purchased the program which was on the disk) and never had this problem.  Pay the extra $10 and save yourself a headache.</review>

<review id="8834">This thing gets two stars because it looks okay, and does actually toast bread. Other than that it deserves no stars.I have found it pretty much unusable as an oven because the themostat will occasionally shut off and cool all the way down before it kicks on again.  Things that used to take 12-15 min to cook took half an hour and I had to keep checking to make sure it didn't shut off.  Sanyo said it should heat consistently, but if it's not actually defective I would have to pay all the shipping costs(about a third the price of the total item) just to have it looked at.  Since it works fine for toast, I've just stopped using it for anything else - and tried to ignore the fact that Sanyo sold me a large steel convection oven that's good for nothing but browning bread.Unfortuately, this is not a product that you can ignore.  It's amazingly loud for just a toaster.  Touch any button and it emits a sharp loud beep - I thought I'd done something wrong the first time I heard it.  Start it up, and it makes a rattling whir that I normally associate with larger window fans.  When it's done, three loud sustained beeps that sound exactly like my smoke alarm, and are only slightly quieter.  If you have a small house or apartment, don't expect to use this while others are asleep.Sadly, I use this thing almost every day - as I said it does a fine job with toast, but I usually find myself wondering over breakfast how soon I can justifiably get rid of something that cost nearly a hundred bucks.</review>

<review id="8837">Although this product may work with certain barking behaviours (for example: territorial barking, attention seeking etc), it can't be stressed enough that this is not a solution if your dog is suffering from Separation Anxiety. It does not deal with the reasons behind the barking. Instead, it just makes your pet even more anxious whilst you are gone and eventually intensifies the problem. Please check this fact before using this type of collar in order to avoid further negative developments.</review>

<review id="8838">I have nothing bad to say about the filters or the vendor for these filters.  They were mailed immediately.  However, I bought the filters in a package deal with the water fountain. The vendor for the fountain was KV Vets Supplies from Nebraska.  They cancelled the order because of a "pricing error" and then tried to up the price on me.  So, now I have filters, but no fountain. Be aware of KV Vet Supply.  They may give you a good deal on their Amazon page, but when they cancel the order and up the price, Amazon has absolutely no customer service to help out.  Bad deal all around.</review>

<review id="8839">Inexpensive, but IMO pretty poorly constructed. The idea is good (pop all the kernels --- and it does that) but it is poorly put together with barely marginal parts that slip and so ultimately we just tossed it and went back to the old pot. Cannot recommend to buy.</review>

<review id="8840">DO NOT BUY THIS GRINDER!!!I have had nothing but problems with this grinder. I bought one of these grinder before Christmas and had to return it because the coffee bean hopper refused to seat properly into the grinder. Amazon shipped me another one and I ran into the same exact problem. I followed all of the instructions provided with the grinder and tried to install the hopper as it should be installed but it refused to go in. In case you were wondering, instead of a dial being used to control the fineness of the grind, the hopper is used to do this. I find this design to be extremely poor and part of the problem with the grinder. Also, the build quality is extremely cheap and the parts feel very flimsy. There are much better grinders available for the price so do not buy this one.</review>

<review id="8841">This product is not for men with thick hair.  I am not a hairy person by any means but what hair I do have is thick.

Until I get a better trimmer my groin is looking like a flock of seagles do.</review>

<review id="8843">I've had my router for about 6 months and the product stopped working.  I've tried the knowledge base on their site (which is useless) and also tried to contact customer support.

<review id="8844">The commercials and video for PediPaws make it seem like a dog owner's dream come true as far as nail trimming.  I did not have that experience.  I have two dogs.  One dog is very sensitive about having her legs or paws touched - she has a thing about legs and paws, and wants nobody coming near her legs.  She also is very hesitant to do anything unless it's on her terms - she's just that type of dog buddy.  I knew she would present problems with this device, no matter how non-invasive it was.  My other dog will allow you to poke and prod as much as you want and she doesn't mind a bit.  Put her on her back and rub her belly a little, and she's a calm as a cucumber.  She seems to have a high pain threshhold (not that we test this, but she tolerates uncomfortable vet procedures with no problem and has gotten into some situations where she's gotten herself stuck and does not panic or freak out - she's very relaxed).  I only give this background so you understand the predisposition of each dog to react to a strange new experience.  The PediPaws commercial and video that accompanies the product show a dog who seemingly doesn't mind having his/her nails filed with this device.  Upon watching these commercials, I was convinced that this was the product for us.  I followed the directions and introduced the product carefully with each dog at separate times.  I put it close to my dog, let her sniff it and get comfortable, gave her a treat, turned it on, put it closer to her, gave her another treat, etc., etc.  When I was confident she was very comfortable with the product when it was turned on, I followed the directions for how to have her lay, how to hold her, and how to hold the nail I was about to file.  My easy-going dog had no problem with any of this.  My nervous dog didn't like it, but she was resigned to letting this happen to her.  However, in both situations, the dogs completely freaked out when the PediPaws actually touched the nail.  There was nothing I could do alone to get either dog to stop squirming, which made it impossible to complete.  I followed the directions and persisted, as not to teach the dogs that squirming was the appropriate behavior to let them get their way.  I struggled and struggled to get one paw still enough to complete the filing.  In the end, the score was dogs two, human zero.  I then went to my husband for help.  At 6'4" and 220 pounds, adding him to the equation should have allowed us to get our desired outcome.  It didn't.  We went through the whole familiarizing process again, got the dogs comfortable, and then tried again.  There was absolutely no hope of this product trimming our dogs nails unless they were on heavy sedatives, or completely knocked out.    Frustrated, I watched the videos again.  I saw things I should have noticed from the beginning - the dog in the video/commercial is panting heavily, even though he/she in a comfortable indoor setting.  Dogs usually pant when they're hot or extremely nervous/uncomfortable.  I should have taken this as a warning sign - not a sign that the dog was just as happy as could be about the product.  Humans sweat when anxious or nervous... dogs pant.In the end, I spent over $20 to frighten my dogs, get some scrathes on my arms, and waste over an hour.  It would have been much easier for me to go to a trained professional and have him/her trip my dogs nails.  So it goes...</review>

<review id="8845">Bought this early to get a jump on my taxes.    The installer gets stuck at 87% - forever.    Intuit support page offers a vague suggestion with a note that they are looking into it.  Each time I attempt another suggestion, I have to uninstall, reboot, reinstall .... nothing.After 2 weeks, I cannot get this product to work.  Total waste of my money.  Update:  It's now been almost 4 weeks.   Called Intuit technical support, and the rep was polite and tried to help.   However, all he could offer was "engineering is aware of a problem and is looking into this", and he offered me a downloadable copy of the software in case I had a bad CD.   This did not help.So it's been a month, and I cannot use this software at all.  :-(</review>

<review id="8846">DO NOT buy this scale if you are trying to accurately measure your body fat percentage! I don't know how this scale has managed to recieve such good reviews, it's is horribly inaccurate at measuring anything other than weight. I am a 24 year old ex-college athlete and I exercise/lift weights 7 days a week, yet somehow, according to this scale, I have 27% body fat. I calculated using other methods (tape and calipers) and both reported 9-11%. I only give the scale two stars because it does accurately measure weight.

<review id="8847">Don't waste your money on Frontline.  I put a dose of this on each of my 2 cats after discovering a few days ago that they have fleas due to thier scratching the finding flea "dirt" when I combed them.  It's supposed to kill 98-100% of fleas within 24 hours.  Five days later they're still infested with them.  According to the brochure and the rep I just talked to at Merial, the fleas should get hyperactive and rise to the surface of the cat's fur before they die.  That has NOT happened with my cats.  I never saw a flea until tonight when I combed one of them and a flea flew off the comb.  Obviously it was way down in the hair coat, not rising to the surface dying, and when it jumped 2 feet in the air, it sure didn't look half dead.  Merial doesn't care and just said to keep using it for 3 months and it "should" kill the fleas by then and the ones in the environment. I should have gotten Advantage, but now I have to wait until next month to apply it.  The vets near my house don't sell it, but I should have ordered it on Amazon and waited. Years ago my cat had fleas.  I used Advantage and within half an hour, I saw tons of fleas crawling off of him and dying.  It was amazing! Now instead my poor cats are still scratching and very uncomfortable.</review>

<review id="8848">Bought this 2 months ago. About 2 weeks after I recevied it, the display failed to come on until the laptop warmed up (about 15 minutes). It is/was a heat issue, not a software issue. I confirmed this by heating up the laptop with a blow dryer. The display came on within 2 minutes instead of the normal 15 minute wait.I called Acer. They told me to send it in for repair. I did. The laptop came back "fixed". The letter said that they updated the BIOS!? I turned the computer on and no display. They had not even listened to the problem. So I called them again, and they said send it in again, this time an engineer will look at it. I told them all about the problem AGAIN and told them not to test the laptop when the computer is warm and plugged in because the problem only shows when the computer is room temperature. So I send it in again. I wait 2 weeks, get it back and what do you think happened? Yes, same letter, updated BIOS and I turn on the computer and no display for 15 minutes until the computer warms up!!!So now I call AGAIN. They tell me to send it in. I tell them that this time I want to talk to a manager and they forward me to customer care, which, apparently at Acer is the place you get sent when they just want you to go away. I was immediately told that there was nothing they could do for me other than send the laptop in a third time. And, I was told that I could NOT speak to a manager! or escalate the issue! The customer care rep told me that there was nothing she could do to ensure that if I sent it in again the same thing that had already happened twice would not happen again. Apparently I was just one of those customers that was out almost $400. I told her that I absolutely needed the computer for business and now was without it for almost 2 months and my money tied up couldn't buy another. Nothing. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY OR TAKE YOUR CHANCES.</review>

<review id="8850">I've been a long-time Quicken user. When I updated to 64-bit Vista, my Quicken 2006 was no longer able to print to my HP Officejet 7300 series printer. So, I upgraded to Quicken 2009 (which updates itself to R3), assuming that this would fix the problem. It did not. Quicken 2009 on (64-bit?) Vista cannot write to an HP Officejet 7310. I reported this problem to Intuit, but received only a canned response that was useless.(For those of you who encounter this problem, you must resort to using an HP 990c driver, as I learned from another user with the same problem, and then adjust the alignment so that checks are printed correctly. The printer must be "direct", not subject to spooling.)NOTE: when I purchased Quicken in October, it upgraded itself to R2, which has a very annoying bug of trying to install Outlook every time I entered a transaction. This was the version I initially reviewed and rated with 1 star. Since R3 was released in November, this problem went away. If I could, I'd change my rating to 2 or 3 stars, but Amazon does not appear to give me the option of changing my rating.</review>

<review id="8853">This product is unreliable and it is incompatible with other D-Link products.  I had high hopes for it, but found it would restart constantly when there was any significant traffic going through it.  Moreover, when I tried to run it in "Pre-N" mode with an AppleTV, I was unable to get it to connect at anything higher than 54Mbps and would not work at all with another D-Link product (Wireless Game adapter) that only supported "G" mode.  I was also very concerned about the longevity of the product because it runs very hot.I spent numerous hours on hold with D-Link tech support and ultimately switched back to my old, reliable Linksys WRT-54G and added a Gig-E switch to connect my fastest wired devices.  Unfortunately I went past 30 days trying to get the DIR-655 to work reliably and the return period expired.</review>

<review id="8854">I enjoyed this machine for several months and it is ok for the money.   ... couldn't wait to use it.  It was great after I got over the initial, "bowl wouldn't freeze until two days late" problem.  After we figured out that it needed to be in the Freezer longer then they stated on the manual, we kept making ice cream.Some of the problems we have came after about two months time. The ice cream will freeze to the inside of the bowl about 1/4" thick.  The scraper is plastic and is not very durable and has stopped doing the job of scraping the ice cream off the sides.The only way now is to sit over the ice cream maker with a plastic spoon and scrape the walls myself.  Sometimes the ice cream will get stuck and not move at all.This is all by following the instructions on the manual, or following instructions from Ice Cream recipe books.I am still using it, but to me, it's not as good as I would have liked it to be.</review>

<review id="8855">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)      This 2-disc Special Edition DVDs deserve negative stars.

However, the 2-disc Special Edition DVDs made me vomit.  There were no deleted scenes, no director commentary, no cast and crew interviews, etc. on the second disc.  If Kevin Smith had bought these DVDs he would tell Warner Brothers to smoke his big fat !@#$.

<review id="8856">The problem is not necessarily that the interview is not available, it's that they do not tell you that when you purchase it.  Then when you call the support line you get differing stories of when it will be available.  I purchased the program on January 2nd, to find that it did not have the interview available.  When I called support they told me it would be available on January 6th.  That was not the case.  When I called on the seventh they said it would be a few days more.  When I called on the ninth I was then informed it would be available on the 16th.  Can't they get their story straight? Don't they realize that this sort of treatment is infuriating to customers.

<review id="8858">This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)      OOh gosh...Where do I begging, this movie is perhaps the most overrated movie of 2008.Like Borat in 2006, evryone kept saying that it's the funniest movie ever, which it wasn't. I don't recall laughing at all in Borat...it was stupid and lame. Same here in Tropic Thunder, I didn't see the humor. the only joke from Stiller I found kinda funny was when the little Vietnamese kid starts hitting Stiller and he accidentally does the voice of Simple Jack...other than that..Nothing from Stiller. Downey Jr had a lot of good moments. But the whole Tom Cruise thing was way overrated. Now for those wanting to know what this movie is, or what it was trying to do was pretty much spoof on war films...unsuccessfully though. Tropic Thunder's main problem is that it tries way too hard with the jokes; every joke felt as if it was just made to chuckle...Not really laugh at. Now on the other hand Jack Black saved some parts of the movie, he gave this film what it was mainly lacking...which was humor.  So overall this is not a movie I would have in my collection, I saw it once and regretted buying it, now I have to sell it. If you are curious rent it...but if you want a good comedy watch instead Office Space, Meet the Parents or Superbad...now those movies are funny and smart. MY PERSONAL RATING: 2 OUT OF 5</review>

<review id="8861">Keurig B70 Gourmet Single-Cup Home Brewing System is just a disappointment. It has some nice features but it just doesn't make a strong enough cup of coffee if you choose to make the largest cup.

The brewing time is the same, so if it drips more water through the same amount of grounds, how can you get the same strength for the large cup of coffee?  I bought the Senseo Supreme and it's great.  You can insert 2 pods to make the large cup.</review>

<review id="8864">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      I absolutely despise this book.  The main character, Bella, is whiny, overrated, idiotic, annoying, and dramatic.  It's unbelievable that so many people like her.  I don't understand what the vampire Edward sees in her.  The only thing they have in common is that they're both boring.  All the vampires in the book are dull and lifeless, and I don't know why a bunch of damned people care about the safetly of Bella.  The only good part of the book were the werewolves, and consequently the only group that showed some life.  They were exciting where the vamps were boring, passionate where the vampires were indifferent, hot where the vampires were cold.  I don't know how Bella could leave Jake for Edward.  Overall thos whole series is completely awful, and I don't appreciare Meyer for twisting vampire lore.</review>

<review id="8866">I really want to be fair and objective, but i have to admit, this is the worst trimmer I've ever used, and I've used at least a dozen trimmers in my lifetime.- first the motor charged quickly and fine.  i was happy to have received it to trim my beard.- first I noticed the flimsy bag which was shin and would not protect the machine against bumps. the bag is worthless, and probably a step up from a thick ziplock bag but with velcro-i noticed the vacuum and quickly tried the vacuum, which can not be turned off, and the vaccum did not pull all the hair, but maybe 80% of the hair.  so in other words, the vaccum doesn't work because even if it cleaned 95%, i would still have to sweep afterwords and after i thought about it, i realized it was a waste and a stupid idea to incorporate a vaccume unless it was running on AC power with about 3AMP power to .-all this was not a big deal to be as the first and the most important to me was a trimmer that did the job, which would be the bulk of the rating.  i started running the trimmer first on my arms, which was not nearly as thick as face and noticed it was uneven after two runs.  i looked at the timmer and i see the hair just clumped on the contact point where the cutting blades meet the comb.  i cleaned it by hand and tried again.  and it kept repeating, so the bottom line after every two runs, you have to blow really hard on the comb in order to clean the path.  this is non-practical and does not satisfy the purpose for me.  [...].-also, when using the machine, i noticed i was hitting the power button, or the turbo button accidently as i shave, but i'm sure that's something i would have gotten used to do.all in all this is the worst product ever and if you really buy after reading all this, i'm not sorry for you because you didn't listen and you'll just have to return it.  if you REALLY want it, just try it at any store and tell me if you can run it across your beard, or body 4 times without cleaning it.  and when i say cleaning it, i mean blowing really hard on the comb to get the hair out.finally, even if you want to use it for close shave without the comb, you can't because of the stupid vacuum where the lid gets hair stuck in it.the vaccum is the biggest problem, so if you want a norelco trimmer, dont get the vacuum one, because it will simply render the trimmer useless.</review>

<review id="8867">Joss Whedon has indeed turned into a One Trick Pony. In every one of his works, one of the characters is stabbed with something; may it be a harpoon, a spike, sword, etc. This Whedon incarnation is just like the others. Like all his works he is unsure how to move forward so he does the only thing he  know how to do- he kills a character, this time with shrapnel. How original.

<review id="8869">This review is from: Madagascar - Escape 2 Africa (Full Screen) (DVD)      While I think the reviewer who insists the phrase "crack-a-lackin'" is somehow a racist comment (ridiculous!), I do have some issues with the subtle racism of this film. Moto-moto (voiced by a black actor) likes Gloria (voiced by a black actress) because she has a big butt. The other characters can't tell the zebras (voiced by a black actor) apart because they all look the same.  I'm surprised they didn't find a way to have these characters eat watermelon and fried chicken or something. This film has its clever moments (the first 5 or 10 minutes are completely hilarious!), but it's not nearly as good as the first. And the racism is a complete turn-off.</review>

<review id="8870">Ok, I bought this to divide my network in half so my X-Box could stream over A and my media center could stream over N and be totaly wireless.  What a disapointment.  It CONSTANTLY drops connections randomly to my Media Center, X-Box and laptops in the house.  It will not stream to Media Center because as soon as you get connected it will drop either the xbox or MC off the network.  Ok, so at least it has the FTP server built in to use with a USB drive.  The setup for this is fine but you have to reboot every other day because even though you are set to be the ADMIN of the FTP site it doesnt give you permissions to write.  You reboot and it works.  The would even be tolerable if you had the ability to reboot the think from the interface but I cant figure out how to do this so it requires a trip upstairs to manually reboot it IF I happen to be at home and need to write to it.  This product has all the right parts but the software for it has GOT to be updated to make it usable.  I am returning it to Amazon.  My $35 netgear G router worked far better.</review>

<review id="8872">Okay, so like many others, I latched onto this series because Harry Potter was over. And for a while, I absolutely adored these books, but now? I'd have put them through the paper shredder if the damn series hadn't cost me $75.What makes me mad, is that there are girls my age and older who think that these books are the best books they've ever read. They're not. All of the characters are Mary-Sues, and have no personality. (For those unfamiliar with the term, Mary-Sues are basically characters with no major flaws-- That are intentional, at least.).Edward is an abusive boyfriend, and yet there are millions of teenage girls who are 'in love' with him. It's absolutely ridiculous. Don't believe he's abusive? Search 'Edward Cullen abusive' on Google, and click on the first link.None of the Cullens have intentional personality flaws, except for Jasper. And yet he only has one. A good rounded character has several major personality flaws, not just one. Jake is creepy, and a stalker-- of course, so is Edward.Bella is apparently not exceptionally pretty; just your average girl. And yet, she has all the boys drooling at her feet. One of her /teachers/ apparently lusted after her. That sounds like a Mary-Sue if I ever heard of one. Her character had me about to claw my eyes out even when I /liked/ the books. She's so stupid! Gaah!How this ever got published, I'll never know. Girls, if you're looking for a good book, please search elsewhere. There are plenty of books with well-rounded characters and are much better written.</review>

<review id="8873">It seems this router becomes worst every day by judging from the reviews from all the users. I did not quiet believe it and thought I might be lucky. Well I was quite wrong. My old router from airlink101 is not very stable when it is heavily loaded with trafic so I want to try a router from a well-known brand this time. However with this router I am only be albe to connect one computer to the network. With same setup I have no trouble to connect all my computer 2 laptop, 2 desk top and a print server. I am unable to connect my dell and the print server to the network. When I power the Linksys down and airlink101 on, those devices have no trouble to connect to the network. Since I can connect one Gateway desktop though Linksys, I confirm the network setting is right. Somehow the other devices does not like Linksys. I can spend more time to trouble-shoot but I 'd rather return it.</review>

<review id="8874">I would actually recommend against this item.  The range on the keypad either sucks or the item itself is faulty.

Since the HDR HC9 is a next generation model using mini-dvs it is quite likely to have the same design flaw that I encountered.

<review id="8886">The Flip Video camcorder is a very cool little toy. It shoots video excellent. However, and just sharing my own personal experience, my Macbook did not recognize the camera when I plugged it into the USB port. My Macmini G4 did recognize the camera and it even showed up on the desktop but the camera's onboard software did not work. I downloaded the software from Flip video's website to my Macmini and the computer froze up every time I tried to install the software (it stalled out and I got what Mac users call "the spinning wheel of death"). Consequently, I sent the camera back to Amazon...very disappointing as I really liked the camera. Flip Video could certainly improve what is already a great product by working out the bugs on the back end...the software. Also, another improvment would be the file type in which the camera saves the video files...mpeg4 files would be great as Mac users use Quicktime and Imovie. Just as soon as those improvments are made I will gladly purchase another Flip camera</review>

<review id="8888">My hopes were very high for the Saitek AV8R. I am an aerobatics sim pilot mainly, and I thought that for a routine that I was developing for a vintage aircraft it would be good, I leaped at the oppurtunity. I got the joystick about a week later, only to hook it up and be very dissapointed.   For starters, the jostick is way too sensitive. I tried to do a roll, and it rolled 3 times before I could stop it. With my current joystick, a Logitech Extreme 3d Pro, the aircraft rolls once, in a realistic manner. If I gave the vigorous input that you'd need for aerobatics OR a combat sim, the joystick will fall on its side. It weighs somewhere in the 3/4 pound bemnchmark. You cannot fly in a combat sim, like Jetfighter, with any realism.   It may be the world's only dual throttle joystick, but don't be fooled by the picture on the box. The throttles are on the back of the stick. You can't even reach them without messing up your position of the column. The buttons on the front cannot be progmammed easily, and are also too sensitive. I found that in most sims, the only thing that they do is switch views, despite if you change the setting or not.  To sum it up, it may be good for beginners, but if you are into simming at all, then don't buy. The Logitech 3d Extreme Pro joysticks are probably the ideal for any sim;. They do not have force feedback , but the AV8R doesn't either. $45 is way too much for this joystick, $20 is too much, buying this is a mistake.</review>

<review id="8889">I bought this router today based on opinions I read here on Amazon.  Initially, a very easy setup.  That is, until I tried to configure the wireless network for it.  I'm not a newbie to wireless networking or networking in general (in fact, I managed a large CISCO-based WAN/LAN for 6 years).  No matter how I configured this router, I could not get the wireless network to stay up for more that a couple minutes at a time.  And that was when I actually was able to connect.  I tried connecting with three different machines (each with a different wireless-g adapter) that worked fine on my old wireless router.  I thought that maybe it was a security configuration issue.. disabled all encryption, same thing.  Disabled all firewall settings, same thing.  D-link's knowledgebase on this product is very poor as well.  In addition to the wireless problems, the router would also drop my wired connections every so often just for the heck of it.End result, this router goes back to Best Buy in the morning for something from a different vendor.</review>

<review id="8890">I received the coffee maker as a gift.  Although the coffee is great, the cleanup and maintenance offset any advantages of using the grinder.  The problem is that excessive condensation accumulates in the grinder during the brewing cycle, leaving a wet and sticky mess because of the residual coffee grounds in the grinder.  Although its a messy cleanup, this is a bearable problem if you don't plan on making another pot prior to an overnight air dry of the grinder.  However, if you do attempt to make another pot, then the residual moisture creates even greater problems because you cannot sufficiently dry the grinder to prevent an even greater quantity of coffee grounds from sticking in it during the next brewing cycle.  I suppose that you could use a hair dryer to thoroughly dry the grinder, but that's more trouble than its worth.  Consequently, I have gone back to using a separate grinder, thereby avoiding the messy cleanup and maintenance problems.  In short, the cleanup is much easier if you use a separate grinder.  I thus use this coffee maker with the grind feature turned off.  However, this nullifies one of its major selling points.  Thus, I would not recommend this product.</review>

<review id="8891">I would post a video review, but I can't.  I have the flip video and it works great at home.  I have the flip video software on my computer and it is very good for fast, easy, decent-quality video.I brought it with me to my parents' house in Florida and wanted to play the video on my dad's computer.  He does not have an accessible USB port (the flip video's USB connector is not long enough to reach past the trim on the computer to get to it) but he has a laptop and network.So I uploaded the videos to the laptop, then copied them over the network to his desktop.I cannot play any of the videos on his laptop.  Apparenty, after a great deal of wasted time researching this, the Flip Video uses a codec from 3ivx to compress their video.No problem, I just need to install the codec and I should be able to view the videos.Except the Flip Video pages seem to have no codec to install, and the only codec available at 3ivx's page is a commercial application that costs $$ and allows you to encode and edit videos.  I do not want to do that.I just want to view Flip Videos on my dad's computer.  I don't want to edit them with 3ivx's software, I don't want to pay to watch videos from a device that I already paid for - and most of all I wanted this to be easy.  That is the whole point of Flip Video, right?  You are't paying for a super high quality camera, you are paying for EASY with capital letters.It is really hard for me to imagine that there aren't people at Pure Digital who wince every time they read this sort of complaint and wonder why the powers that be chose to use 3ivx's codecs.  I understand that they needed a quality compression codec as part of the basic design of this device, but not to have purchased or licensed the ability to freely distribute a playback codec is inexcusable and greatly complicates using the videos at a later date.I have a gigabyte of unplayable videos of my son that his grandparents cannot watch on their computer.  That gets you one star.</review>

<review id="8892">It's funny how amazon describes these sheets as an "amazon exclusive." That must not be saying much because it's not that the sheets are sold out - it's just that they're never in stock in the first place.I ordered these sheets in April and got the 4-to-6 week waiting period. Okay, fine. But the six weeks are up, and here comes the email with "they're out of stock." Ya think?But the best part is that they've now upped the delivery to freaking SEPTEMBER! Five months for sheets? What are they doing, spinning them by hand?I'd love to get these sheets to see what they're like, but it's pretty clear that's never going to happen.

<review id="8894">I bought this router to replace a Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G I had that was going bad. I thought that would be a good time to upgrade to the world of Wireless-N. Unfortunately, I chose this router.It looks great, setup was easy, and all that jazz.Then on day 2, I couldn't get a signal. I tried everything, but nothing worked. So I rebooted the router. As soon as the router came back up, my computer connected. I thought it was just a glitch.Day 3, I couldn't get a signal. I rebooted again, and again, the signal came back.Day 4, same thing. Hmmm... I'm noticing a pattern hereAlso, part of the allure of this router was the advertised "MIMO technology uses multiple radios to create a robust signal that travels farther and reduces dead spots". The signal doesn't even reach as far as my old WRT54G did.On the bright side, however, computers that are hard wired into the ports on the back of the router work wonderfully, and have not lost signal yet. But if I wanted everything plugged into my router, I wouldn't have spent the extra on the wireless capabilities.I'd say definitely not worth buying</review>

<review id="8895">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      I really enjoyed Twilight and was more than ready to delve into New Moon, but reading it made me want to howl.  The initial book was a fresh take on vampire lore combined with teenage angst.  I admired Bella for attempting to create a new life for herself with a parent that she really hadn't developed a relationship with, in a city that she really hated, in order to foster a better relationship with her newly married, yet immature mother.  The romance with a handsome, mysterious stranger was a great plot, seeing as she didn't think that someone of his caliber could fall for someone like her, but did.  When the book ended I went right out and bought the second installment.  I am sorry I wasted the money and the time it took to find out that it was not worth it.I am apalled that SM created such an immature, vapid, self-absorbed, co-depedant 'protagonist'.  Bella's character development was abominable. Her relationships with everyone was so unhealthy and her self destructive tendencies are not something I would want any daughter of mine to emulate.  Digression not progession seemed to be the theme here.  I won't even take the time to comment in depth on Edward, Jake, or her father.  I only wish to say that each of them was clueless when it came to dealing with Bella. I wish I could say if given the third & fourth installments I would read them, but I would be lying.  I could not justify the time it would take to read something that amounts to nothing in the end. I hope that "Hostage", SM's adult novel, will not make the readers feel like one.</review>

<review id="8896">We love stories! And The Shack uses story powerfully, communicating truths in a way that lets us "get them," emotionally and intellectually. We love the laughter and intimate, loving relationships that pervade The Shack. We love the way the book faces the problem of pain; its affirmation that God is good; and the way it points out that we can trust God only to the extent that we really believe, in heart as well as head, that he's good--and that the only alternative to trusting God is sitting in judgment over God. We appreciate The Shack's affirmation that good isn't just what feels good or even what I think is good, and that evil is the absence of good and has no creative ability in itself. We love the book's emphasis on "unilateral" forgiveness, and its teaching that everything is about Jesus.But we think The Shack also presents some non-biblical views on important Christian teachings, and because they're inserted in dialogue in a novel, it's harder to examine them. We're concerned that The Shack tends to de-emphasize the role of the Bible in the life of a follower of Jesus. In The Shack, subjective impressions seem to trump Scripture as a way for God to communicate, and the Bible is almost an afterthought: "You might see me in a piece of art, or music, or silence, or through people, or in Creation, or in your joy and sorrow. My ability to communicate is limitless, living and transforming, and it will always be tuned to Papa's goodness and love. And you will hear and see me in the Bible in fresh ways. Just don't look for rules and principles; look for relationship--a way of coming to be with us" (198).Another passage almost seems to ridicule the Bible:"In seminary [Mack] had been taught that God had completely stopped any overt communication with moderns, preferring to have them only listen to and follow sacred Scripture, properly interpreted, of course. God's voice had been reduced to paper, and even that paper had to be moderated and deciphered by the proper authorities and intellects. . . . Nobody wanted God in a box, just in a book. Especially an expensive one bound in leather with gilt edges, or was that guilt edges?" (65).The author may simply be ridiculing the misuse of the Bible, but because these are his primary references to the Bible, the overall effect seems to point away from Scripture, toward subjective impressions. The Bible claims to be not just one among many ways we hear our Lord, but the way by which we measure all other ways. The primary way we have of telling whether the voice within is the Holy Spirit, our own idea, or the voice of the enemy of our souls, is to check what we're hearing against the Bible's teachings. We think this casual attitude toward the Bible is found throughout the book. To give just one example, The Shack seems to implicitly teach universalism, the belief that everyone will eventually end up in heaven. Papa tells Mack that she is now fully reconciled to the whole world, not just to those who believe in her (192). Later, Papa tells Mack that he has forgiven all humans, and that "when you forgive someone you certainly release them from judgment" (225). Mack asks Papa: "But if you are God, aren't you the one spilling out great bowls of wrath and throwing people into a great lake of fire?" (119) She answers, ambiguously, "it's not my purpose to punish [sin]; it's my joy to cure it" (120). Sophia tries to get Mack to choose three of his children to spend eternity in hell, saying:I am only asking you to do something that you believe God does. He knows every person ever conceived. . . . He loves each one. . . . You believe he will condemn most to an eternity of torment, away from His presence and apart from His love. Is that not true? (162) Mack can't choose, of course, and ultimately volunteers to take his children's place in hell. Sophia's response? "Now you know Papa's heart, who loves all his children perfectly" (163). God's heart is indeed to take our place, through Jesus's death, but The Shack sidesteps the question of what happens to those who don't avail themselves of it. Sophia's implied teaching doesn't seem to square with the consistent teaching of the New Testament that Jesus will come, "dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. And these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power." (2 Thess. 1.6-10) We don't enjoy what the Bible says about hell and the wrath of God. We find it a hard and painful teaching--but it does seem clear to us that it's a biblical teaching. It would seem strange that Jesus himself would warn us so often about hell, if it weren't a real possibility. Scripture tells us to test what people say: "Do not stifle inspiration, and do not despise prophetic utterances, but bring them all to the test and then keep what is good in them and avoid the bad of whatever kind" (1Thess. 5.19-22). We encourage you to examine all of The Shack's teachings in the light of the Bible.We think The Shack's stance toward God's wrath and coming judgment is important in itself, and even more important as an indication of the book's general attitude toward Scripture. When we stop clinging to the Bible as a God-breathed document, we lose the only objective standard we have against which to measure ourselves and our world, and we end up like Israel in the time of the judges: "In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (Judges 21.25).</review>

<review id="8904">I have had this for a couple of days and within hours noticed a severe problem with the router. It constantly (dozens of times daily) drops connections. This is happening over the wired network and was not an issue with the previous D-Link router. After researching online, I learned that the router is overheating. I use gigabit for most of my network and fear that it just can't cope with the speed. Under even moderate loads, it will disconnect ever few minutes. This is wholly unacceptable and raising the box to allow more airflow didn't help. Copy any large file over the internet or across the network and the connection will drop - guaranteed. This is especially annoying when using remote desktop since it reconnects every 5-10 minutes when the connection drops. I haven't tried wireless yet, but other comments online point to the problem existing there as well. The long and short of it is that I will be returning this shortly and am thoroughly disapointed with it.</review>

<review id="8905">The series has suffered a steady slide into the toliet and it began near the end of season 2. For a while I kept watching by telling myself that the next episode couldn't possibly be as bad as the one I just finished watching...then the next one ends up being worse. It got to the point where I would watch half the episode, then fast forward through the rest to see if there was anything worth watching...and there never was. The show has been allowed to become a bad soap opera...nothing makes much sense and there is absolutely no "re-watch" value for any of the season 3 or 4 episodes. Plot holes exist and they are so large that you could send the BSG through them. The writers are either lazy, incompetent, or both. To compound this, the editing is terrible too. There is a reason why ratings for BSG have reportedly crashed through the basement(which is why they decided to end it). My advice is to definitely check out the original mini-series (best episodes of the series)and season 1 & 2. Whatever you do, do NOT waste your money(or minutes of your life) on seasons 3 & 4. Btw, so far, the final season has descended into previously unexplored levels of the sewer.</review>

<review id="8906">I purchased "Waterpik Ultra Dental Jet 100WP" in Sept. I used the small toothbrush that came w/it one time when 1st got it, put it aside, then several weeks later I decided to use it again..As I used it The small bristles came out in my mouth, the toothbrush had broken into 2 pieces,one large piece & one small section. I was concerned that was a definite HEALTH HAZARD, I emailed the company with my concerns they didn't respond so I called the company spoke to a Secretary she said will pass it along to her superior "if he is concerned he will contact me" He NEVER returned my call I would NOT/do-NOT recommend this product & to add to that it leaks. Am satisified that it does preform well but the health hazard & lack of concern of the company bigwig bothers me greatly.</review>

<review id="8908">Like the vast majority of slow cookers, this cooks too hot.  It boiled the food on low.  A four pound roast (VERY thick) was beyond well-well-done after 5 hours.  On the other hand, I see the reviewer below who said it didn't cook fast enough on high, and the other reviewer who said the high and low settings are switched.  I find that hard to believe, but it is worth checking out.  I'll let you know what I find...  UPDATE:  On mine, high and low are NOT switched.  But they are about the same temperature.  I just did a cold water test using low only, and in less than 3 hours it is over 200 degrees (low should be around 170).  High setting did the same thing.  I would pay double the price if they would make this exact crockpot that WORKS CORRECTLY.  Rival, are you listening???</review>

After two weeks I got it back. Three weeks after that the same problem happenned again. I asked for a replacement, since it died twice in two months, but was told that was not an option.

<review id="8912">I bought the Newborn size of this SwaddleMe and it was still too large for my daughter.  It was much easier to use a regular blanket.  I agree with the other moms...it does tend to get up into the baby's face.  I ended up folding it down to about half way down her shoulders.  But it was just too big and didn't make her cozy enough to be considered "swaddled."  Not worth the money.</review>

<review id="8914">Microsoft Office Professional 2007 UPGRADEI have been using computers for over 45 five years and PC's for the past 25.  I recently upgraded from MS Office 2003 to 2007 (professional) for use on my home computer.  Over the years I have progressed from various minicomputer report generators, word processors and PC based word processors.  There is always a certain amount of learning with the upgrading process, but I am totally disgusted with some of the changes in Officer 2007.  I use all of the components of the package (Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint), but am most concerned with Word, especially for anyone in a business environment where time, deadlines and money are important considerations.  Some of my concerns are with the new interface.  It is almost impossible to locate many of the features that are required to prepare a simple letter or report.  Yes, they have supplied a lot of interactive help and it is great for kids and geeks in learning mode, but very slow and frustrating for a mature user that is really only interested in getting the job done!  I just completed trying to edit a report and it is so bad that I am going to the office and use the old machine!  Another example is with the importing of scanned material into a document or report.  It use to be a very simple process of importing directly from a the scanner and now there is a whole new separate system that requires going out of word, importing the material from the scanner into clip organizer and clipping back into work.   It is a horrible and inconvenient system that is a poor substitute for the old approach.  I will not pretend to have a complete understanding of the 2007, but these are a few things that I notice.  My real concern is that anyone in the business world should look long and hard at making the change as the loss in productivity while learning to use the new system will very high.  Now having stated that side of the problem I am certain that there will be a reverse effect when starting employees from secondary schools and college come into the organization they will feel most comfortable with the new product, given that Microsoft gives them the most recent material for free.  You can't win on this one.  Microsoft needs to go back to the drawing board on this one!</review>

<review id="8915">Although the documentation says that you can stop this product from broadcasting the SSID the option is not available when you try to do it.  Netgear support has confirmed this is a problem and said that it is releasing new firmware but can't confirm the date.  This is a very basic security feature that should be available on all wireless routers.  I would not purchase until new firmware is released.</review>

<review id="8916">This was a gift for my new grandbaby.  I had to wash it before giving it to her because it had a funny odor.  It didn't wash up very soft either.  I still prefer a good soft flannel blanket for swaddling.  When buying it, I was not aware of the Made in China factor, but it was a learning experience.</review>

<review id="8917">I carry a lot of these drives around because I am constantly on the go and I run several businesses. I have another SanDisk that slides the usb key which  works perfectly and is very easy to use. I don't know if I got a bum key but this one STINKS! The problem is every time I go to insert it into the usb port it pushes the darn thing back into its case! I can spend 10 minutes trying to get it just right so it finally inserts. My wife got a great deal on the drive and was so excited so I don't have the heart to tell her its flawed. I should soon though because I see they do have a 4gb in the other model. This design is pointless to me because the other one works just as well and isn't that fancy.Bottom line, SanDisk makes quality stuff but this design is not worth it.</review>

<review id="8918">There's a reason why this book, in comparison to Twilight and Eclipse, is getting less five stars.  This book has no exciting moments, and you'll just get irritated with Jacob and get even more irritated of Edward because he has transformed differently from the guy that you have fallen in love with in the first book.  Spare yourselves a trip to the library or the bookstore or to an online store.  If you want to stay positive about this series, just stick to Twilight and stop right there.  Good memories are better having than the regrets that will come after reading the last two, maybe three, books.</review>

<review id="8920">I bought the HP Mini 1035 two days ago because I wanted a lightweight computer that I could travel with, and do basic work and email on. I love the size, the keyboard is easy to type on, so it seemed like the perfect little machine...However, I couldn't connect to the wireless connection in my apartment (Mac wireless router). After two hours on the phone with HP support, they told me to call Mac, saying it must be a problem with the router. Mac support explained that this mini notebook probably wasn't WPA compatible, which is a newer wireless standard technology. It's only WEP compatible (older wireless technology). The only way I could connect wirelessly was to change my Mac router settings so that my wireless connection isn't secure -- meaning any of my neighbors in the area could latch on to my connection. I live in NYC, I have a LOT of neighbors. When I called HP back to ask them about this -- to find out if this truly was a WPA vs. WEP issue -- it took more than FOUR hours on the phone with them before they finally admitted that this machine isn't WPA compatible. They just kept trying to problem-solve by telling me how I could adjust the security on my router. At one point they CONFERENCED IN the Mac support people so Mac could explain the "perfect settings" for me to be on to be wireless on my mini. The Mac people were basically laughing saying that they don't recommend being on a not-secure connection. I finally got an HP tech person to admit that they know that this is a problem and that they're not supposed to address it. They don't make a mini right now with the WPA technology. WPA is the standard at Starbucks, hotels, airports, basically everywhere. What is the point of having this tiny little computer that you can take everywhere, if you're not going to be allowed to access the wireless networks? I find it crazy that I had to call the Mac people to get to the bottom of my HP problem. I'm returning this computer tomorrow and am going to try and find a mini that's up to WPA. If not, I'm going to have to wait until they catch up. I DO NOT recommend the HP Mini unless you don't care about having a secure wirelss connection in your home. Or if you don't intend to log on wirelessly from other locations.</review>

<review id="8923">Hmmm.  I don't know that I'd buy this one again.  I got it home, didn't read anything, didn't put any discs in, put it behind my Motorola cable modem, cloned my Mac's MAC address, and it more-or-less worked off the bat.  You know a few resets but mostly I think it was the modem's fault.I got it set up.  DHCP with some reservations for two machines.  Wired to my Apple TV, Wireless to a G5, PowerBook G4, Intel MBP, 2 Airport Expresses (in bridge mode just to stream music to them), and my iPhone.  Seems great.Everytime you change your port forwarding, it's a modem restart though.  In fact anytime you change any configuration, it's a modem restart.  It's horrible.  Granted you don't do it alot, but occasionally I'll need to poke a hole in my firewall to let FTP in or what not.  Bringing down my internet connection to do it is a bundle of suckage.Worse though, connections are dropping.  My G5 hasn't dropped yet, but the PB and MBP are dropping a lot.  The logs only say "kernel: WLAN: MLME - Disconnecting (deauth) wireless client: ffffffffffff Reason 3" but without referring to the client with a MAC address or something I can't be sure what's dropping and why.  I'll give dlink a call about this next week.So would I buy this again, probably not.  Are there better out there, who knows.</review>

<review id="8924">I have had my Chi for about a year now. And it worked wonders on my hair. I have really thick wavy hair and had a really cheap straightener that took me an hour just to do my hair. I was told about the Chi and of course went and bought it. Now a year later it just won't turn on. Sure i have dropped a few times but still. For paying over a $100 you would think it would last longer then a year!?! Now I am debating whether to buy a new one or not. By the way my mom has the same exact Chi and though she got her's a couple of months before I got mine she is having the same problem.

<review id="8927">I was not a fan of this book.  Through the entire series, I've felt that Meyer uses 20 words when 2 will do - and this book felt just bloated and way too long.  Although finally it was interesting to get a second point of view besides Bella's, there was no real action at all in this book.  All of it was anticipation.  And I agree that it was a complete Cop Out for Jacob to imprint on the baby.Honestly, I think the first one worked so well because it was all angsty teen forbidden love.  Even the second book was interesting because it dealt with something that the target audience could relate to - breaking up and feeling like your world ends.  But once Meyer went to the "myth" of all those extra vampires and Italian judges, etc., it felt like she got lost and had to find a way out.And was anyone else annoyed that there was no real fighting in the book?  There are so many comparisons of Meyer to JK Rowling and I have to completely disagree.  Rowling is a much better author, and she's mature enough to know that happily ever after doesn't mean everything gets wrapped up in a pretty bow - I mean, half the cool characters died in HP7.  Finally, I still would like to know what the appeal of Bella is.  Again, in the first book she was interesting, but she got less so as the books went on.I'm sorry that this book was not as good as I'd hoped it would be.  Kind of want my money back.</review>

<review id="8929">This is a nice, small, inexpensive hub with clear instructions. Unfortunately, it does not seem to work with Macs as advertised. When I tried to use it with my iMac G5, it would not work with powered USB devices (hp laser printer, powerwave, and ipod). My camera's download cable worked OK, but I didn't buy the hub just to plug one device in. I found a web page online that suggested other Mac users have had this problem with the hub. But neither the D-Link web site nor the Apple web site included any information about the problem I had.</review>

<review id="8930">I bought this for playing World of Warcraft and I'm going to have to get a better headset. This one is comfortable enough for extended play, and the sound quality is good, but the primary reason I bought it was because I needed a microphone as well for talking with my friends while playing.

<review id="8931">I was going to upgrade from Quick books Pro 2005 to 2009 but after reading the reviews I have decided to look at other accounting programs.  I must say that I have used Quick books for many years and have purchased many upgrades.  I have ALWAYS been unhappy with Intuit's customer service.The version I have now is glitchy.  When I try to create invoices or accept payments, the program often tells me the customer is inactive and asks if I would like to make it active.Intuit obviously does not realize just how serious we business people are about our money.  In other words the safety and integrity of the accounting of our money.We can not and will not use any program, accountant, or bank that is unstable or problematic.</review>

<review id="8932">I'm having trouble understanding how people could be raving about how great this blender is.  It is nice-looking, and I don't care that it only has two speeds.

<review id="8933">This item (Omron HEM-650) is difficult to use.  It has to be lined up just right in a certain location near the heart and the elbow held in place with your other hand, to avoid movement.  In that odd position it's no wonder you have to hold on.  In my view this device is definitely not designed with people in mind, especially older folks. This is not a simple strap on and start device, as most others are.  For that reason alone I would not rate it with any stars at all, if given that option.</review>

<review id="8934">I got my fabulous eee pc 901.  It booted right up hooked to my wireless and was seemingly amazing.  The next day it wouldn't boot anymore.  It said to hit F2 or Tab.  The Asus tech support folks were NOT helpful at all. The were super rude and annoyed that I couldn't find the reset hole that is completely buried under a somewhat permanent sticker. That reset didn't help anyway.  They told me that if I only had a CD/DVD drive then I could boot it from the start up disk and restore it.  Turns out they lied.  That only works if the computer responds to the tab key to put me in the bios.  Anyway Amazon was shipping me another one but of course it isn't going to be here before my trip and that was the whole point of getting one.  So far my experience with Amazon and the Eee PC are far from stellar.  Sigh.  I hope you all have better luck than I have.</review>

<review id="8937">I have never had this much trouble with a computer product. I've owned this model for a couple years, and the first year went fairly smooth after finally getting it set up properly. The past few months have been filled with the router working off and on. Technical support is pretty much worthless considering it takes forever to talk to semi-English speaking people and they ask repetitive questions after I've given them the answer several times. I feel like putting my head through a wall after getting off tech support with these people. In any case, I have done multiple resets in recent weeks. After each reset the router will work for a few hours then quit working. I call tech support and go through the same procedure time after time. I'm still under warranty yet even after spending many hours on tech support the company is not going to repair it. They keep putting through the same useless procedure. I've had it and am going to just buy another brand of router and hope for the best. Incidentally, we had three really nice Linksys routers at work and they ALL crapped out within a year, so I am not feeling too good about this company's products. A friend of mine warned me about Linksys routers back when I bought mine, and now I know why.</review>

<review id="8938">So I got this as a Christmas gift and nobody really knows how much I hate the thing. Why anybody would want one of these is beyond me.  You have exactly 2 choices.  Option number one is click forward or reverse until you find the song that you want to hear, on a 1GB mp3 player that holds somewheres around 256 songs, you could be clicking up to 128 times (if the given song you want to hear is at the furthest point from where you currently are and if I am really good at math).  Your other option is shuffle.  Hence the genius name iPod shuffle. "iPod shuffle" does sound better than "iPod press forward a hundred times". The other thing that really sucks is the difficulty involved in just adding a song. Its not like a normal mp3 player, where you just open the folder after you plug it in a click and drag songs in. No, you have to use iTunes and have an iLibrary and stuff. What a hassle, I just wanted to add a couple songs before I went out. Whats with all this work involved, "No I don't want to update iTunes now I have a job to go to." Sometimes I just want to add a song or change something around real quick but its impossible. This whole process is nearly as time consuming as going to the DMV. On the plus side the iPod shuffle comes in a variety of different colors to match the sweater vest you probably put on your dog.</review>

<review id="8939">You thought drinking orange juice after you freshly brushed your teeth left a bad taste in your mouth? Apparently you haven't experienced The Secret. Taste is a bad analogy as it implies harmlessness. Rather, reading this book (or watching the DVD for that matter) is akin to having your eyes carved out with rusty spoons. It is patronizing, insulting to the intelligence of anything more intellectually inclined than a tortoise. Actually that's being somewhat insulting to the tortoise. Its written simply, in the most bulleted, childish, infomercial-ist way possible. Basically, the WORST get-rich-quick scheme I've ever seen. And so conspiracy-esque that I wouldn't be surprised to see Tom Cruise show up in the credits, partnered with M. Night Shamylan. And ... my favourite claim of the novel is, by far, the idea that non-Western cultures are poor and disadvantaged simply because they have not had the audacity to pick up and read Byrne's book. A little harsh don't you think?Please don't waste your money ... you're better off buying Paris Hilton's book - this one makes her look like the next Salman Rushdie.</review>

<review id="8941">I am sorry I have to give the Asus EEE PC two stars.  I was equally sorry that I had to return it!  In some ways, it is not the computer's fault.  It is small, and I wanted something I could easily take on trips.  It was also reliable, and inexpensive.  But in the end, it didn't work out.  The keys are so small and cramped that I found myself avoiding answering emails and composing a document was out of the question. Further, the screen is so small,that I found I was constantly tweaking webpages so I could read the content.  Asus, if you could make a laptop that was equally light, inexpensive, and reliable as the pc eee--and make the keyboard and the screen bigger, I would be an enthusiastic customer!</review>

<review id="8943">Very uneven and inconsistant. One side is not toasted at all, while the edges of the other side are burnt. A setting of "4" on one day is fine (for one side anyway) but the next day sets the bread on fire. Never have gotten a slice of toast with both sides the same.</review>

<review id="8944">I am so disappointed in this toaster from Kitchen Aid, usually known for good quality.  In less then a year of very moderate use, we are down to ONE out of four slots working.

<review id="8945">I love the idea of this collar. Problem is that it doesn't work properly. I have only seen it spray my dog once which was very effective at getting her to stop barking. However, it hasn't sprayed her since that first time, despite her continuous barking. I am unable to make it spray me no matter what kind of noises I make. My husband can get it to spray if he holds it "just right". Her barking is so disturbing that I am going to have to try some more drastic measures. My only advice to you is DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</review>

<review id="8946">This was an excruciatingly difficult piece of equipment to set up.The menus for setting the security settings were confusing and locked me out of the network.  Even after pushing the reset button I couldn't get in.  The package claims 7/24 tech support, but I couldn't find a phone number in any of the included paperwork, or on the package.  I guess you need internet access to get the toll free number. The setup software was useless. I have had other wireless devices before that were much easier to set up, including Belkin and Westell devices.  If you only have advanced computer skills, and if you don't have IT people at your disposal, I would recommend avoiding this device.</review>

<review id="8947">I just took this out of the box and right away could see that it was not going to work.  The motor part that turns the pan is plastic.  The pan does not fit onto the plastic piece.  The pan just sits there with a lot of play back and forth.  The worst of it, the dough hook does not fit securely onto the knob in the pan.  I had my last breadmaker for 8 years, and if not for the part my husband washed down the sink I would still be using it.  This product is not worth carrying home.</review>

The real issue started with the fact that Windows is installed on a drive with only 4gb of space, and it needs about 3gb. This steamrolled into more and more problems as I ran out of space on C very quickly. This product is terrible. I bought it to have something "easy" to use. I don't care if it's fast, powerful, cool. I just needed something that was "easy" to take around with me. Instead, I have a small pain in my backside. Don't buy this product.</review>

<review id="8951">This router was very easy to setup.  Its web-based interface was easy to understand, although you need to tweak the MAC address you send upstream if you are connected to a cable modem.  From a feature perspective, this router provides all of the essential wireless ones---a built-in firewall, MAC address filtering (which allows you to choose specific computers that are allowed to connect), SSID broadcast enable/disable (an invisible Wi-Fi network is more secure), and decent access logs.When using WEP encryption (which is outdated), this router performs fairly well.  Also, the 4 LAN ports work reliably and well.  However, when I downloaded the WPA firmware upgrade, my router changed significantly.  WPA connections are much slower, due to the encryption.  More importantly, WPA connections have a tendency to freeze the router, requiring you to push the reset button in the back (unplugging the router won't work).  To be fair, I have the older v1 of this router (there are at least 6 versions of this router, newer versions are labeled WGR614v2, WGR614v3 and so on), for which the only firmware update is labeled as beta.  Nonetheless, this renders the wireless router useless to me.</review>

<review id="8952">BORING. It was predictable, comparatively slow paced and shmaltzy. Why didn't Meyer trust us with a tragedy? Something that would ground this book a bit more. Less Mormon white-picket fence, live-for-eternity-making-babies, no-one's-sad crap?Very disappointing.She got two stars because she had credit left over from the first two books. Her plot genius and setting was wonderful. The characters could be a little more interesting, like have a life beyond each other (so at the Pearly Gates will Meyer be asked about her responsibility in producing a generation of co-dependent relationships?) or even one, just one, independent, intelligent thought, but it was a ride and a good one and the entertainment value high.</review>

<review id="8953">At first it worked fine. I had two pcs (wired) & an Xbox, (wireless). For a month or two everything was fine. Then I began to get disconnected or was unable to connect. Powering off and on the router or cable modem usually got it working again. Then it just wouldn't connect any more no matter what I did. Finally got fed up and replaced it with a Linksys WRT54G. I immediately got good connections with everything. It has been working fine ever since. Netgear looks nice, vertical stand takes up less desk space, and it's fairly cheap. But it doesn't work! Unless you need a paperwight avoid Netgear!!</review>

<review id="8954">I have two linksys routers, one wireless g, and the other cabled. Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best. When that happens i have to restart my pc or restart the linksys router. Both routes take me a few minutes of precious time when i would be online doing something important.Stay away from this junk. Do your research and buy something like netgear or dlink.</review>

<review id="8955">It seems that the stars need to line up correctly to get this ice cream maker to function properly. When it does work, it is great. But getting the freezer bowl to freeze is not always easy. If your freezer is too full, too empty, too old, etc, you may have some difficulty. When I bought this, I planned to just leave my freezer bowl in the freezer all the time so I could make ice cream whenever I wanted it. But about half the time, my freezer bowl was not completely frozen. I would have to move it somewhere else in the freezer and wait another day and if I was lucky, it would be frozen. Maybe it was just my freezer causing the problem, but it was a pain.If it is too warm outside and your freezer bowl defrosts too quickly, you don't get ice cream, just slightly frozen mush. I reccommend going with the regular ice and rock salt machines. If you need to add more ice, you can. You aren't stuck with a freezer bowl that might not be frozen enough or defrosts to quickly.</review>

<review id="8956">Brief background... I'm a networking geek. Yup, set up a network with DMZ, many subnets, routers, firewalls, bridges. At uni I was an Network Security professional, I've worked for CISCO, now I work for one of the worlds largest telco's with wireless networks.I bought this device to extend part of my network. Yes, this device is easy to set up. But give it three wireless users authenticated based on MAC and allocated IP addresses, with 128bit WEP, shared key, then apply small ammount of traffic and the wireless connection drops... dead. 100BaseTx users can continue to use the net, but signal strenght on wireless connections drop from 68-84 down to 0 !!! I.e. the wireless connection dies. And tech support can hardly read their script, they are incapable and outright lie about basic network principles when challanged.Quite a few people have written reviews about this same problem, some have even had their routers replaced... but I feel it is my duty to inform you and save you the headache in case you do get one of these faulty routers.</review>

<review id="8958">This video is certainly for advanced DANCERS!  Tracy provides so little instruction that it is just frustrating.  You just have to keep up, she give no instruction on how to position you body-it is left to you to try to figure it out.  She is very dull and seems bored.  Her expression rarely changes at all during the entire boring DVD.  If you are not a dancer, don't get this DVD.  It would be fine if she actually taught you how to dance and do the moves but she doesn't.  This is by far the worst workout video I have ever purchased.  If you are looking for motivation or inspiration any way, this is not for you.</review>

<review id="8961">360 is a complete protector for my computers, but I could kill my husband for purchasing this version over regular Norton Security or Antivirus.

<review id="8962">Purchased the Flip camera.  Good price, decent little 'throw away' camera.  Decent value.  That being said, expect what you pay for.  With this inexpensive camera, you don't get good quality shots, you don't get good sound, you don;t get a decent zoom (take 3 steps closer and you pretty much duplicated its zoom capabilities).  DO NOT GET IT IF YOU HAVE A MAC/APPLE.   It says that its software works on both Mac and PC, but it doesn't.  The video transfers over easily, but the sound is all gabled and not usable.  We have to put it on a PC, then burn them to a disc, then upload the disc to the Mac.  Anyway, it's a decent little one to leave in your backpack or purse or car, but don't rely on it to capture important events.</review>

<review id="8964">After taking this product for two weeks I noticed that I would get a headache everyday at the same time (evening). I think it may be a side effect of the caffeine in the product, but definitely think it IS the Hydroxycut Hardcore. I am eating healthy and working out 3-4 times a week. While there is a significant energy boost which helps with workouts, it is not enough for me to deal with the terrible headaches if I continue taking it. Therefore, I will not buy this product again! Just know that this product is not for everyone. I'm on my search for something better.</review>

<review id="8965">Well, I've bought a WRT54G and a WPC54G notebook adapter to have a nice, fast wireless connection to my desktops connected directly to fast ethernet. However, since the begining, I have problems to keep the connection up and running, I've updated firmware on WRT54G and notebook drivers. But it's getting worse. In certain moment, my notebook stopped to connect at all, so I've contacted Linksys support to get directions. They sent me a new notebook driver package (that seems to be different from one available to download, it's XP certified) and I've been able to reconnect. However, connections don't last more than 4 minutes, even if I'm seeing WRT54G. I'm gonna return it, but I'm really frustrated, after 4 Linksys routers I've bought in the past with 100% satisfaction, this wireless router disappointed me big.</review>

<review id="8967">Based on the reviews I purchased 2 of these, one for my mother-in-law and one for me.  I found them very easy to set up and use.  However, my mother-in-law's systolic pressure would run 10-15 points low on this monitor as checked against her doctor's results, and at age 88 this is her most important reading.  Both of my numbers would vary by 10-15 points in either direction compared to an arm unit that had been calibrated at a doctor's office.  I liked the units and found them easy to use but the readings were so erratic as to be unusable, so I have returned both.</review>

<review id="8968">I am currently taking a religion class and wanted some background on the subject, as a result, I bought this dvd. I should have left it in the store. This is all fluff and has NO value as a piece of scholarship whatsoever. Bill Maher walks in to this project with a bias and it shows in the finished product. If he does not agree with a particular view of a guest, he will shut him down by talking over him/her and not allowing the individual to get ideas across. In one piece, he gets up and walks out of the interview. Conversely, if he does agree with a person'w views, he will let them speak.At times, it is humourous, but this detracts from what should be deeper subject. He preaches to those who already do not beleive in religion or those on the fence and are not sure. But since it is basically the rantings of a nonbeliever and in a Hollywood-type setting, the documentary has no value in the battle between those who believe and those who do not.A better approach to this material would have been a debate between religious leaders and atheists like Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hutchins with Maher as the moderator.In the end, this is a juvenile and inadequate approach to this subject that lacks any merit. I will chuck my copy in a fire that no one has to be subjected to this garbage.Do yourself a favor and avoid this documentary (and I use the term very loosely) at all costs.</review>

<review id="8969">Bought mine from a local retailer -- seemed great at first, but spontaneously drops traffic every so often for no reasons what so ever.

<review id="8970">I was always a loyal fan to the first three books of the series, but sadly this fourth installment did not meet my high expectations. While reading Breaking Dawn, I couldn't help but feel as if Stephenie Meyer was on drugs, there's no better way to put it. Everything you thought would never happen...happened. It felt as if she was just writing this to make the fans "happy." Unfortunately, for this fan at least, she completely missed the mark. If you must read this book, borrow a copy from a friend.</review>

<review id="8972">I got the Sansa M250 for Christmas.  It was really neat at first.  It was neat to just plug it in and be able to drag and drop.  I ended up having no choice but to use the included headphones because my well-broken in ones from high school finally died.  The little cover that was included was alright, but the arm-band was goofy.  It didn't adjust well to my arm at all.  Anyway, everything was good until the second day I had it.  I listened to it on the way to work and put it in my purse inside my locker.  I wanted my boyfriend to hear Patti Smith's cover of "Because the Night" when he picked me up from work, so I turned on the mp3 player, and waited, and waited, and guess what.  It wouldn't get past the welcome screen.  This is alright.  I realize about 10% of all new electronics are doomed to fail.  But then I called customer service.  First off, there's no choice in their automated menu for the M series Sansa.  So I just picked one of the other choices and hoped for the best.  I was directed to a representative who could barely speak English (thank you, outsourcing), and I was really surprised she even knew what a computer is.  Upon explaining my situation to her, she told me it was because I wasn't using the correct operating system (which has nothing to do with it; this all happened a whole day after the last time I loaded songs onto it, and I was able to do so using ME as well as 2000 on a different computer, by the way).  Sadly, I packed up all of the stuff that was included with the player, and sent it back to my Dad to send back, and decided that, alone, the Sansa's failure would have been okay; I could just get a new one, but because of the crappy tech support, I didn't want another Sansa.  I just got the Creative MUVO V100 2GB today.  It doesn't come with a carrying case, and it doesn't have an FM tuner, but it feels much sturdier and looks a lot nicer than the Sansa.  I'm still waiting for the two day mark though, to see if this one craps out on me, too, but somehow, I don't think it will.</review>

<review id="8973">Norton 360 V2.0 was easy to install and worked as advertised. However it slowed my computer to a crawl with all its features enabled. I find myself turning off Norton often because of the lack of speed. I am running Windows XP with SP3 and 512M of Ram on a Pentium IV 1.8 Ghz Dell.I would not purchase this product again.</review>

<review id="8974">It's a marvellous little player; when it actually works. The problem is, I had three of these stop working when they got stuck on the Sansa opening screen or the Initialising process. The first time it happened within the first day, the two other times it took about a month for the player to crash and get stuck in this deadly loop that makes it so that the computer won't recognize the player anymore because it can't communicate with it.The store was kind enough to exchange the product twice and now I will ask for a store credit. Read a lot of reviews and user opinion forums about your different options before buying a player; it will be time well spent.Edit: I got yet another replacement a few months ago with a more recent firmware and it's been working fine ever since. The player freezes sometimes, but it is solved with a few reboots. The new firmware adds features that was lacking, like playing an album in the numerical order that is programmed in the ID3 tags. Four stars ****.</review>

<review id="8981">DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. ITEM.  This heart rate monitor stopped working within 2 weeks.  Yes, I read the reviews from others complaining of the poor batteries shipped with the device.  So, I was actually prepared for the heart rate moniter (HRM) to fail and I would replace the batteries and 'all would be good'.  Sure enough, the HRM stopped working within 2 weeks.  I replaced the batteries in the watch and the chest strap and it worked just one more time.  Even in its last use, I was skeptical of the heart rate it was displaying.For a product that does not have any moving parts, it speaks to poor quality when it fails that quickly. Please save your money, time and sanity and avoid this product.</review>

<review id="8984">In this day and age when almost all portable electronic products are universal power based, I regret to inform you that the Norelco Trimmers are mono voltage and cannot be operated outside the US. The unit can be charged only from (110v /120V).  Neither the Philips nor the Amazon websites point this out to buyers.Since I travel outside of the US quite a bit, it is a big hassle to use this trimmer with a voltage converter.  I wish Philips would seriously consider this issue and improve on the product, hence two star rating.</review>

<review id="8985">When my wife and I first bought this popcorn maker, it seemed terrific -- made it easier to make popcorn, although it was a bit of a pain to clean.  But yesterday, my wife used it and noticed that something was wrong with the first batch of popcorn.  When she tried another batch, the oil inside CAUGHT FIRE!!  Apparently, the plastic on the lid had deformed and started to melt.Needless to say, we won't be buying this popper again.</review>

<review id="8986">I owned this POS for a week or two before selling it on craigslist.  So why did I hate this machine so much?  I'm glad you asked.First, the coffee it makes is variable in quality and depends entirely on how clean all of the removable parts are.  Since you have to clean all of the parts after every use in order to have a consistent cup of coffee at your next brew, you get to spend a lot of time with your coffeemaker and waste a lot of hot water cleaning the cheap, plastic parts.  Unless you have eagle vision, you really have no idea exactly how much water you are pouring into the reservoir, because there's no external gauge.  I suppose you could use a measuring cup, but then I imagine you would ask yourself how ridiculous it is that you need to measure your coffee water because your coffeemaker's maker is an idiot.I feel I need to warn you about the truly terrifying sounds the grinder makes.  It sounds not unlike a single-engine plane at full throttle and hovering outside your kitchen window.  I'm aware that airplanes do not hover, but the imaginative sadists at Cuisinart didn't think so, and they thought you'd like to wake up to the soothing sounds of aircraft in the morning.  What's worse is that it actually gets louder as the grind continues.  It rises like a siren to an irritating pitch, and then, having awakened your neighbors three doors down, it finally dies and you can uncover your ears and cautiously approach to make sure it won't yell at you anymore.  I own a stand-alone Cuisinart grinder, and I'm aware that grinding coffee beans is a loud process, but the decibel level this coffeemaker can reach is utterly intolerable.I found the 1-4 cup "smart" feature ironic since it made horrid, thin coffee.  I didn't realize how tall the machine was; you'll need more than the 17 inches under your cabinets if you want to open the machine to clean the parts.All in all, I'm not sure this coffeemaker could have had a worse design.  Really, I can't think of anything.  Everything terrible is already included.</review>

<review id="8989">Pretty much all of the awful aspects of this book have been discussed thousands of times...so I'm going to keep this simple.  The characters were, well...completely out of character.  Half the characters seemed to do a complete 180, and not even in a good way, and some (like Rosalie) were still one-dimensional characters even after four books.  It didn't flow at all with the rest of the series.  It was really terribly written, and SM has once again proved to us that she needs a thesaurus.  Everything was wrapped up in a neat little bow at the end, so it was extremely anti-climactic with little to no conflict.  "Oh my god the Volturi is going to kill us!  ALL OF US!  Oh wait, nvm".  Stephenie Meyer's excuse for not explaining pivotal plot twists (such as...you know, how the hell Bella got preggers from a guy that's technically been dead for 90 years) in the book were that she's going to explain it in the stupid guide thing that she's publishing in December, which is basically saying "I'm shamelessly ripping off the Harry Potter series!".  Her universe is not nearly comprehensive enough to need a guide.  Really terrible choice.  We all know the Twilight series is not a well written saga, but this was just...wow.  If I hadn't bought the book while on vacation I would have returned it.  It had it's moments, which is why I give it a two.  There were some cute parts with Bella and Edward, but once it got past book one, it all went downhill.  Reading about Jacob's angst in book two was probably the most boring thing I've ever had to sit through.  And of course, book three was pretty much an atrocity.  Bella's oh so tragic martyr character was the cause of many' o'eye-rolls.  I wish I hadn't read this book, I would rather pretend it was left as a trilogy, honestly.  I felt that it really ruined the series.</review>

<review id="8990">This movie was a huge disappointment. Everything about it was all wrong...the cast, the scenes, the story. I saw the movie after reading the first two books and I was absolutely shocked and dumbfounded with the HORRIBLE acting and the less-than-stellar casting job. Kristen Stewart ruined Bella's character and there was absolutely nothing about Robert Patterson to fall in love with. Watching the movie was depessing after having loved the book so much. I was really afraid after watching it that these were the people that were going to be in my head when I read the last two books because I knew it would ruin it for me. Thankfully, I somehow blocked the faces of the untalented actors out and was able to still enjoy Eclipse and Breaking Dawn. If I were Stephenie Meyer, I would be heartbroken over the slaughtering of her book into a movie. I would never spend the money on this movie and I will not go to see the next one that comes out. I'll stick to books with this series....</review>

<review id="8991">Don't get me wrong it's nifty but it's far from perfect. Oops it only has usb 1.0 extra jacks. There's no reference for what the gaming keys have been assigned to do(little screens on each key like on another keyboard would have been nice). There's that switch to turn off the windows key, but why does a keyboard for gamers have a windows key in the first place. The result is that the Ctrl key is farther out than I'm use to (I've used an old IBM clicky keyboard for years).The included apps are barely useful, there are better mods out there but stuff like a task manager should have been a no-brainer. The screen should have been in color and higher resolution.If you have a working keyboard you can stick with that and wait a generation or two before getting this sort of keyboard. This is a vanity purchase at best.</review>

<review id="8993">I so (sadly) agree with the previous two reviews. Yes!! Twilight, the original book of the series, was a wonder surprise. I'd have to use both hands and feet to count how much older I am than SM's average reader, however Twilight woke-up the teenager I once was... but even then, I would have hated the love-triangle story line. It is trite and rarely executed well as one reviewer stated. What bothers me most is the fact that SM had a somewhat beautiful, sophomoric love story going, but ruined it when the leading male character turned from a sophisticated, mysteriously interesting decisive man to a Woody Allen marshmallow. And Jacob, jeez how did he phase from a happy go-lucky sensitive friend into an angry, controlling sexual aggressor?  And Bella is okay with this? Half way through the book I was hoping Victoria would snack on that [...] of a dad, Charlie who is so darn complicit and clueless that I could barely continue to read any further. Perhaps if I made him spaghetti with fire-roasted tomato sauce would he grow a pair? Can someone please tell me why SM decided to turn Edward into a salad, when in the first book he was a decadent, lip smacking good treat!! I'm heading to the bookstore tonight to get the final installment, as I like to finish what I start.</review>

<review id="8995">I bought this mixer about 3 years ago.  I would say I use it on a bi weekly basis (sometimes less).  I have purchased almost all of the attachments (grinder, juicer, food strainer, shredder, etc.).  I was making buttercream icing (it is thick, but not even close to dough), and all of a sudden something clicked, and now my $400 dollar mixer has stripped gears.  I would expect that a mixer that says it can handle double batches of bread dough, should be able to handle 1 batch of icing!!  It is going to cost about $150 to fix.  I also have a 5 quart that I got for my mom.  It had been used about 10 times (she is not much of a baker).  It will only go slow even on high.  That is going to be another $65.  I have several other kitchen items from Kitchenaid that just are not very good quality (knives that rust, and a $75 roster that peels after 2 uses).  I will be fixing both of these mixers, and selling them and all of my attachments and get a Viking (maybe there is a reason Alton has one now).  My aunt has my dad's older model, and it is still going strong, I just do not think they make them like they used to (they are made so cheaply now).  I will NEVER buy Kitchenaid again.</review>

<review id="8998">Like many people here I've used TT for a number of years.  I was getting ready to download the latest version and started looking at the reviews.  No way I'm paying that much more just to get the same functionality as previous years.  Looking for an alternative solution now. Thanks everyone,</review>

<review id="8999">I bought two of these drives at the same time. The one is still going strong, but the other crashed, never to be revived, about six months from purchase. I returned it under warranty and SanDisk sent a replacement. It's not my drive fixed and, of course any information I had on the drive is gone. Okay, I could deal with that, but now that drive has also crashed and burned. There's no reviving, formatting or recovering my information....again. This time I trashed the drive; I'd kept good back-ups of all the information, I'm only out my original purchase price and postage to return it the first time. This is my last SanDisk purchase...fool me once, but not twice.</review>

<review id="9000">The menus in these programs are completely unusable.  Microsoft won't admit they blew it, but instead want us all to believe the menus are "more intuitive".  BS.  I've been researching the issue, and evidently a company has software that makes the menus in Office 2007 look like Office 2003.  ThinK i may get it.  [...]</review>

<review id="9001">I also have to second those who wonder what the frak all the fuss is about.  BSG *was* a very good show. . . until they did the whole New Caprica bit.  Since then, it's gone steadily downhill. Silly storylines, storylines going nowhere, logical disconnects and nifty things just put aside (the Six in Baltar's head, for example . . . she was great and where is she now?  Episodically present, at best.).  Hello, we're supposed to shocked-SHOCKED that Helo led a mutiny?  Starbuck was acting looney-toons.  You'd have to be brain-dead NOT to mutiny.  Silly stuff like that makes me grit my teeth.This series has been meandering and staggering toward some kind of conclusion for two years.  About time it ended.  Slouching toward Bethlehem indeed . . .</review>

<review id="9002">I've had this unit for over a year and while I like it better than a plain bowl of water, there are some flaws. The blue reservoir is growing algae in the corners and because of its shape, it's impossible to clean those spots. I also have hard water in my apartment, so the slide gets a lot of hardwater build up which doesn't come off with scrubbing. Finally, the thing is always getting clogged up with cat hair and weekly cleanings are necessary if you don't want your cat drinking gross hairy water.I will likely purchase the type of fountain that comes down like a faucet whenever this one breaks but I won't buy this one again.</review>

<review id="9003">I had an iRiver 795 that I download many books from the library site.  I loved it and listened to many many novels.   Unfortunately while visiting a friend at Cleveland Clinic it disappeared from my coat pocket (my own fault for being so trusting!)  I could not find another one like it, so decided, on the advice of a friend, to buy this SanDisk.   What a piece of junk.   I literally wanted to throw it out of my car window last week.   When you turn it off, it automatically goes back all the way back to the beginning of the section.  So if you are 45 minutes into that section...you are back to square one.   If you try to fast forward to where you were, it goes to the next chapter.   I have tried everything...including writing to the "help" (less) people at SanDisk.  They told me to download the firmware update....which I had already done. That must be their pat reply when someone has a problem.   I hate this mp3 player and plan to give it to my grandchildren to play with and find something to listen to my books.   This was a complete waste of money!!</review>

<review id="9004">Difficult to assemble, with poor instructions.  No labels on parts diagrams, but it is expected that one knows the names of them.  Many parts not shown in diagram.When I finally got it together, it leaked all over the place.  I  put it back in the box and returned it requesting a replacement. A couple of weeks later, still nothing.At the time I ordered this fountain, I also ordered extra filters to make the order large enough to qualify for free shipping.  I sent the extra filters back at the same time I sent the leaky fountain back, and I immediately received a new package of filters along with an email saying "your order is complete".  The filters are, obviously, useless without a working fountain.  Now what about paying for shipping to replace them?A very unsatisfactory experience (so far).</review>

<review id="9005">Very disappointed.  I have other Netgear components on the network that have worked flawlessly for years, but this particular model does indeed have the issue many people have reported about disconnects.  I could see how an average email checking / web surfing user would not care much about it, but I use software for work that requires a full restart when disconnected, so this switch drives me absolutely crazy.Every few hours everything attached to it just disconnects, as if they are plugged into nothing.  Sometimes it comes back up in about 2 minutes, about 25% of the time I need to unplug the unit and plug it back in to get it to reconnect to the computers again.  I am back on Amazon to find a different switch and figured I'd warn everyone that this one is headed for the trash bin here.  I still believe Netgear makes a great product, just this particular unit is flawed. Funny sidenote, actually disconnected me two times while writing this, don't think it wanted me to warn everyone about it. :-)</review>

<review id="9006">Let me preface this by saying I'm not a TWEEN.  So, perhaps my opinion may not matter to most of you, as I'm reading this series from an adult's perspective (30 something).  However, I will share my thoughts, as I always do here on Amazon.While I felt Twilight was decent, New Moon was much improved, Eclipse was disappointing for me.  While again I think the writing has improved VERY much since the 1st book in the series, I just felt this one sort of lacked....something.  I guess after spending all of this time reading the first two books, I was hoping this book might finally move at a faster pace and bring us where we all suspect this is going, Bella becoming a vampire.  However, nearing the climax, I felt again, let down.  I mean, come on, I think this makes something like 1500 pages read...and I feel like I was still waiting for I thought what would happen in book one.I guess now it's on to Breaking Dawn, to see where that will leave us, and I hope give us readers a pay off!</review>

<review id="9007">I bought this with lots of hope. It claims to do lots of things. But fails doing most. Software is very buggy. Call forwarding from Skype to PSTN does not work. Also the other way around never works.  Only thing works on this is it can be used as a USB Skype adaptor for a regular phone. You do not need this to do that. Contacted customer support, they did not even responded. It's just a brick for me right now.</review>

<review id="9009">This is my third unit I have purchased.  I like the way it looks and what it does when it WORKS!!!  It is definitely not for more than one pet.  When I had one pet it worked for about a year.  Now that I have three it lasted 4 months. Wish they would fix the problems.  My pump no longer works.  It makes horrible noises even when full.  Just not a great addition to someone trying to save time and give their pets good water.</review>

<review id="9010">I am glad I purchased this product from Amazon instead from one of those free companies where they want all your personal info.  I purchased it based on published information that it was a tool to assist with weight loss.  I have used my month's supply and it was not as stated.It was shipped very fast.  Maybe it will work for someone else.  I did not have any side effects as I took it with food as the directions indicated.</review>

<review id="9011">The Pedometer is fairly accruate. The belt clip is way too small to fit a man's belt. They give you a small additional cable and clip to hold the pedometer when it falls off your belt.I lost my Pedometer at the car dealer and had it returned. Lost it again two days later and it's gone for good.I would not buy another one just to have it for a week or two.</review>

<review id="9012">Totally worthless product. Don't know why good reviews unless using for very little dogs. I used for large dogs & didn't affect them at all. Oh and I purchased four of them and mounted them in different, varied locations. Better product to get is a spray collar - works wonderful.</review>

<review id="9013">this product works just like the older Nano's except it has one major flaw.  IT WILL NOT WORK WITH YOUR ACCESSORIES.  IT WILL NOT WORK WITH THE DENON IPOD DOCK, IT WILL NOT WORK IN YOUR BMW AND LEXUS that have Ipod connections.  IT WILL NOT WORK WITH YOUR BOSE SOUND DOCK and nearly all other accessories.  It will play, but it wont charge and wont turn off, so it runs the battery out and just sits dead.the really infuriating thing is that Apple has pushed this device into the market as a portable music storage device and if you are like me, you have invested hundreds or thousands of dollars on docks for your home entertainment centers and autos.  They are really treating their customers very poorly with this move.</review>

<review id="9014">The switch worked for less than 12 hours. It worked great right out of the box. Then in the morning it tried to get online and nothing. All that happens now is the power light blinks. I spent 45 minutes talking to someone who made it apparent that they knew very little about the product and was going off a checklist. Very frustrating I will not buy another and hope I never have to talk to their tech support again. I would have given it a zero if I was allowed to.</review>

<review id="9015">I got the SimpleTech 1TB "designed by Pininfarina" USB drive from a local store in Vancouver, Canada about two months ago. It worked fine to back up my Mac using Time Machine.  I was pretty happy with it.  So, I purchased three more SimpleTech "designed by Pininfarina" 1TB USB drives days ago. However, one drive didn't spin. (No vibration even though the power indicator was on.) Another drive didn't mount. I tried both drives on two Macs. No luck. I didn't want to risk opening the last drive. The person at the store's return & exchange department checked one drive, and he couldn't connect it to the store's PC. So, I got my money back.I am not going to assume what went wrong. Just be sure you buy it from a place that has a great return policy.</review>

<review id="9016">I purchased this 8GB drive and now a month later am getting a dialog that the disk is write protected when trying to save or delete files. I never turned any write protection on and this model has no write protection switch on it. This is a huge issue with Kingston as you can find posts all over the net by Googling as well as a KB article on their website, KDT-092405-1. No resolution from Kingston, not even software to access the processer on the drive to disable write protection. their only resolution is that the drive is defective, thats it.</review>

<review id="9017">The only thing this KB has going for it is, it lights up.Even that is not great, the lighting is uneven and not nearly as bright as I would like it.This KB made for the gaming community, where Mountain Dew, Fat Tire Ale, Captain Morgan Private Stock Rum, Cheeto's, Pizza, and any other ungodly type of vice you can imagine are only inches away....DO NOT SPILL ANYTHING on this p.o.s. it is NOT made for a gamers environment, and if your careful and manage not to spill on it, FORGET ABOUT L.A.N. Parties, you can not guarantee safety in that social environment.My opinion, its an overpriced beer magnet, that can not withstand the environmental conditions for which it was marketed.Get something else.</review>

<review id="9019">This review is from: Watchmen (Hardcover)      Okay, I realize that w/out Alan Moore, the road for a genius such as Neil Gaiman would have been more difficult.  No doubt Moore helped pave the way for those who would take comic books to greater heights, exploring the medium's potential to its fullest.I'm not sure TIME MAGAZINE put THE best "graphic novel" on its list of Top 100 Novels of the 20th Century.  Without a doubt, the collected volumes of Neil Gaiman's SANDMAN would be more worthy of inclusion...same for Art Spiegelman's MAUS.  I've read all three (WATCHMEN, entire SANDMAN series & MAUS) an equal number of times.  With SANDMAN and MAUS, I always discover something newly unknown and magical with each repeated reading.  With WATCHMEN I tend to see more of its warts & flaws with each reading.Gaiman and Spiegelman have an ear for poetic prose and dialogue.  By comparison, though dense and laden with many words, Moore's style of writing is often so verbose, as though a lack of brevity will equal a profound statement.  It doesn't.  Often less is more...and this is a lesson that Moore, even after all these years, has yet to master.Finally, when dealing with writers such as Neil Gaiman or Art Spiegleman (and there are dozens of others whom I could mention, but felt it simpler to limit comparisons to these two accomplished writers in comics), one feels that they often bring out the nightmarish and horrific in order to shine a light on what is, essentially, the better angels within humanity.And both writers DO enter into dark & disturbing terrain.By contrast, one gets the feeling that Moore sometimes pontificates on the importance of humanity as a cheap vehicle to go full guns into his disturbing mind and world.  Acts of grace...when they occur in Moore's work...seem to exist only to remind his readers that the world is not entirely one of no god, no hope, no future.  However, if given his way, I get the feeling that Moore would happily skip the better angels of humanity and would dwell entirely in the abyss.  After having lived with WATCHMEN for over twenty years, it is a flawed, bloated and pompous work...more an exercise in histrionics rather than a work that sheds anything new on humans (be they costumed, with super-powers, or otherwise).  It does not hold up nearly as well as the works of Gaiman or Spiegleman.  TIME magazine picked the wrong token graphic novel to include in its 100 Best Novels of the 20th Century.When I read MAUS, I wish that I had Spiegleman's knack for pathos and natural dialogue.  When I read Neil Gaiman's SANDMAN (or just about any of Gaiman's work), I wish that I had Gaiman's extensive knowledge of myth, archtypes, religions, symbols and literature (as well as his eloquence in both narrative and dialogue).  When I read Alan Moore (whether it's WATCHMEN or V FOR VENDETTA or LOST GIRLS)...I pretty much find myself forever grateful that I'm not Alan Moore.  I don't mind that Moore tackles disturbing topics.  More than anything, I resent when Moore...with all the people skills of a misanthrope...exploits tender human situations (which, in Moore's hands, feel completely void of any sincerity/empathy) for the sole purpose of making his bleak, nihilsitic vision all the more potent.We get it, Alan...the world is a place where there be dragons.  It's why you seldom leaves you small town in England (and will do your research through books rather than ever visit the settings with which he writes with the false authority of a self-appointed expert).  Fine, Alan.  Just leave the goodness and grace of humans out of your tomes.  Humanity and grace serve a higher purpose than the way you exploit them...as a vessel to merely offer a dichotomy/diversion to the demons that drive you.  What's written above would also apply to Frank Miller...Gaiman/Spiegleman and Moore/Miller...one may as well say "the sacred and the profane."</review>

<review id="9020">Product arrived on time for Christmas, however it would not hold a charge and I have sent it back for a refund.  The refund process is very time consuming and it has been one week and I still have not received confirmation that they have received the item for refund.  Very disappointing.</review>

<review id="9021">I bought this fountain just under a year ago to replace the PetMate that I bought in 2001.  I am constantly cleaning the fountain because the filter cartridges leave charcoal all over the slide.  If it is not completely full, it is so noisy that my cat won't go anywhere near it.  The flow control broke on the first one, which I returned to the store, and then broke again on the second one the last time I took it apart to clean.  The PetMate had none of these issues, and I was able to stick it in the dishwasher on the top rack.  In terms of design, the Drinkwell is very hard to fill unless you buy the add on reservoir.  I only have one cat, and so did not purchase the reservoir...  leaving the only way to really fill the fountain is by dumping the water in the front.  Also, since the motor sits on the outside, it is very prone to collecting condensation and developing slime or mold issues.I just reordered a PetMate fountain to replace this one...  its a better product.</review>

<review id="9022">I actually fell in love with my SanDisk based on its near-perfect sound, small size and ease of use, until 4 months after I got it and experienced what so many others here have experienced---The frozen SanDisk screen.  Now my computer won't even recognize it when it's plugged in, so I'll have to recompile all of my music onto a new device.  SanDisk's advice for a fix or a reformat didn't work.  Obviously, an inherent manufacturing flaw.</review>

<review id="9023">Product is great but AMazon not fair about prices.   3 refill pack, $49.99 & savings of $10? and that includes free shipping!But when I chose the 6 refill pack for $89.99, I noticed over $30 shipping and doesn't qualify for free shipping.  In other words, on the 3 pack, you're being charged for shipping in the hidden retail price. Not a happy customer! Bummer,  Caveat emptor, buyer beware.</review>

<review id="9025">impatiently waiting 30 + minutes to get the dark fluid out is so annoying that i'll be sending mine back.  the process to get a second cup is messy, then the coffee is nothing special, and the steam wand ejects more water than air.  how can so many reviewers be so off the mark?</review>

<review id="9026">I wish I could give this thing zero stars. I bought it yesterday (not from Amazon) and have had nothing but problems. The documentation is the worst I've ever seen and assumes that you're a wireless expert. The connection drops every 20 minutes or so and from what I've read online, this is a known problem. I spent an hour with tech support and was assured that the problem was fixed. It wasn't. The speed is great, I will give it that. I've tried one more fix and if that doesn't work, I'll be returning it tomorrow for a different brand. Do yourself a favor and stay away.</review>

<review id="9027">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      Does Stephenie Meyer get paid by the word?  This book is BORING!!!  I guess the story line has merit; it just takes forever to get there.  The first three quarters of the book could be eliminated.  The only character that has any substance is Jacob; Bella needs to get over herself.  If you want to fall asleep you could use this book.</review>

<review id="9028">I bought this for my 10 year old and it worked for about 3-4 days.  Then at startup it froze after the welcome screen.  Reset did nothing.  Returned it to Amazon and received a 2nd one in less than a week, which was commendable service from Amazon.  Same thing happended to the second player.  Returned it and bought an Ipod.  No issues so far after two months.  I would not recommend the M250 MP3 player.</review>

<review id="9029">I was highly disappointed with this book! The Twilight series is one of my favorite series. I loved the characters, and the way things were executed. But Breaking Dawn was aweful..Stephanie crammed everything into one book. Instead of making Bella grow and evolve she kept her weak, naive, and plain out annoying! Edward's character was ok, and i really liked how Jacob came of age. Rosalie made me wish someone would smack her a few times for being so psycho regardless of how badly she wanted a child. I just hated this. It had so much potential and lacked so much.</review>

<review id="9030">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      If you put aside the spectacular special effects, terrific car-chase scenes and Heath Ledger's extraordinary performance, all you're left with is a very predictable story.  I saw more strategy displayed in a checkers game at Washington Square Park in New York than I did in this movie.  No wonder this movie was rated PG-13: it was meant for the intellect of a grade school student (with no offense to them).  However, the violence is not meant for a 13-year old.  (And then we wonder why there are so many student shootings at high schools and colleges.)  It's kinda ironic that "Brokeback Mountain" was rated R and this movie was rated PG-13.  Instead of wasting your money on this movie, check out "Entre Les Murs," which won the Best Picture at the Cannes Film Festival this year.  That film will give you very good insight on what grade school students are like in any country.  Maybe you'll understand why movies like "The Dark Knight" causes students to behave as they do in movies like "Entre Les Murs."</review>

<review id="9032">I purchased the Netgear WGR614 mainly because of its ability to limit access to the wireless network via a MAC address along with using Wep encryption. I wanted more security. My old SMC Barricade Router only used Wep encryption, but had a solid wireless connection. The Netgear router installs very easily as do most routers now days and the hard wire ports work fine, but the wireless connection would drop every 10 to 15 seconds at only 20 ft away. I tried downloading the latest firmware, but to no avail. Needless to say, the connectivity issue was unacceptable and I gave it away.</review>

<review id="9033">I really suggest that you don't buy this.  It says that if it freezes you just put something small into the reset switch but i tried and it is still froze. And you can't take of the back lid so you cant take of the battery!!!It is annoying to put music on and videos they have to be a certain file type. don't buy this</review>

<review id="9034">I would not recommend this collor for dogs with long hair.  I used it on a 9 month old Malamute with no undercoat yet but the prongs still had a problem making contact with the skin (which is necessary to work effectively).  To remedy this I tried to tighten the collor to create closer contact but this resulted in my dog constantly hacking and throwing up on the carpet.  I next shaved my dogs neck and loosened the collar, but the shock this created for this size of dog was only slightly irratating and the barking continued.  I believe this collar would be an effective tool on small shorter hair breeds, but I would avoid attemping to expect positive results on larger breeds.  I'd rate it a 2 out of 5.</review>

<review id="9035">This Camcorder is Compact, lightweight build; stores video to 30GB hard drive or Memory Stick Pro Duo cards touch screen. The standard-definition video quality is disappointing to say the least. theirs no optical image stabilization. However it's a good design and reasonable feature set for its price, but the video quality doesn't measure up to the rest of the package. I'm a loyal Sony customer and I expected more out of this camcorder, and I have to say that I'm disappointed in this item.</review>

<review id="9036">Let me just say that this book had potential and it seems like the author chose to throw that right out the window when she wrote this.  I believe that Meyer spent so much time trying to make all of her readers happy, that she ended up failing miserably.  Of course, if you're a fan of Twilight, you have to read it, regardless of reviews.  I just want it known how utterly disappointed I was.  First of all, the ending was ridiculous.  I could force myself to look past the incubus/succubus thing in the middle of the book, and I could even look past Edward biting into Bella's stomach.  But, the ending battle, I could not look past.  Why would all these vampires gather to have a battle and then nothing happen?  Meyer was able to use this to make the story more interesting, but instead she made it the perfect non-violent ending, which was just annoying.I didn't mind some of the things that other reviews on here complain about, like Bella being the perfect vampire and whatnot and even the ridiculous "love shield", since if she were normal, there would be no reason to write the story to begin with.  I didn't even mind her begging Edward for sex.  What frustrates me the most is that Meyer had so much potential to make this book riveting and she chose to ignore it.  Instead it was almost 800 pages of mushy garbage.  I felt the need to finish it, but at the same time I couldn't wait until it was over.</review>

<review id="9037">Initially I thought this was a great drive. It held a lot of data and I was never quite able to fill it up. After all, it's got almost 16 Gb of data capacity - much more than I really needed on a portable drive. The speed of the drive was acceptable. I never had any complaints. My only issue with this drive is that one day when I really needed some data off of it I plugged it in and it didn't work. It had been working just a few hours before, but when I really needed it I got a message that I needed to format the drive. Suddenly Windows XP didn't recognize it and I had no access to my data. I later tried the drive on several other computers with different operating systems and got the same results. I suppose it's possible that the drive was demagnitized, but I don't know how it would have happened since the drive was just in my pocket the whole time. In any case, the drive went from a great asset to a non-asset nearly instantly. Instead of reformatting I was forced to order a replacement flash drive from another manufacturer due to lack of trust with this one.Incidentally, the caps slide off of these drives really easily. They are just held on by friction (rubber against metal). If you put the drive in your pocket or attach it to your keychain the cap will eventually slide off in your pocket or wherever you happen to be. It's almost a guaranteed eventual loss for whoever owns them.After initially losing mine I went to the manufacturer's website and found a button and an associated form to request replacement caps. I filled out the form about 4 or 5 weeks ago and still haven't received any replacement caps. Two weeks ago I ordered another drive with a similar friction cap design and in anticipation of losing the cap I emailed their customer service department requesting a couple of extras. I already received 2 replacement caps from them free of charge. I think that shows a big difference in the support offered by this manufacturer and other flash drive manufacturers. As far as the ruggedness of this drive's design goes, I'd say it appears to be reasonably rugged. It is encased in a seemingly thick outer rubber layer. I never had any problems with physical damage to the drive.</review>

<review id="9038">If you're a day trader (and a Mac user), you might be better off filling out your tax return by hand.  Something changed this year in TurboTax that doesn't allow you to quickly input your stock transactions.  And TurboTax seems to run alot slower on the Mac.Unlike last year's where you could skip the "Easy Step" and go straight to the forms to directly input your transactions, now you are forced to either use the excruciatingly slow "Easy Step" or use the so-called Capital Gains "Speed Entry" Worksheet.  And if you've had hundreds of transactions, "Easy Step" would require you to spend a few days to input all of them.  And if you decide to use the Speed Entry Worksheet, you'd have to input each transaction in its entirety, not just the cost basis that your financial institution forgets to send you. Note that this CD comes with both the Mac and PC version.  I tried them both and it seems the PC version is a little faster when it comes to editing stock transactions.Since the deadline's just a few days away, I'll just suck it up and use TurboTax's "Easy Step" to edit all of my transactions.  Too bad I can't just used TurboTax 2006 for 2007's tax return.</review>

<review id="9039">I have had my Western Digital External Hard Drive for about a year now. It has worked fine, mounted properly onto my desktop and been easily accessible for backing up files and retrieving files. I came onto this site to find another backup for it since I started getting nervous about losing all my files and data. I have a wonderful Macbook Pro and I couldn't be more pleased with it. I started to read some of the reviews for this company's products and I was surprised at how many of their drives fail, and then how many customers were irate because customer service gives them the run around and data retrieval services are insanely priced. I decided to go with another backup. Well, I was too late. My backup arrived a day before Christmas, and on Christmas, my Western Digital Hard Drive failed. It won't appear on my desktop and I can't retrieve my files anymore.  The thing I want to know is, why release a product that is as transient as an 8 hour battery?   What is the point?  I think back on how many important files I lost (my fault for gambling on a company of course) and I wonder, how can these people stay in business if they are releasing less than reliable technology that ends up screwing the consumer?  Capitalism can be a cancer I guess. I would just like to warn the consumer, please do your homework, maybe look into another way to keep your files stored because Western Digital might help you out for about a year, maybe 6 months, hell, I've read even 2 weeks, but they will ultimately fail you miserably. I am very sad about this and wish there were a way to get some of my important files back, I guess next time I will be more careful.</review>

<review id="9041">I used this product for over a year, so am well familiar with its ins and outs.  On the good end, it shaves well and cleanly without the attachments.  The precision blade works well for general shaping and the foil is effective for cleaning up.  On the bad end, the attachments don't work well.  Hair collects in them easily and prevents further effective shaving.  The hair is hard to remove without taking off the attachment.  Also, note how the blades are positioned on both sides of the foil; it makes it very hard to use the foil on sensitive regions without nicking oneself with the blades.  Finally, I tried using this once and only once in the shower.  The razor stopped working the next day.  RIP.For shaving one's own back hair, it's too hard to reach with this; try the Mangroomer (as silly as the name may be, it's a good product)!  For other shaving, I've replaced this with a Wahl 9953 and hope for better results.</review>

<review id="9045">This router worked great for one month!  I kept it on a solid cool surface.  Then one day it just stopped working.  Delivering only half the speed. I called for customer support, followed all the directions to reset, repower computer, modem, etc and it still didn't work.Then I spent 45 minutes on hold, only to be HUNG UP ON by the representative from India!  I was being polite and asking for help, she asked me to reset my computer and I told her it might take a minute, and she hung up on me!  Trying to save time on her records, I guess.DO NOT BUY THIS MODEM!  OR ANY LINKSYS MODEM!  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT!!!  BUYER BEWARE!  I'm so angry I'm going to submit a BBB review next.PS let me know if there's a better router out there, besides linksys, because I'm not buying another linksys product until they step their game up.</review>

<review id="9046">This router worked perfectly 5 months, then started freezing a couple times a day, requiring me to cycle the power.I am now on hold to Linksys, my fourth phone call to them, getting a total run-around.  First 2 times I called tech support.  They asked the same questions each time, had me change a few things in the configuration, then told me to call back if the problem continues.   Today I insisted on getting a warranty replacement, so I was referred to customer service -- who told me I need to talk to tech support first to get approval for a replacement!!  I think I have spent more in time that this router is worth, and next time I'll try some other brand, anything other than Linksys.</review>

<review id="9047">I received this for christmas and I used it for the first time tonight for grilled chicken.  What a pain.  The cooking was not even, the fat didn't drain it just sat in the grill channels and burned.  Which gets me to my next point, it's not as non-stick as it should be.  After a few minutes I made my husband clean it for me since he gave it to me.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because I may like it for sandwiches but that remains to be seen.  I would never have spent 130 dollars on this grill.  Save the money and buy a grill pan and a griddle. If you want to press sandwiches get a brick!</review>

<review id="9050">30 pound dog Advantix applied according to directions.  She became tachycardic, and experenced lethargy, vomiting, rapid breathing, frantic scratching and biting her legs.

<review id="9051">I have a Tibetan Terrier who ONLY barks when left alone for long periods of time. So it was very difficult to test this product, since he won't bark when we try to make him. Still, we'd put it on and leave and the neighbors would complain when we got back. I finally called the company and the customer service rep asked if the dog has a high pitched bark. The dog has a VERY high pitched bark. Turns out, their older models (which they no longer sell) work fine with a high pitched bark, but the new model (the one with the on/off switch) doesn't work at all with a high pitched bark. They offered to change out our model for the older version, which I guess they keep in their warehouse for this very purpose. But, if your dog has high pitched bark, you're better off calling Premier directly and figuring out how to get the older model. Or find a brand that works.</review>

<review id="9052">Just wanted to share thoughts on my recent experience with the DLink Xtreme-N Gigabit wireless router.This is the sixth router I have had to deal with at home the past few years, so I have had experience primarily with Netgear and Linksys wireless router products. Netgear was ok as far as user friendliness for set-up and performance; however, they seem to "burn-out" after 1.5 to 2 years. Linksys was more complex to set-up and seem to be prone to dropping connections; therefore, everyday performance was consistently unreliable. Reason I bought the DLink DIR-655 was because...1. Different vendor, different product features, 2. pre-N claims of more powerful and further distance,3. my research gave me the feeling that DLink had somewhat better performance, support, reliability, and....4. their marketing claims were matched by somewhat positive feedback and reviews by consumers.My experiences...1. Typical wireless set-up where I got confused by myriad of optional settings and configurations. Documentation was ok...but not easy for a home user to understand. Give it a "B-" for this initial step.2. I got the installation to a point and needed to call DLink support. I must say the support person that helped was perfect. He spoke good english, had a good sense of humor, and guide me through the remaining installation/configuration process. Note: There was no way I could of gotten my DLink network up without the support person. Give it a "A" for this next step on my path to establish wifi in the house again. 3. DLink supplied "free trial" Network Magic software......forget it. It crashed both my sony Vaio laptops. They get a "F" for failure.4. Maintenance. Because of the initial set-up issues, I am afraid to perform any maintenance as a firmware upgrade, enable other features, etc. DLink support told me not to upgrade firmware unless I have real problems. Huh? They just released version 1.10 firmware on 10/25/07 and my router is on 1.02. There is most likely benefits to upgrading; however, I am uncomfortable with tackling this at this time. Also don't want to agitate my wife! DLink gets a "C" for maintenance options.5. Performance. I had a clunky Linysys router that I got free when I tried Vonage internet phone service. Quite honestly, it had drop outs, but at least the performance was consistent to all areas of our home. The DLink DIR-655 is all over the map performance wise. Some days I get two bars of strengh, sometimes four, but never five bars of performance. I even use the DLink Xtreme-N PCMCIA card adapter and still less than steller performance. Dlink gets a "C" for speed, distance, and overall performance. All in all, I think I want to try a Belkin router next. Hope this helps everyone. DLink DIR-655 is a so-so.</review>

I've emailed them twice.Original review:The MinoHD I received didn't work. It hung every time I tried to record and had to be force-reset even to power down. Customer Service told me that must be happening because I hadn't charged it properly or because I was pushing the buttons the wrong way. I explained that I had charged it fully and that it hung without pushing any buttons at all except Record -- and what's with a device that hangs unless you have perfect button-pushing technique anyway?After a series of emails they finally agreed to repair it, though not to replace it. Then they said I had to pay the shipping -- "it's our policy." In the end they did agree to pay the shipping. Weeks later, I still have no MinoHD and no further communication from them. I'll have to resume complaining. Beware!Flip Video MinoHD Camcorder, 60 Minutes (Black)</review>

<review id="9061">After contacting LINKSYS for literally 10 hours on a Saturday and Sunday, along with other phone calls to supplement, they still cannot make it a secure network or explain why not.  Every time something does not work, they blame the router.  One tech support tried to convince me that BestBuy sold me a used LINKSYS router!  The bottom line with LINKSYS equipment, it is a good value IF and IF it works.  My problem is the new router is always resetting, not keeping a solid connection, etc.  It is very frustrating.  While I do not what router I am going to get to replace this one, I will not use LINKSYS is at all possible.  UPDATE, while trying to load this review, the router blew off again.  Nice!</review>

<review id="9062">I loved the first three books. And I realize that I'm in the huge minority here... but I was always on team Jacob. Edward has always been too emo for my tastes. New Moon was a great book for me because Edward went away for awhile. And if I were Bella, I would never have accepted Edward back into my life so quickly like that. I'm afraid of the message that these books are sending to young girls. Stand by your emo man. Case in point, on Island Esme. If it were my honeymoon and my husband would have treated me like that, refusing sex, angry with me for wanting sex, being all weird and passive aggressive... I would have demanded an annulment. But no, Bella is all apologies. It's really gross. It's like she has no mind of her own... nothing to define who she is except her great love with Edward. Marriage and babies at 18? No no no no... wrong message for young girls. Dangerous. No one really knows who they are at 18... Edward is 17 but happens to be over 90, lucky him. I realize that this is a fantasy but it really kind of takes us girls back a hundred years to when Edward really was 17. Where there is no such thing as feminism.  That being said, I couldn't put the book down. It was still a great story even though I didn't agree with all of it. Meyer is a great storyteller. I just think that deep down, we don't want the same things. I certainly didn't want to be married with a kid at age 18 (and even now in my late twenties)... and I don't really think that any girl should be married at 18. It's the year 2008! Hell, even if a girl were as allegedly mature as Bella (which I really don't think she was, sorry Renee), even if my true love was a vampire (because I would have burned myself at the stake rather than listen to Edward's whining emo crap for all of eternity.)No, I would have gone to college... and married Jake at the ripe old age of 25. But that's just me.</review>

<review id="9063">I bought Office 2008 home and student edition. It was SO weak (read my review) that I reinstalled Office 2004. After being told the Office 2008 "special media edition" would handle all my problems, I forked over substantially more money. The first application I turned on was Entourage. Since 2004 Entourage has been the only email program that doesn't support hyperlinks. You were forced to import external scripts or cut and paste from a word processing program. Well, Entourage 2008 STILL doesn't have a hyperlink function. It is soooo 90's (plus very unprofessional) to have to include an entire URL into you email document. It is a slap in the face to call this an upgrade. Also a slap in the wallet.</review>

<review id="9064">I am not going to bash Meyer...how could I when I got so much enjoyment out of reading the Twilight Series???? But, I was expecting Breaking Dawn to capture the consequences of the choices Bella made.  Every possible issue ended up perfectly for Bella.  No great battle, no newborn phase, no remorse for the child that could never be, no regret for missing a parent, no college.  Oh, and if you told your parents that you were in the CDC for having a rare illness and then later told them they would rather not really know everything going on...would your parents buy it?  Not mine.... Meyer was too worried about tieing up the loose ends that she failed to give us the conflicts, the conversation, the book we waited for.....She basically wrote a modern day version of Cinderella, sci fi style, where everything ends so perfectly...even the Romanians were disappointed....they didn't get their battle, either. So if you are expecting something like Twilight, take a deep breath...you will be disappointed.</review>

<review id="9066">This review is from: Quantum of Solace (Two-Disc Special Edition) (DVD)      This movie was as close to a waste of time as a Bond movie can get. The action sequences are so busy and disjointed you can't follow what's going on, who's doing what to whom. Forster has taken the jerky action cam thing to the ugly extreme. It's not even coherent enough to make you dizzy...you just sit there completely clueless as to what's going on.What's more, I'm just not down with the whole Bond as a "blunt instrument" thing these last two movies are promoting. That is not Bond. Bond is a suave, subtle, nuanced instrument who uses brains and ingenuity, and when all else fails, cool, gee-whiz gadgets...always the polished gentleman, and the ultimate ladies man (one look and they swoon). Daniel Craig is none of those things. I didn't like him as a choice when he was first announced, but decided to withhold judgment. But after two films I'm decided: he's not Bond. Bring on Clive Owen!Quantum of Solace [Theatrical Release]</review>

<review id="9068">Owned this model (Black Macbook) for 2 weeks. Could not get over how annoying and painful the palm rests were. It was crazy. I would immediately feel the edge of the palm rest digging into my wrists. And no, my method of typing was not the issue, it was the palm rest itself which are strangely sharp. I was also not so impressed with the screen itself. The only way I can describe it was that I felt it was not as sharp as the Dell Inspiron notebook I was using prior. The pros were of course it's a Mac and it's lightweight. I ended up purchasing a Macbook Pro months later and absolutely love it. If a Macbook Pro is too pricey for you, check out the new aluminum macbooks. Half a pound lighter and they seem to be much easier on the wrists.</review>

<review id="9069">I used to own a smaller 'Juicemaster juicer' . I liked it a lot and used it quite frequently. It had its drawbacks like it didn't collect all the pulp waste which ended up messing up the kitchen counter & walls a bit. But it was easy to use & clean and thus I used it a lot.The jack lallanes juicer : No matter how much I try to use it on a frequent basis, I end up not using it as much and it just sits there hogging up space.First the pros of the juicer : large size feeder lets you put in almost a whole apple or an orange. Large size juice container.cons: It is extremely difficult to clean. It has too many parts, the juice container, the lid, the feed-pusher, the pulp filter, the blade, the trash collector and it takes a whole 15 mins to clean all those just after getting two 8 oz glasses of juice. Its juice spout is designed so low that you cannot fit an 8 oz glas under it and I've ended up trying to tilt the glasses ultimately spilling the juice and making a mess. It doesn't extract as much juice as it could. I don't have a quantitave measure of it, but i have grabbed a bit of the pulp and squeezed it by hand and extracted more juice out of it. As a comparison, the pulp on my old juice master was very dry. The parts are not dish washer safe at all as seemingly claimed. If you read the fine print, only the SS blade and pulp filter are dishwasher safe. All other parts are of very poor quality and got stained after I put them in the dishwasher. 8 out of 10 juicing attempts on this juicer have been very frustrating for me (ignoring the cleaning part which is always frustrating).I would not recommend this juicer at all to anybody.</review>

<review id="9071">First let me state that I liked every other season of Smallville but this one. The reviews people have written remind me of people who know Star Wars Episodes I-III suck and refuse to say it because they're still attached to the good 'ol days of star wars. Well, the good 'ol days of smallville ended with season 6. Sure we knew that lana really didn't get killed off at the end of season six, but saying she used a clone in place of herself in order to fake her death is just lame. Lex giving up on lana? ha! He's a supervillain! They're insane! They don't give up! The rest is downhill, the season finale sucks. The writers don't leave you wanting more and from what i hear in Season 8 Michael Rosenbaum isn't going to be a regular. How can you continue this series without lex luthor. The only few bright spots in this season is 1: Lana is finally out of the picture..thank god, because she was really annoying 2: the way in which lionel dies 3: Veritas. Every season has had episodes that weren't up to par, but this was the worse. Hopefully, it will end with season 8. It would be hard for me to buy this season on DVD. If someone ever gives it to me it will probably collect dust on my shelf. The writers sure knew how to kill a great series. BRAVO!</review>

<review id="9073">I purchased the Sansa M250 2GB player as new. I loved it so much that I recommended it to a friend who was also in the process of looking for an easy to operate and not too expensive player. She, like me, also loved it.  I had less than 15 hours play time on mine when I got the -Frozen Sandisk screen.  However, I was lucky....my friends lasted less time than mine.  Her player did the the same frozen screen.   I called Amazon regarding a refund and since it was past the 30 day return/refund time frame...I was out of luck.  However, they gave me a toll free number to call the maker.  They were kind enough to do an even exchange for a new one.  They also paid the shipping.  I just had to find a box to put it in.  I'm in the process of waiting for them to send me the new one.....we'll see how it goes.  I was just so disappointed that I had taken the time to put over 450 songs on the thing and it just quits working in such a short amount of time.I do LOVE the player..if the next one work!!I'm adding this comment 05/2008...its been approximately 7 months since I wrote the above.  I quickly received my replacement and I love it.  I use it every single day.  Its great for the gym or walks.  I also love the radio feature...it picks up great.  I've more than gotten my moneys worth of use already.  Even tho I had problems with the first one.  The company made it so easy to exchange that I'd definitely buy another.

<review id="9075">This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)      This is a review of blu-ray edition, not of the contents.I was expecting the quality to be superior to all other BBC documentaries that I own. I was disappointed miserably, to the point that I feel compelled to write my first online review.Equipment: Sony PS3 feeding a 46 inch Sony Bravia 1080P, through premium HDMI cable.The good: Colors are stunning, and some shots, specially the ones from space, are absolutely breathtaking.The bad: Many grainy scenes. Quality varies. Some shots are as good as my DVD edition of Blue Planet. Some are better, and some are worse. A lot worse. In fact, in some scenes grain is so bad that if it were a movie, I would have thought it is done on purpose for the artistic effect. Somehow I had the impression that the master for this series was high def digitial, but it sure seems that quite a bit of it was film.The terrible: Here is something I had not seen before. Flicker. Huh?? On flyover scenes of waterfalls, screen starts flickering with a rising tempo. As we pass over the falls and look back at the falling water, flicker turns into a 'snow' screen that flashes at about 1 sec intervals. This is so bad that I am hoping I have a faulty component somewhere. :-(In summary: If you are thinking about buying the blu-ray edition for video quality, it might be better to rent it first to see if you have the issues that I did.----------------------Follow up: Based on suggestions of others, I played with connection, TV adjustements, noise reduction setting, and resolution settings. This is definitely a 1080P issue. At 720p, the problem is not present at all. At 1080i, the problem is present but almost unnoticeable. At 1080p problem is very obvious. The most annoying scene is disk 1, episode 3, as we fly over Angel Falls and look back. I can pause the picture and single frame advance to a frame that the 'snow' is very prominent. While picture is paused here, I can change resolutions, and see the noise only in 1080p. Since I do not have another blu-ray player, nor another TV, I cannot conclusively blame the disk. But I have had this problem only with this disk.</review>

<review id="9079">No doubt there are some great improvements on this model over the previous model. This includes a much better graphics card, a user replaceable hard drive, larger hard drive options, faster processor, and front side bus. However, there is one glaringly (literally) huge oversight on the design of this computer--that of the glossy-only option on the display. If you use this machine in front of windows, or near florescent lights, you will be faced with HUGE white bands of glare no matter how you position the machine. For a "pro" computer to not offer a non-glossy display (matte) option is UNACCEPTABLE. This is the kind of feature you would find on a consumer notebook, not a "pro" line.Sure, it's pretty, but at some point basic function must take priority over visual appeal.I've returned mine and I have ordered the previous generation macbook pro for my upgrade. Hopefully by the time it needs to be replaced Apple has come to their senses and introduces a real "pro" notebook.</review>

<review id="9083">I ordered this wireless router based on what other said about its quality. They were quite correct; it is well made.I ran into immediate problems, though, with the setup. Here's my situation:I have a Macintosh G4 and a BellSouth DSL connection. I'm adding a MacBook wireless connection using Mac OS internal Airport.The problem here is, probably, not with the technology. There is, however, a serious problem with the lack of installation documentation. I've Googled online and found dozens of people in my situation. Among Linksys, Bellsouth, Apple, there walls of insulation that make this setup far from simple.First, if linksys had provided a Macintosh setup CD it would have been a tremendous help. If I had been a wired geek, I probably could have called on my powers as a nerd to begin entering an endless string of IPs and DHCPs and PPoEs, etc. that need to be configured. I'm just a regular Joe user.Next, Bellsouth DSL, which I have used for years and like for its remarkable uptime abilities, provides no documentation whatsoever about making a wireless connection to its router. Not that I could find.Finally, Apple's Airport is friendly, but unprepared to bridge the gap between linksys and bellsouth.I expected plug and play, but got plop and play dead.

<review id="9086">Well, I go by alot of reviews on Amazon here, but I disagree with the ones here now, maybe I bougth the lemon, I've had this for a couple of years and have never had a good sharp edge on my knives, I am sure both wheels are the same grit and the the sharpening looks the same on both wheels, I've gone back to using my file to sharpen and in 20 to 30 seconds I can sharpen my knives with a razor edge where this machine only takes the flat spots off.</review>

<review id="9087">I have owned this camera for over a year now and will stop using it from now on. The poor video quality is just not worth the time and effort. At first I thought it would be good enough for YouTube but the bad quality video you shot to begin with then gets reduced further by YouTube making the end result simply terrible. The camera deals especially bad in darker, poor lit places, such as riding your bike in and out of tree shadows. The sound is completely unusable, just walking with it will sound like you're in the middle of a tornado. The only good thing I can say about this action cam is the amount of ways you can attach this camera to whatever it is you're into. It comes with a load of straps and mounts. BUT for an action cam I'm now looking elsewhere.</review>

<review id="9088">The gate does not swing back, does not close by itself and only the bottom lock works</review>

<review id="9089">In a nutshell, this camcorder is inconsistent when recording to DVD.  Fairly often, the screen will flash "disk error" and all of your prescious memories will be trapped on the disk, never to be seen by anyone.  In other words, the camcorder will write bad data to the disk, making it unreadable.  Unfortunately, once this happens, it cannot be corrected.  Also, the battery life is no more than 10 minutes.Save yourself some money and much dissapointment.  Do not buy this camcorder (or anything Samsung).  We've had one of thier digital cameras malfunction on us, too.</review>

<review id="9090">I purchased one and it was DOA. It wouldn't even power up. I exchanged it for another and this one would power up, but it wouldn't mount with their cables or mine. I've owned other My Book drives and generally thought that they were ok, but they must have really dropped the quality control on this one. I'll never buy another My Book after this experience.</review>

<review id="9091">I've purchased and tried to use Dragon Naturally Speaking 9.   Terrible experience, terrible product.  I've been using many, many software products longer than I would care to remember.  Without a doubt, this company has the worst customer support I have ever seen.  Never was able to use it.Please do yourself a favor and save yourself a lot of aggravation.  Keep away from anything this company produces.</review>

<review id="9092">Honestly, I was very disappointed with Breaking Dawn. Twilight was my favorite and I feel like the books go downhill from there. I understood she did what she could with the last book and endings and so forth...but really, she is no J.K Rowling.</review>

<review id="9093">After trying out the hugely-recommended The First Years Hands Free Gate and discovering that it REALLY doesn't fit anything less than 29" (I was shy by 1/4"), I tried out this gate - it had everything included at a good price, it looked nice, and it was 1" narrower than they gate I had previously tried.Unfortunately, I was shocked by how poor the locking mechanism on this gate is. I might use it for a pet that doesn't challenge barriers, but my one year old (birthday yesterday) got it open in under a minute by the oh-so-intellectual process of shaking back and forth on the gate (her favorite gate activity). You see, the tightness of the upper tensioners tremendously affects the upper locking mechanism. Too-tight and mom and dad can't open it. Loose enough for you to get open is also loose enough for the kids to open. Also, when you do get it loose enough to open, I found that it wasn't as firm in the door opening as I would like (the kids leaning and pushing on it could tilt it over).The reason that this happens is that the litle lever/button you pull back doesn't actually retract the locking mechanism. It retracts a wimpy little secondary piece of plastic that is beveled on both sides. The tiny piece of plastic that actually locks the upper portion of the gate when closed is just a spring loaded piece of plastic smaller than a pencil. This piece doesn't retract when the lever/button is pulled. In fact, it isn't even on the opening gate side, but protrudes from the "wall" side of the gate. As an example, I experimented and taped back the plastic piece that retracts with the button and the door still locked fine at several tensioner levels. Taping back the plastic piece that doesn't retract prevented the upper latch from ever locking.You may think the bottom latch would be enough, but it is simply a small knob held only by gravity into a small opening in the base of the gate. Especially given the height of the gate it is easy for kids to get more than enough leverage to torque the gate opening and lift the knob out of the small opening. If you decide to test out just how bad this gate is yourself, get a parent on either side of the the gate to catch your child when they shove through. With the gate pushing back on the child while they shake the gate, they can get a bit spring-loaded and when it opens, they are so off-balance that they rocket through the gate.</review>

<review id="9094">Book three should have ended with the honey moon and Edward making her a vampire. Something like "I'll see you when you wake up" right before the bite. Everything that followed the honey moon was just too much and too...disgusting. When she said "I think I'm pregnant", I almost threw the book across the room. She's what?  Are you serious?  At the end, Meyer made the mistake that so many authors make...she introduced new characters. Far too many characters. She even had to put in a characters list in the back so the we could keep it together. the whole book leads up to a battle that doesn't happen. Bella's change is so un-extraordinary that it makes us wonder why we ever cared about her being turned. All the superpower abilities turn the book into a farse. Is living forever and being able to lift cars not super enough for Meyer? And the Volturi?  Meyer really had something going with the whole "normal vampire" thing. They're just regular people who happen to drink blood, but when she started on this Volturi stuff, she became Anne Rice all over again.</review>

<review id="9096">I purchased this for my husband and it was a huge hassle. The camera itself is fine, but if you want to upload any footage to a computer, good luck. I purchased the ilink cable just to make sure I could do it, but despite having a new, expensive computer and a new laptop, neither had the port necessary to accept the cable. So I had to go to three different stores to find the USB cable necessary. Finally I had video on my computer, but the cd-rom supplied with the camera didn't work. It insisted I couldn't open the main page without macromedia flash, which was already installed on my computer.So, essentially, if you're planning on not having your video on the computer, this camera is fine. Otherwise, it's way too expensive to waste your money on for a whole lot of hassle. I really wish I hadn't purchased it.</review>

<review id="9097">i brought this coffee maker last year , and last year i had to send it back because it would not finish brewing. so they made send back the broken one and a couple of weeks later i received it, well the coffee maker is not working again , and its the same thing the dang cofee maker will not finish brewing, its like i have to turn it on 4 times for it to finish brewing. i really think for the price of this maker we should not be having these kind of problems, so i would say to anyone thinking of buying this dont!!!look elsewhere , its not worth it.</review>

<review id="9098">This product is worthless. Advertised as a good product for "blending up smoothies" ... this only works if you don't use frozen berries. Who can afford to keep fresh berries on hand all the time?  We didn't know what was happening when we went through the first blender and had to get the blender piece replaced because the plastic disc behind the blade came loose and wouldn't even hold after my husband super-glued it, rendering the product unusable.  The replacement part did exactly the same thing.  We're now on our 3rd blender and have been advised by Kitchenaid not to blend anything frozen.  This makes the product entirely useless to us. If you're blending mashed potatoes I suppose this is the product for you.</review>

<review id="9100">They use this at my gym and I thought for the price, I'd get it to have at home to monitor fat loss instead of just the number on the scale.I tried a few times (testing one after another until I got two of the same readings) and didn't change any settings and the fat percent varied up to 1.5% different each time and never got the same reading twice (after trying about 4-5 times).  For $28.00, I would want something that doesn't vary that much.I'm sending it back and will just use my tape measure and the scale to monitor myself.</review>

<review id="9101">I am very annoyed with Apple.  I bought two 4th generation ipod nanos for my kids, and then bought two docking stations with speakers that came with adapters for any ipod.  Turns out that Apple has pulled a "bait and switch" by changing their means of charging without telling anyone, and, as of Christmas 2008, there appears to be no way to charge a 4th gen nano except on the computer.  If I had known this, I would not have bought a 4th gen nano at all -- the whole point was that my kids wouldn't ruin their hearing with earbuds in all the time, and to prevent loss by having the dock. I see this as a huge problem and will be bothering Apple directly with it until they come up with a solution!</review>

<review id="9102">All I can say is that if you do choose to purchase this product, be sure not to buy it from Nothingbutsoftware. First of all they contacted me 4-5 days later after my original message. They were unable to solve my issue and had wasted 4 hours of my life transferring me back and forth from rep to rep. Please be advised, you should read their return policy as any other retailer's because in the event that you receive damage goods they will basically tell you, "too bad". By the way, if your product does not have a product key, Microsoft will tell you it is the responsibility of the retailer to keep record of the product keys along with their product and buyer. I'll post a message when I actually receive an intact version of Windows Live One Care</review>

<review id="9104">I'm glad I waited a while before submitting my review of this product.  Initially this router worked fine for my needs and was very easy to set up.  After a few weeks I noticed that it needed to be reset practically every day.   We are online alot in my house and need a more reliable router. The salesman warned me that this router didn't have alot of range which was fine in my home but the signal is practically lost once you step out on the back porch.</review>

<review id="9105">This product has no self-cooling function, so the manufacturer recommends placing the "bowl" in the freezer for 24 hours before making ice cream, frozen yogurt, etc. However, even 24 hours at 0篎 (32篎 below freezing) before use is not enough to produce ice cream with any solid consistency. The result in my hands has been semi-liquid on each occasion I tried to use it. Other users have had the same experience and suggest making a custard-based frozen dessert, or adding carrageenan, or just putting the semi-liquid into another container back in the freezer until it reaches a better consistency. I haven't yet tried those solutions (I stopped using the device after a couple of sloppy results), but I will have to try again.</review>

<review id="9106">I've been using TurboTax for at least a decade and it's generally been ok.  This year was a major downgrade.  Although the Deluxe version includes the Schedule C form, if you use the "interview" format it will not even make reference to it!  So if you have a small home business, beware.  I'm sure this is an attempt to get users to upgrade to the "small business" version that costs twice as much.  Personally, next year I'll be looking to other products.  I'm sick of Intuit's never ending attempt to squeeze more money out of its customers.</review>

<review id="9109">I had an old bread machine that worked great. Slap the ingredients in and always made an excellent loaf (except when I forgot the yeast one time). This one is cranky and takes a much more precise measuring which is not for me. The beater came loose and I can't for the life of me figure out what happened to it. Called tech support and they promised to send me one. Never got it. Thought Panasonic  had a better reputation. SO I limp along with the bread machine but its not working properly. Disapointed.</review>

<review id="9110">I purchased not one, but two of these routers consecutively -- each time, Linksys technicians told me there was a problem in the firmwear in the device and that I should return it to the vendor. Unfortunately, Amazon was unable to guarantee that if I ordered a third device, it too would not have the same problem. In the end, I gave up and ordered Verizon Fios, which came with its own router. So far, so good.</review>

<review id="9111">$40 USD + $20 USD for customized keys just for a game?  I thought I would like the product, but then when I saw the price, I jumped out of my skin.

<review id="9113">I just wanted to start by saying I just picked up these books last week and finished all three before actually going to a Midnight release party and standing in line to receive my anxiously awaited fourth book of the series and by saying this I am not a fanatic fan just someone who enjoys a good story.  I just picked up Twilight and thought is was a great page turner.  New Moon also managed to hold my attention.  Eclipse was not as good as the first two books but I still was excited to read the fourth book. Well all that I can say is after thinking over this book for the better part of all day today I am sad to say that yes I was dissapointed. It felt as if the author was reaching...just to make everything work.  Things just felt hurried to try and make everyone come out with a happy ending and fell short compared to the wonderful plotlines and character realizations of the first two books. I have thought about this over and over and again I thought this was just an o.k. book.  I felt the author took some things to the extreme and those of you that have read the book know which scenes I am thinking of.  Now I don't know if I will see the movie.I still think S.M. is a great author but Breaking Dawn was just so far from the original idea/concept setup in the first book to really understand and relate to.  In a way I have to agree with other reviews I have read in that it did not even feel almost as if this book was by the same author that wrote the first two books.  This book was just o.k. for me.</review>

<review id="9114">August 15, 2008This external drive was purchased for the large capacity it provides.  The hard drive is enclosed in an attractive two piece plastic case.  One piece mimics the cover of a book and is attractive glossy black.  The other piece looks like the pages of a book and provides ventilation for the drive.  A bright blue LED is located on the front of the drive.  It is divided into two sections that blink in unison or alternately depending on function being performed.  Overall, it is a very attractive unit.  Unfortunately, the case of the unit I received was not fitted together correctly causing one corner on the bottom of the unit to stick out slightly.  This caused the unit to wobble.  In additon to this problem, the performance of the drive was lackluster.  After formatting the WD unit as one large NTFS drive (which took over 4 hours), I compared the WD unit with another external hard drive unit I own.  The other drive consists of a Nexxtech USB external case housing a WD 200gb ATA/100 drive.  The comparison consisted of performing a 7gb file copy from the local PC hard drive to each external hard drive.  The copy consistently took approximately 6.5 minutes for the WD but only 4.5 minutes to the Nexxtech.  At this point, I have returned the unit due to the case defect.  I have not decided yet if I will order a replacement due to the poor performance or look for another model on Amazon.As always, Amazon customer service was excellent!August 24, 2008Decided to order another one since performance was not my #1 priority (though important).  New drive just arrived and has a small scratch on cover right above LED which is annoyingly noticeable because of the shiny cover.  Is it too hard to expect a product to arrive without cosmetic defects?  Bought this unit because of the price but may end up getting an internal drive so that I don't have to worry about cosmetics (not to mention better performance since internal drive will use SATA connection).</review>

<review id="9115">I bought this camcorder specifically to record a conference I was hosting but then a buddy of mine, who is a professional videographer, offered to do it. I decided to return it even though I had not opened it. I always assume when I buy a product from Amazon that there is a 30 return policy and a full refund but to my suprise, Ace Photo & Digital, the company that sold me the camcorder through Amazon, said their return policy was only 10 days and there was a 10 percent restocking fee. They refused to budge even though I spoke to a manager and plead ignorance. So my suggestion is to make sure you check out the company you are buying your product from and read the fine print or else it will cost you a pretty penny.</review>

<review id="9116">Im so so sorry but this book didnt keep pace with the other three. It doesnt even read the same way.This book DOES read like fanfic or sci fi. I could not proudly recommend it to my friends like I do the other three. I just cannot wrap my head around Renesmee. No matter how hard I try.I cannot imagine Bella, who has shown zero maternal instincts (couldnt even keep her goldfish alive for goshsakes) fighting so hard to keep this child. Then Bella drinking blood from a cup with a straw? Are you SERIOUS? For some reason I cannot get past 2/3rds of the story. It was so far fetched. I also feel like it is a total cop out that Bella had very little struggle with her newborn self. She needed to loose control more to be believable.Then Jacob; with Renesmee as soon as he lays eyes on her for the first time? ARE YOU SERIOUS? Jacob thought Renesmee had just killed Bella and now he's in love?And Charlie is ok with the dont ask dont tell policy? He just swallows this? No.No. No. And where was Renee is all this? Sitting by the phone? If your child was so sick she was at the CDC you would not wait idly by the phone.So many little things that added up and turned this book into just a silly story really.There was some humor in the book, thankfully. The ending did give closure but almost in a too good to be true sort of way. This book, overall was a big disappointment to me.</review>

<review id="9117">it is nothing but a container. I returned it immediately after the first use. don't waste your money.</review>

<review id="9118">Most of the 3 star and below reviews here sum up most of what I wanted to say. This book was bad...and a horrible conclusion to a pretty great series.While I had many qualms about this book most (as I said above) are mentioned so I'm going to take this oppurtunity to say something I enjoyed about this book: Jacob's perspective.I hate Jacob, and have never been a fan of his but I congratulate SM on putting it in. It seemed like she really enjoyed writing from someone else's POV and it was funny, sarcastic and sad in all the right points. It made the middle of Breaking Dawn really enjoyable, enough so that I could continue on and finish reading Bella's disturbing and cold ending.</review>

<review id="9119">I think they should have just kept this series as a trilogy.. the fourth book was very disappointing.. how is it that Bella got everything she wanted with barely any trouble (ok ok she went through some pain.. but still!)..</review>

<review id="9120">This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)      Tropic Thunder was not as funny as I thought it would be. Also not as good as past Ben Stiller films.Too drawn out and stupid.Only good things about this movie were Jack Black's performance and the Tom Cruise cameo.</review>

<review id="9121">Loved the small form factor and was even willing to adapt to the poorly laid out keyboard but was never able to connect it via wi fi and when I could it was slow or intermittent. I called the manufacturer and they did not even know what wpa supplicant driver they where using. I also found that it was impossible to edit configuration files in an attempt to make it work. The net book remix is an easy peasy cut back version that lacks the power needed for power users. I se3nt mine back too bad so sad. It says Sylvania on the box but is made in china and supported by a group called digital gadgets not a good buy save the headache get a Dell.</review>

<review id="9122">Buying "Eat This, Not That" for my Kindle was a lesson in buying any book that is primarily graphics-oriented for this medium.  DON'T DO IT.  Until Kindle comes in color and/or has a zoom function, the most necessary parts of this book are illegible - the tips written on the pictures of different foods from the researched restaurants.  I liked the idea of having this aboard as a quick reference guide, but any page with a photo over which text is written literally cannot be read.From a content perspective, this book really is for folks who eat primarily at fast food/chain restaurants.  If you are not among those people, it may have some helpful tips, but by and large it won't be of use.</review>

<review id="9123">The gate itself is a good product.  Buyer's need to know that the manufacturer's box prints that the gate will fit up to 47.5".  The website that I purchased this item, Babies 'R' Us, states that it will fit up to 48".  This is not the case, and we have had to creatively fill the gap to make this gate securely fit our opening of 48" exact.  Just be aware of the true measurement as the stores who sell this product are not always accurate.</review>

<review id="9124">I would bought this one but I am going to return it. Problems:1. When I make hamburgers the grease runs down to the front and then boils and splatters all over the knobs. The spattering grease hurts and the knobs as well as my counter top get all messy.2. When I opened the top cover the grease runs down the top cover onto my counters and the cord in back of the griddler.3. There is nothing to hold the grease cup in place so it is easy to bump the cup and let grease and oil run all over the place.4. Too many knobs - 3 knobs to do the work of 1.5. The little grease catching cup seemed to dissolve where the grease drips, I didn't expect it to last long.6. I checked with an infrared thermometer. There are heat distribution issues.7. The packaging does not give room for the spring covered cord that runs from the top of the griddler to the bottom so the cord was bent at a crazy angle and I needed to spend a few minutes straightening it out. 8. The unit gets really hot on the outside (ouch) and takes a while to cool down, don't expect to be able to pull it out quick to make a meal, wipe it down and put it away.</review>

<review id="9125">If you live in a wooded area (particularly in the northeast US), you might want to use Advantix instead. Advantix repels mosquitoes (and Frontline doesn't), and it also does a better job than Frontline in killing ticks. My dog was on Frontline, but ticks were still crawling all over him. The switch to Advantix has helped a lot.</review>

<review id="9126">Very poor customer service, my correspondent was essentially impossible to understand. I wanted to configure this item as a wireless-n access point, but they were unable even to grasp my question. I eventually succeeded by myself: it worked fine with a 802.11g USB adapter but I couldn't get it to work reliably with D-Link's own 802.11n USB adapter so I'm returning everything. However, I sent them an email query and they answered within 24 hrs with the correct suggestions, after I had returned the stuff.</review>

<review id="9127">A surprise from Cuisinart.  It arrived at my house, and was quite excited to use it.  About 10 minutes after turning it blew a circut and the motor was fried.  Now it no longer works.  My recommendation is seek another solution.</review>

<review id="9128">I've owned three of these brewers and a few friends also own one.  Here's my humble opinion after several years of use:1.  I wish the Kcups were a bit larger so I could make stronger coffee at the larger size.  To get around it, I bought the cup that let's me fill with my own coffee.  I grind it fine and can get a pretty strong cup- even at 15 ozs.2. Most people that use the brewer punch the medium followed by the small fill size to make a 15oz. cup.  Most seem to like the flavor, but I think it's a bit weak.  See point #1.3.  MOST IMPORTANT:  Every Keurig coffee maker that I own has failed.  Even every one of my friends have all had their's fail. This seems very abnormal- even when we've bought ours years apart (it's not just a bad batch).  I've owned these brewers since early 2000 and I just bought another replacement with the same issue. I've had 3 different models- the most recent was a B60. Now I'm trying the Platinum.  The problem appears to be with some sort of sensor that fills the cup which seems to wear out quickly.  The problem starts: either it only fills half way (compared to what it should do) or it just does not fill at all when pressing the flashing fill button. to Keurig's defense- they replace it with no questions AS LONG AS IT's UNDER the 1 yr WARRANTY.   I buy all my coffee from Keurig and they did not give me a break.  I spend approx $75 every three months. That is a bit disappointing.When I spoke with customer service on my last brewer- they told to expect 3 yrs from the maker.  I find this a bit of a problem for a coffee maker that costs $150 (B60 and 70).  why do I keep buying it? Because I have all this coffee that will go to waste and when it works- I like it.4.  I use the brewer at home in my home-based business and everyone that uses it- ends up buying one.  But, we've ALL had problems with the brewer.If it was more reliable, I would rate it a 5, but I'm rating it a 2 because of reliability issues.</review>

<review id="9129">This product still needs a lot of testing. The first unit I received had power problems and had to be returned. The second unit I received has had multiple problems. I inserted 2 x 500GB Seagate Barracuda drives. First off the unit would only see them as two individual drives (even thought they were identical and I wanted to RADI 0 them). I proceeded to format each separately. After I had formatted them and restarted the device it then allowed me to reformat the unit using RAID 0. So, after two formats I was able to finally get the unit up. After I configured the unit I started copying some files across. Since it was taking some time to do I started neatening up the cabling and unfortunately cut power to the device. No problem I thought, the device must have some type of recovery. No, after rebooting the device I got the original screen only giving me the option to reformat each drive separately. So, I went through the process again, formatting each drive separately, restarting the device and then again reformatting as RAID 0. I copied a few files across and then powered the device down using the power button (you have to hold it until it flashes). After repowering the device I just could not believe it. The device was asking me to reformat the drives again. To test this I did the reformat, powered the drive down and repowered it. Same thing. This drive is just too unstable to trust with backups or for storing important data.</review>

<review id="9130">After a couple of months the power connector became intermittent. Wiggling it sometimes helped. Apparently I am not the only one who has had this problem and I attribute it to poor quality control of either the socket or its soldering to the circuit board This part takes a lot of stress as the power cord is plugged in and out of the hub, and needs to be strengthened.The problem can be detected by removing the USB connector to the computer, to be sure you are running on the hub's own power, and then wiggling the power plug on the hub and watching the blue power light. Often it will be off as soon as the computer is disconnected, and wiggling it reveals the intermittent nature of the problem.</review>

<review id="9132">I am in the same boat as many reviewers here - I have had nothing but terrible experiences with this product. But allow me to go more into detail than some-First of all, the design of the product, I feel, is flawed. The D-Pad gives a terrible sensation. Imagine a REAL d-pad from any GREAT controller (console standard ones, usually) and put some duct tape over it. Now you're headed in the right direction. It gives virtually no feedback (I.E., what would be called "travel," the distance your finger moves when you press a button), and it doesn't feel like it "pops" back into position quickly, it just feels like it in and of itself, lags behind.Second, the analog sticks have a great feel, minus one major, major "design" flaw - the opening that the a-sticks reside in is SQUARE. Wheras every controller that predated this one has done it one way, that way being a circular opening, this did it another, which that in itself is fine. But in actual gameplay, this reveals itself to be an enormous disruption - something they would have found if they had TESTED their concept and RESEARCHED their "design." Put your hands on any controller from the current generation of consoles, and just spin the a-sticks. Theres nothing to it. Now, do the same on this pad - "clack" against the top side of the housing. "clack" against the left side of the housing. "Clack" against the bottom of the housing. and so on.If you'll be using this controller for emulation of any kind of game that isnt an rpg, your thumbs WILL slip off of these sticks when they run into corners THEY PUT IN THERE.Finally, my technical experience is as I said, no different. For me though, the first one of these I brought home, I could see once I opened the box that I was not the first to open it. The controller inside had a dead shoulder button, stuck in the pressed position. Returning it, I got another box that, upon opening, was obvious I was again not the first to do so. This one seemed fine, then after installing what's IMO very annoying software, I was able to see its major design flaws. I didn't figure to be using this for anything very "active," so I complacently let it slide.Once GTA3 came out for the PC, I could see its flaws in "active" use, just as everyone at Logitech certainly had. But theres no quality control for snivling mongrels that know better and choose less. I've seen their silence on our complaints, and I know retail - and if the product is already on the shelf, logitech has already made their mone, and don't need to concern themselves while they're laughing their way to the bank.In fact, retailers are still probably selling the first run of these hardwares - when a manufacturer initially produces a product, chain retailers commit to buy x number of thousands of units. Once shipped, the retailer, barring extreme and strange conditions, pays on the spot, in one lump payment, prices far, FAR below what you and I see when we go to buy it. Excepting extreme circumstances, the manufacturer is free of liability from then on, minus their license agreements and quality guarantees to the consumer inside the packaging- -Which have also been shown to be as spineless as anything else they've represented in this product.It was when I played GTA3 that I realized just how much this controller sucked, and that my "refundable" date had passed, and Logitech already had their money, and the store I got this from would be keeping their money from my foolishness, I promised myself I would never touch another Logitech product again.Then the left analog stick went dead.</review>

<review id="9133">I am now working on getting my 3rd Flip from my order. The first one had a known bug -- it would film for about 15 seconds then shut off. After it was replaced by Flip customer service, the replacement stopped working altogether after about 2 weeks. They're working with me to get a 3rd one (hopefully) but needless to say my hopes are not high and I will doubtless be selling this one if they have enough class to send me a new one. Too bad, lots of people seem to like their Flips.</review>

<review id="9134">You could really tell there was a writers strike going on~~the storyline was scattered and this was made worse by the fact that there were only 15 episodes on this long awaited for 6 disc collection.  Why did it take until December to receive this when the first 3 seasons were avalable in September and they had more episodes?  Was it because they needed filler?  These problems along with no reduction in price made LOST the 4th season a disappointment. We will probably rent season 5 instead of buying unless we can get more bang for our buck.</review>

<review id="9135">I got this and the RangeBooster is a lie. It has NOT boosted any kind of range on my network. It also goes in and out of service often. I wasted my money on this one.</review>

<review id="9136">We could not get the bread to rise properly no matter how much we tinkered with the ingredients.  We also tried the exact recipe that turned out beautifully in our old bread maker, but couldn't get it to work.  Must be the rising temparature is not appropriate.</review>

<review id="9137">However, I bought this for my 3-year old.  We played a Little Mermaid game trial on the Disney Website and my daughter loved doing anything that involved Ariel or Sebastian.  I already own the movie on VHS and thought it would be a good idea to get the DVD, especially since it also supposedly contains extras.  The extras are totally for adults who are interested in trivia.  There is NO game--not anything that even closely resembles a game. Though there is a section that says "Games and Activities", there are also NO activities.  This is a LIE.  What's in the area labeled games and activities is a video feature, a "virtual ride" on the Little Mermaid amusement park ride that was apparently planned but never created.  There is "virtually no control" over this supposed feature.  It is in no way a game or activity.The movie is the movie.  We like the movie.  I've now purchased two recent Disney releases which are supposed to be restored.  I don't see a difference.  I admit, I am not trying hard either.  I'm not a video elitist when it comes to equipment.  I'm an average buyer.  I got free lithographs ordering this early from the Disney site, but they had signs of having been handled.  The delivery package had no marks, but the lithographs do.  There is a small crease in the same spot on all of them.What a disappointment!  I had thoughts that I might have put these in my daughter's bedroom somewhere, but with this flaw, I don't know.I don't think I'll be fooled by the next Disney package.  I have all the Disney full length animations on videotape from "Snow White" to "Beauty and the Beast".  I have several on DVD.  Of these more recent "restored" releases, I have two, this and "Lady and the Tramp".  I've been fooled twice.  Shame on me.</review>

<review id="9138">I think the note below sent to Amazon says it all. The coffee maker is defective but not so broken as Amazon "service."----------Okay, now I am really annoyed.You provided a defective product -- a coffee maker that leaks right out of the box.  Okay, stuff happens.But then your system got ugly.When I did the return process I selected the optionUPS pickup: Have package picked up from the address to which it was originally shipped.Instead on honoring that request, your system decided to give me a postal service label and your instructions now say:Give the package to your letter carrier or take the package to your nearest post office for delivery. No postage is necessary if the package is mailed from within the United States.No, this is not user error. When I figured out what was wrong I did some browser backs to check.  I said, "Pick this up."  Your system's reply was, "No way. sucker. Haul it to the post office."Excuse me, but this is no way to treat customers unless you want fewer of them.  Do you really want me to leave work, go to the post office, and return the defective product?  If so, rest assured, I will not be buying from Amazon in the future.-------Based on past experience, I suspect some human at Amazon will get the mess remediated but, alas, the whole Amazon process seems to be driver toward doing business without any human intervention.</review>

<review id="9139">This is not good at all. I don't know why they got so good reviews. I don't care whether on earth they are eco-friendly, but this thing leaks the absorbent material inside the diaper. We will stop using it.</review>

<review id="9140">This could actually be a pretty good stick if it wasn't for the fact that its calibration is constantly getting out of whack. I'm using the stick for flight sims only (mostly Warbirds) and I'm sick and tired of having to press F12 in the game to reset the stick's center position every 20 seconds or so. That makes this stick essentially useless to me.Another thing I noticed is that in the Windows game controller calibration page, the center position is constantly jittering ... as in not quite standing still (as all other sticks I've had to date would). If you need a good stick for a flight sim, stay away from this toy.</review>

<review id="9141">Purchased this based on Consumer Reports saying it was a "best Buy". So far it has not lived up to their rating. I am going to try using a pre-shave product from Remington to see if that helps in getting a better shave. As of now I would not recommend this shaver.</review>

<review id="9142">Having used Turbotax for about 10 years, with this year's software I have been unable to connect online to automatically download the update.  Following their instructions to manually download, I discovered that the download would take over 6 hours, meanwhile tying up the phone line.Contact by "chat" and by email resulted in instructions for connection to download the state that did not work.  Ordered CD versions of the update and state forms through automated phone, which was never completed.  Contact by phone (after 25 minutes on hold)resulted in a pleasant young man agreeing to send the needed CDs. Promised by about 2/19.  Email confirmation said to reorder the state and gave a phone number.This has been an unsatisfactory experience.  If you are on dial-up, start right out by requesting CDs and don't plan on e-filing.</review>

<review id="9143">After reading Consumer Reports and the reviews at this web site, I bought a Zojirushi Fresh Brew Thermal Carafe coffee maker from Amazon in February of 2005.  I was somewhat disappointed at first because we felt the coffee should have been hotter when freshly brewed.  I was even more disappointed when it stopped working correctly in August of 2005. I had paid an above average price for what I had hoped would be an above average coffee maker and it will no longer stay on long enough to brew 10 cups of coffee.  You must babysit the machine and re-push "on" when it stops, after brewing only 2 or 3 cups of coffee. You have to do this several times to get 10 cups of coffee. But my greatest disappointment came when dealing with Zojirushi America.  In order to get my 6 month old, above average coffee maker repaired, I have to get a larger box than the original container, (according to the company the original container is not suitable for shipping) place the coffee maker inside the original carton, then place the original carton inside the larger box with extra padding and pay for INSURANCE and POSTAGE both TO and FROM the company's service center in Calif.  (They have very few service centers in the U.S.) My failure to do so may cause my request for service to be denied. Not very consumer friendly for a problem the customer service representative admitted was one they had experienced before.  My advice - Don't buy the thing.</review>

<review id="9144">The content is fantastic and deserves 5 stars.  I am giving 1 star because it is NOT an extended version and we owners of the original version are being misled and betrayed by the creators of this otherwise fantastic docuementary. Both the original version and this one and both are exactly the same length in minutes.  The difference is business disputes led to the removal of the Esther Hicks (Abraham) interviews from the original and other interviews were substituted in which was not explained until I wrote to the producers trying to understand what the difference was.   (I felt that extended should be like "What The Bleep Do We Know" (1.5 hours) vs. "Down the Rabbit Hole" Ultra-Extended Edition (FIVE HOURS!) and I expected additional length with this too.)Both the original and this altered (not extended) edition of "The Secret" are EXCELLENT.  Both discuss the power of your thoughts, your dreams and where you focus your attention. Anyone who has pursued any passion feverishly to success through all obstacles by truly believing in their passion whether in a career, a hobby, or sport has already used "the secret".   If you find what you are passionate about in life, and focus your attention to manifest it you are on your way to creating the life you dream of.  Again, this rating is ONLY to send a message to the producers about honesty.  Otherwise, the content is so good that I watch this DVD over and over!  Why? Because it really embeds fundamental truths about life and how to live it successfully and shapes behavior toward more productive thinking that leads to greater success and joy in any area of life you put your attention on.  If you have the first one - most of the content here is the same and overall conveys the same excellent message  Buy either one edition or the other and you can't go wrong!</review>

<review id="9145">Blanket was too big in the large size for 21 inch baby at 9 lbs.  They have 2 sizes but no chart to figure out which size you need.  The velcro tabs are small and she could easily slip out.  I'm waiting until the baby is bigger to use it, but we're in the third month and still waiting.  Other reviews have said the small was too small, so I'm not sure.  Would recommend Miracle Blanket; costs more but is one-size fits all and is adjustable as they grow.  Just don't put it in the dryer...</review>

<review id="9146">I've had this router for about three weeks now.  It hangs almost everyday, seems to hang more often when there is more network activity.The only way to recover it is to unplug the power.  It's going back tothe store.  Do not waste your money, pay a bit more and get a linksys.</review>

<review id="9147">Liked the size, and it seemed to work for the two months I've had it.  But the plastic keychain hook broke, so I can't attach it to my keys -- the whole point of having it in the first place.  The place I purchased it from was willing to replace it, but they no longer carried it.  They said to just contact SanDisk, as it was under warranty.  Called them, and they said any physical damage voids the warranty.  So, I'll avoid SanDisk products from now on.  Too bad, as it seemed like a decent enough drive.  I'm just tired of companies that won't stand behind their products.  Next time I'll buy from Amazon, which has the best customer service I've seen.</review>

<review id="9148">Question for the Intuit Board of Directors: How could your CEO and his team so thoroughly botch an update (certainly not an upgrade) of your core offering? As a current update "victim" from QB 2006, I feel nothing but anger and resentment toward your company (for the same reasons listed in all of the other reviews that precede mine). Heaven help you when Microsoft or one of your other competitors designs a better package. Your customers will flee from QuickBooks like mice from a sinking ship. Your product is embarrasing (and over-priced), your business model ham-fisted, and customer service is deplorable. Somebody (or bodies) at a high level within Intuit really needs to be fired.</review>

<review id="9149">I have set up 3 different wireless networks for my apartments over the past 3+ years.  In my current apartment, I had a Netgear 802.11g network working flawlessly complete with Lingo VoIP service , networked printer, and up to 4 laptops connected.  However, the company my girlfriend works for, Diageo, for some bizarre reason only supports Linksys equipment for employees working remotely.  Therefore, I bought this router.  Promises of Secure Easy Setup were anything but that.  The setup wizard on the installation CD crashed on 2 of my laptops during the configuration process.  In repeated attempts to run the wizard, it crashes upon clicking anything on the initial startup page so I cannot even get the process going.  I am not going to bother with what is for sure to be a lengthy technical support call and I am going back to my trust Netgear router.</review>

<review id="9150">Purchased this Acer One Aspire from Beach Camera for about $330. When I took it out of the box and started it up, I noticed I couldt type anything, most of the keyboard keys did not work. I called Beach Camera to see if I could exchange, they said it could not be exchanged and I must go through Acer for it was a warranty issue. I spoke to Acer and they informed me I would have to send it in to them for repair. I of course had to pay to ship it back to them. No other way around it, so I am now out another $20.33 to ship back their defective product and now have to wait about 3 weeks for turnaraound. I would not advise buying an Acer product or buying from Beach Camera, unless you like to spend extra money and time for a defective problem right out of the box</review>

<review id="9151">I've had the microwave for a couple of years but have lived with a malfunctioning carousel for about 6 months, planning to replace it.  This is in a vacation home so isn't even used very often.  And I don't use a microwave for much more than reheating food very occasionally.  Other issue that I don't like is ease of use - not intuitive at all!!  I was surprised to see this model so highly rated.</review>

<review id="9152">I used Turbo Tax three years ago and wasn't happy with all the hidden fees, so I tried Tax Cut and was very happy. This year Tax Cut used the same sleazy tactic as Turbo Tax by waiting till you're almost done, then " by the way, we're going to charge you the hidden $19.95 charge to e-file your state". I'm looking for honesty and transparency in company's I do business with. Next year I'm doing my taxes the old fashioned way.</review>

<review id="9153">After stewing over this for a few days, I realize how disappointed I feel by BD.  I really, really wanted to love this book and am so bummed out that I couldn't.  I don't really have anything new to add that hasn't been said before, but I feel like my favorite characters disappeared and were taken over by the aliens from The Host.The major things that I hoped would happen happened.  However, the way that they unfolded didn't feel sincere to me.  After reading BD, I can kind of understand why the editors encouraged the author to stop with Eclipse; the whole central Renesmee storyline was jarring in itself, and then not fully explored to satisfaction.  However, it's not so much the whole giving-birth-to-a-halfpire and gruesome birth (which was just too much for me to stomach); it's more that the Bella & Edward magic that made me fall in love with the series was but a shadow in Breaking Dawn. So, I'm just kind of bummed out -- and on my way to becoming a Trilogist.</review>

<review id="9154">I thought this book was a HUGE disappointment. I managed to make it through the whiny angsty New Moon which I utterly despised and hoped that Eclipse would redeem it. Nope. Bella is an insult to me because she is a role model for girls my age and she is a whiny, weak, helpless, self absorbed, brat. Never have I been more disgusted by a main character before. She has no independence and gives up education and a successful life for Edward. Edward, the most boring, controlling, pushover vampire of all time. He had the personality of a cardboard box! Why are people so in love with him? Don't even get me started on Jacob! I didn't like him in New Moon but in Eclipse I passionately despise him! He is so in love with Bella for no reason what so ever and is a perverted freak! If I was Bella I would have punched him or something! Why is she so weak and helpless? It disgusts me. And while all this is happening Edward says, "I'm happy as long as Bella is happy,"What the heck? No normal teenage boy would stand around and listen to Jacob's nasty thoughts about Bella and not be upset about it! I think it is incredibly unrealistic even if it is a vampire. The whole book was a waste of time and I did not enjoy it at all. Don't even bother reading it.</review>

<review id="9155">Had to call Linksys to get it setup. Tech person did get me up and running but it took longer than it should of, part of which was my understanding her(offshore call center?).  Not pleased with how she setup my logon on key and when I asked if we could change it, she DISCONNECTED the call.  I also get a message evey time I logon that It can find a certificate for my home network.  Since it will probably cost me to fix both of my issues I am living with it.While it is an upgrade to my old Linksys wireless router it seems much slower!When times comes to upgrade I will surely look at other manufactures</review>

<review id="9156">his product should have never been released. It miss a fundamental subset of Excel, VBA. Suddenly all macros stopped to work after I upgraded, and the unthinkable was correct, yes Microsoft has removed VBA, even from the help! after some online research to confirm, I removed it and re-installed 2004. This is not to mention the huge resources consumption or the new improved, or should say, ugly interface.</review>

<review id="9157">The Waterpik WP-100 that I received was defective.  The watertank only went down to one-half and the remaining water was not able to be used.  Also, the lightest setting, for caps, braces, etc., was still too strong.  I really would like to find an oral irrigator that has a very mild setting.</review>

<review id="9158">I used the Frontline plus on my dog and it worked for about a week.  The fleas returned and I was still seeing them in the house.  I was so grossed out by the fleas.

I feel like I wasted money on this product.</review>

<review id="9159">Have to say that build quality is not solid. fancy cover fell out when I tried to put key-chain thread through: just stick it back, but feel of cheap plastic around. Remind me china design of remote controls: no matter how good the unit, e.g. CD player but supplied remote not user friendly, small buttons, tiny signs overcomplicated reuse of the same buttons, cheap feel and look...would not recommend. Unless you pay below $10</review>

<review id="9160">I've owned this fountain for 6 months... not only does it need constant attention and pampering to get the tender little pump to pump water (it gets clogged because the filter appears further down the line so crap get stuck in it's little grill) it is damn near IMPOSSIBLE to clean.  If you must buy it, plan to take a day off work or maybe a long weekend to get the cleaning job done.  Furthermore, go out and purchase baby bottle brushes in every size... YOU'll need all the help you can get.  It makes me crazy!</review>

<review id="9161">This waffle iron was turning out very good waffles... golden, crispy, everything I was looking for. No problems with sticking or cleanup at all. But at the end of my SECOND time using this thing, it DROPPED DEAD. No lights come on at all. I tried waiting for it to cool down, then plugged it back in. Nothing. The only thing I can think of is that I had the 'darkness' meter turned all the way to the max (5+) during the whole process of making about 10 waffles, and this thing couldn't take the heat. I'm going to try to get a replacement, and be much 'gentler' on the next one!</review>

<review id="9162">I have been using the Linksys wireless router and access card for about three months.  The wireless connection is sometimes not stable (i.e., sometimes does not connect even when it recognizes an available wireless network).  I called tech support to fix the problem.  It was one of the worst tech support I have ever encountered (based in Phillipines).  I called three times, each time wait time exceeded 30 minutes.  All three did not seem to know what they were doing - made me change some random settings (without any explanation) which did not make any difference to my connection.  Their goal was to try to get me off the phone as soon as possible.  All three promised that they will e-mail me an updated firmware as the latest version available on Linksys web-site still has bugs.  I never received any of their e-mails.  I have finally sent in for a warranty exchange.  Hope it works.</review>

<review id="9163">The laptop itself is generally nice, but I had some problems with mine which is why I gave it such a low rating.#1 and most importantly, the synaptics drivers on samsung's site and the one that comes preinstalled with the laptop did not work at all for my touchpad, instead it just made it freeze up and jerk around.  I think I got a defective model, because no one else seems to be experiencing this problem, but so far, it's a no go with Amazon's return policy.  Kinda asinine, paying over a grand for a laptop that doesn't have a touchpad that works all the time. #2 Aesthetics, this laptop ranks pretty high aesthetically, but looks like mine came with a factory defect, kinda noticable, but not a deal breaker. Feels like I bought some jeans from Ross that has the stitching off.</review>

I have to clean it almost every other day b/c the smell gets really bad. also, there is not much room in there for the cats. it is self cleaning, meaning i have to wash it myself to keep it clean. i don't recommend spending the money.

<review id="9166">This is a very convenient and easy to use camera. It fits right in your pocket. It even comes with software that helps you upload your videos online. The picture quality however, just doesn't meet my standards. The resolution isn't high enough. The results are videos that aren't sharp when played on a full size screen (I have a 20 inch). The sound is decent. It doesn't record that well without sufficient light. If you're willing to accept a slightly below-average image quality, then the Mino HD shouldn't be a problem.</review>

<review id="9167">I can't believe there are so many positive reviews of this crate. There are so many things wrong with it.First, someone else already mentioned the clips. They either stick into the cage or they lay on the floor sticking up waiting for you to step on them. What were they thinking?And that brings us to #2. The clips are there because this is portable. What a joke. This thing is heavy. It is difficult to fold and unfold. (Or else mine is bent and/or poorly constructed, either way it's a strike.)There is gonna be flexing metal when you do it too. So it's not a given that you are going to escape uninjured from the process.The handles provided only snap onto bars with certain diameters. Make sure you use THOSE bars and that the handles snap in or you could easily drop this thing. And you're pretty unlikely to escape from that uninjured. Also, because the handles only snap onto the long bars they are not very convenient for moving the crate around when it is assembled.If you plan to take the divider panel when you transport this thing please pay attention to where it comes from when you first unfold it because you'll never figure out where it goes again.Which brings us to #3. Use the divider panel and it will be available from puppyhood through adulthood. Another joke, I think. Any puppy could fit his whole leg through the bars of this cage - all the way up to the hip or shoulder. Try to picture that with a frantic puppy and no injury.Then there's #4. Want to get the door closed fast? Forget it. The locking bars will slide into the closed position. And you can't just slide them open and closed to lock them either. You have to lift the handle in order to be able to slide the lock open or closed. When you swing the door closed the handles swing out allowing the locks to slide closed by centrifugal force. Both locks then have to be disengaged so the door can close all the way and you can engage the locks. That means before you can engage either lock you have to lift the handle on each one and slide it to the open position. How fast does that sound? With practice you might get pretty fast, but it's still a TERRIBLE design.This product was NOT made by dog-lovers. Consumer testing was non-existent. I found all these issues in the first week of use. Keep looking. This is not the crate for you, even at Amazon's prices.</review>

<review id="9168">I bought this product brand new and after only 5 days the drive had a catastrophic failure. I spend over $150 trying to recover the data, but all was lost.Western Digital refused to help me in any way and didn't offer any compensation.DON'T put your life on this passport - it is not reliable!DON'T buy this product!!</review>

<review id="9169">For the most part this software is nice for tax preparation for sole proprietors. It does a good job stepping you through everything and maximizing your deductions while minimizing your errors.However, although a W-2 and 1099 reporter is a listed feature, it doesn't exist on the Mac version, and Intuit makes no mention of this. When I contacted them, they told me tough. It's clear false advertising, and I would have bought a different product if I had known that feature wasn't available. It might not be a big deal for some users, but it certainly is for me and their dishonesty and poor attitude certainly rubbed me the wrong way.</review>

<review id="9170">My review is for the "e5600" which seems to be identical to this one but comes with double handles and heads. The other model is currently unavailable through Amazon and hence the review on this one.I switched from Oral-B 3D. From the first few days of use, both my wife and I (each independently) noticed we felt we needed to "brush" again soon after we were done. There was that little layer of food/plaque or whatever it was that just didn't go away. After few weeks and in spite of regular flossing and min. of 3 brushings most of them exceeding the 2 minute cycle, I found myself reaching for a toothpick to scrape the side surfaces of my teeth. I then ended up buying my FIRST regular toothbrush in over a decade to finish after I was done with this one.By the time it was time to see the dentist, my hygienist for 12 years commented she had never seen plaque like that on my teeth!I really really wanted to like this toothbrush after all the great marketing and hype that goes with this toothbrush, but the emperor is really naked. And no, it coudn't have been a defective brush because we have 2 handles and 2 intelligent users. One of the worst 100$ spent on a personal care item. Please feel free to disagree and post your personal experience with it. I still want to like it.</review>

<review id="9171">This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [HD DVD] (HD DVD)      Unfortunatley, when I received the 4 DVD's they did not work.  Major disappontment since they were a gift. The person I sent Planet Earth invited people over to view the cd's .... no luck.  Plus, it ended a nice planned evening.Still trying to figure out how to return the cd's with limited hassle.</review>

<review id="9172">It was nice-looking and given that I am an avid toaster oven user, I was excited to take one out of the box. However, even before I tried cooking anything significant, after plugging it in, I wanted to duck as it seemed a small aircraft was taking off. . . or at least it sounded like it. This machine was way tooo loud. It went back into the box. I even hoped I was wrong about the loudness and liked the idea of push buttons (in lieu of the dials my old toaster oven had) so, as my husband came home and I took it out of the box again to get a second opinion. His first reaction was "that's horrendous". I sincerely hope it was a shipping bang up and that others have been able to enjoy this product as I have yet to see another review cite the loudness. Just beware. . . that was our issue and this was the first product I've ever had to return to amazon (out of maybe, 50 purchases).</review>

<review id="9173">My 14-year-old daughter urged me to read the Twilight series and the more I got into it, the more I was repelled by the banal writing and the more I disliked Bella.  The author keeps trying to convince us how unusual and unique Bella is, but her actions are those of a conventional, moon-calfy, teeny-bopper with a very conventional crush on the cutest boy in school.  YAWN. You gotta wonder why the hell Edward falls in love with this nimrod if he supposedly is smart and has over 100 years of living under his belt.  The writing style is the same as a bodice-ripping romance novel that features lots of sexual longing, but no actual sex - lots of smoldering looks, but no follow-through, which appeals to the younger teen crowd, I guess. But it gets ludicrous after thousands of pages.  In short, there's a whole lotta sex NOT going on here and it becomes a bore after 100 pages. Meyer stretches out a plot that SHOULD fill 1 medium-sized novel into 4 overbloated ones.  I found myself quickly skimming through these parts of the books and jumping to those that advanced the plot, which quickly became all I was interested in.Meyer's shortcomings as a writer also stand out in her characterization of Bella who, by the end of the 1st book, started to irritate me.  Like other reviewers here, I started rooting for the rogue vampires to catch Bella and give her an ugly, lingering death. Meyer has the beginning of an interesting alternate, magical universe set up in these books.  The rules she's set up in her vampire/werewolf world are intriguing.  But the members of the Cullum family are the only characters that maintained my interest in the book.  I wish Meyer had developed them further, but I suspect she kept them more in the background because she ran out of ideas, choosing instead to spend yet another 50 pages on Bella and Edward panting for each other. (Edward! Go on, already!  Bite her! Get a hotel room!) If you're looking for good writing in the fantasy genre, read Harry Potter instead. Hell, read Stoker's original "Dracula." This series is badly in need of an editor with a giant red pen who could cut out the repetitious passages and banality, but what would be left?  A plot outline, I guess.  I wish a better writer had produced a book based on this plot- the bare bones of it are promising, but the Meyer's follow-through is very disappointing.</review>

<review id="9174">This camera makes a clicking/beeping noise throughout recordings when you're filming something quiet. I contacted the manufacturer (not easy - you have to leave a message and hope you're available when they call you back) and they confirmed they're aware of the problem and hope to fix it in later models. If it weren't for that, I'd have loved it. Unfortunately, most of what I wanted to film was on the quiet side so I returned it and will be shopping for something that works better for me.</review>

<review id="9175">I've been using Syntrax Matrix 5.0 Perfect Chocolate whey protein but because of the great reviews I figured I'd give Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate a try.  It smelled much better so I was really excited to try it.  Boy, was I dissapointed!  It tastes thin and not nearly as much like chocolate as the Syntrax product.  It doesn't mix as well either.  I now have 5 pounds of this that I use only for making homemade protein bars because it's basically not useable on its own.  Seriously, try Syntrax Matrix 5.0 Perfect Chocolate, you'll LOVE it.  Syntrax Matrix 5.0 Perfect Chocolate is so good, you can just mix it with water and it's great!  Try mixing Optimum Nutrition with just water and try to hold back the gag.  It's seriously that much of a difference.  This is a classic case where smell doesn't translate to flavor at all.  All of those people saying how good this stuff tastes should try Syntrax Matrix 5.0 Perfect Chocolate.  Do a double-blind test, try both with just water, try mixing both, no contest.</review>

<review id="9176">I attached this USB drive to my company ID and lanyard.  The green loop that you see on the top side (which is intended to allow you to carry the USB drive on the end of a tethering device) broke off in 2 days.  It is very thin, weak plastic.  Now I have to just tote the drive around in my laptop bag.  Pretty low price, so I got what I paid for.</review>

<review id="9177">I bought this hub a few weeks ago and it seemed to work great at first.  The only thing's I've ever connected to it are the data adapter for my cell phone and my USB thumb drive.  I leave the phone data cable plugged into the hub all the time.  After a week or so, plugging my phone into it would result in the phone not being recognized by Windows.  To test it, I plugged in my USB thumb drive.  No go, wasn't recognized either.  I broke out the power adapter and plugged it in thinking it might be a power issue.  Bravo!  It worked after that.  Then I shut down my PC last night, come home this evening to turn it back on, and I find that my computer won't get through POST.  At this point I'm freaking out thinking there might be something wrong with my PC.  I troubleshoot it intelligently by unplugging the most recent thing I added to the system: this hub!  Bravo!  My PC boots just as expected.  I'm using an older Intel D865GBF motherboard.  Maybe that has something to do with it.  So far the hub has been more trouble than useful.</review>

<review id="9178">These diapers are the most awfulest things I think I ever bought for my baby. I received a lot of the "swaddler" size for my baby shower and I tried to use them for about 3 weeks before my pediatrician pinpointed it as the source of the relentless diaper rash my son had pretty much from birth. Stopped using them and lo and behold, diaper rash gone. Fast forward 3 months later when my son was hospitalized for a week and these were the only diapers the hospital supplied. Figuring that my son was older, maybe they wouldn't do as much harm. Wrong. The rash came back with a vengeance. I had to get diapers from home for the rest of the stay. I think it's because they are lightly scented with green dye inside. Definitely stay away if your child has sensitive skin!</review>

<review id="9179">I purchased this camera because of the great reviews, and boy was I sorry! I am a mom just wanting a small camera to take with me on the go. This looked like a good camera. I took some videos inside and they were grainy. Then I tried loading the installed software on my computer and it wouldn't ever load. I contacted customer support, and they were not helpful at all. Then my power button ended up locking up, and I couldn't ever get the camera to turn back on again. Also my computer was messed up for about a week after trying to install the program. I returned this camera and purchased the Kodak Zi6 and I love everything about it! The video quality is much better, even indoors. And Kodak's software is easy to install and very user friendly. The Flip camera needs help!</review>

<review id="9180">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)      I completely disliked this movie. I can't believe it manage to be the second highest grossing movie of all time. Warner Bros really lucked out when Heath Ledger died. I am not trying to speak ill of the dead but let's be honest Warner Bros is probably thinking the same thing. Christian Bale is the worst Batman ever. Heath Ledger was okay but too dark for my tastes.  I personally will always prefer Jack Nicholson as the Joker. I can't believe they replaced Katie Holmes!! Why didn't they just do what they always do when a actor decides not to come back and say she died sometime after Batman Begins or she got a job 1000 Miles away or something. I hate when they replace characters and act like it is no big deal. IT IS A BIG DEAL!! The storyline was all over the place. Things were included that could have been left on the cutting room floor, like the part at the beginning with the Scarecrow. I probably not be so utterly peeved about this movie if it had not been a waste of TWO AND A HALF HOURS. This movie had plenty of scenes they could have lived without. So for everyone who wanders where the Deleted Scenes are for this DVD, they didn't leave anything on the cutting room floor, it all went in to this LONG movie. They didn't want to leave out one scene of the Joker, again to capitalize on this young man's unfortunate death. We all know there will be another Batman movie, I hope they do what they have decided to do with the Superman Franchise. Scrap everything they have built in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Get them some new actors, and a decent writer (Will Bryan Singer please stand up) and start anew. I am just glad I did not buy this movie, I strictly rented it.</review>

<review id="9181">I tried this product on a stray that showed up at the house. The dog was in poor condition so we took her in but she had a problem with chasing the cats and running off across the road. I got the collar in an effort to prevent her chasing the cats and getting hit by a car. The collar however at its highest setting doesn't even phase her, she just keeps doing whatever she was doing. The beep will always get her attention if she is within about 10 yards but after that shes gone again. Also I had a problem with the fact that there is a delay between the time you push the button and the time it actually sends the shock. The delay is about 5-10 seconds. I think that is too long because every now and then she would either stop the behavior on her own and then the shock would come or she would get out of range. I tested the collar out on myself and it does shock but again there is that delay. Also I am not sure that the collar actually shocks everytime you push the button due to the delay I have to watch her carefully to see if she feels anything. Sometime she will flinch when shocked but it is not enough to make her leave the cat alone or to prevent her from running across the road. I will state that this is not because she has no training she seems to infact have had obdeince training and will come, sit and stay when she is in a controlled location. Once she gets into the open though she simply ignores all commands. It might work on a dog that isn't quite so intense or stubborn, but I wouldn't purchase this product again.</review>

<review id="9182">This USB adapter appears to do its job OK, although the signal reception is (of course) poor compared to adapters with proper antennas.The software has one major flaw- a horrendous memory leak that renders the PC unusable after just a few hours. This kind of fault should never have made it out of the Linksys software group, and yet they have done nothing to correct it in the YEAR that this software has been on their website.I would not buy this product again.</review>

<review id="9183">I pre-ordered this set and received it today.  The picture quality is terrible.  I've been watching the series on Discovery HD and was anxiously awaiting the release of the original BBC series and was not happy with the video quality.  I bought the regular DVD series, but the edges of everything were blurred together.  I watch regular DVDs and get better quality than this.  Perhaps it was a bad run of the DVD set as they might have been rushing to put it out?  I am using a progressive scan with HDMI upconversion and have a 52" 1080p LCD set.  Maybe I will just wait until the HD war is over and get it on the preferred format??  Any other issues like this?</review>

<review id="9184">Like so many others here, I was very disappointed in this book. I never saw the "feminist" aspect in Bella, but if anyone else ever did, it is lost here. I suppose most of my discontent is in the "fairytale" ending- where everyone gets to be happy forever. One thing I enjoyed about the previous three books in the series was the reinforced concept that decisions lead to consequences, such as:1. It was always clear that Bella chose Edward, and in so doing was giving up other aspects of human life- children and family; to me, those options were only viable if she chose Jacob.  It seemed like a cop out. 2. These two men, Edward and Jacob, are in love with Bella. She makes her choice, and someone is going to get hurt. I realize this is fiction, but I liked that for once not everyone was going to live in perfect bliss for all eternity. It never works that way.I was impressed with the recurring theme of compromise in the series. Yet with this book, on one has to compromise anything- life, love, or happiness. I always liked that Bella wasn't the typical insipid female intent on a husband and 2.5 kids- she adamantly resisted matrimony for three books, that she is not THAT girl. Then with the pregnancy we see her become a completely different person, and give up EVERYTHING else that she was and happily becomes her own worst nightmare. I wish I had stopped reading after book one.</review>

<review id="9185">We bought one of these to curb the barking of our 45 pound Pharaoh Hound.   It works on the barking.   Unfortunately, it also goes off when he's playing, etc.   Now, he won't even touch some of his favorite toys.   We need to stop the barking, but not at the expense of destroying our dog's personality.   So, this item is going back.</review>

<review id="9186">My son REALLY REALLY wanted this gaming keyboard and was very excited when it arrived....  However, the one thing they do not mention in their notes is that this keyboard is NOT compatible with all gaming systems....  Customer support for this product was slow as well, (need to send an email and wait for a reply), too long!  I can say the product looked nice and arrived promptly and safely, but we never got to use it!  Actually it's all backed up and ready to go back!</review>

<review id="9187">I bought this product to replace a Linksys G-router which started giving me frequent disconnections (about every minute or so).  I decided to upgrade to this N-router thinking I would have MUCH better and faster speed.  WRONG....With the G-router and G-adapter, I always had a strong signal from where my desktop computer was in relation to my notebook computer.  With the N-router and N-adapter, I now have a "LOW" signal.....same computers, same locations, etc.  I even went out and bought another identical N-adapter but had the same results.  I spent several hours configuring the channels, etc., including using Linksys' Chat service.  Nothing solved my problem.  Tomorrow, however I'm going to solve my problem by taking all of this back and getting a different router and adapter, whether by Linksys or another company, I'm not sure yet.  I do know that I was VERY disappointed with this router and the adapter.</review>

<review id="9189">This review is from: Tropic Thunder (Video On Demand)      The only reason I watched this movie was because Robert Downey Jr. was in it. Watching Ben Stiller play next to Robert Downey Jr. was gut wrenching to say the least. Robert Downey Jr. preformed flawlessly of course and carried the poor script and most of the scenes as much as possible. Ben Stiller was horrible however, proving once again that he has no acting talent what so ever. Tom Cruise pulled off his disguised nasty producer part pretty good except for his dancing scenes. I have seen several of Ben Stiller's movies and he just never seems to get any better. Someone please drag him to acting school and chain him a desk so he can learn something. Can I have my movie rental money back please?</review>

<review id="9190">Wow, I see a running theme here.  I firt bought the controller a couple of months ago.  After a couple of weeks the left analog controller went out.  It wouldn't respond at all.  I took it back and got a new controller thinking the one I had originally was just defective.  A couple of weeks later it went bad too.  The controller is great when it works.  But the sad thing is that it doesn't work for very long.  Worthless.  I thought Logitech made good stuff too.</review>

<review id="9191">So I bought an iPod Touch 2nd gen 16G for my fiancee's birthday. I bought it from apple because they have free shipping and free engraving. It was also the same price as Amazon. Anyway, I was very impressed by Apple to begin with because the iPod was shipped from Alaska to my home in Jersey in less than two days. So I get it out of the box, and it's a cool new toy at this point, and start playing with it. Programmed it, synced it, photos, videos, wallpapers, album covers, you name it I got it on there to surprise her with it. She loved it from the get-go and started using it immediately. One week to the day I received it, the screen froze and I figured it wasn't a big deal and I reset it. Needless to say, it didn't like that... So, the technical genius that I am looked up and printed every troubleshooting guide I could find. I reset it again and the only thing it would do is tell me to connect to iTunes. And that's exactly what I did. iTunes said that the iPod was in recovery mode and needed to be restored. As anyone with an iPod knows, when you restore an iPod, EVERYTHING is erased. OK... I will take the loss of a few hours and follow restore procedure. I waited an hour for restore to be completed and it wasn't. I unplugged the iPod and started again. Apparently, Apple states that restore can take from 1 to 4 hours to complete. I decided to try and restore again, but this time I waited for 5 hours for it to complete. In the first 5 mins, it looks as though it may work. Restore configures the iPod, creates backup files, updates iTunes and sends the information to the iPod. When the iPod receives the information it needs, the progress bar on the iPod reaches 100% and iTunes displays a message in another window that states "waiting for iPod" with a progress bar underneath the message that stays empty. I don't get it. I tried a different USB cable, reloading iTunes, even called customer support. Customer support said to take it to an Apple store and exchange it for a new one. If I send it out for repair and Apple cannot fix it or if I wanted another personalized iPod, I might get a refurbished iPod in return. Tomorrow I am going to the Apple store and I expect to just get another Touch. I am very disappointed with Apple and I should expect a solution to this problem soon because I have heard that there are many more people with this same problem. If anything changes, I will post another review. As for now, I have a $300 paperweight.</review>

<review id="9193">I've heard good things about this product, but it didn't make a difference in our home. Our year-old (neutered) male treats our older females like prey, and generally causes a lot of stress. We tried it in the bedroom first, as that's where confrontations often happen (and where all 3 of them spend time), and moved it to a more central locale in the hallway towards the end of the month. I'm sorry to say it didn't seem to make any difference whatsoever to the situation. Maybe we had it in the wrong location?</review>

<review id="9195">This product is not good for your cat. It does not come in a frontline box first of all. Secound if you would please take the time and read the back of the medication it says dog. All the information with this says cat this and cat that. It is not for cats. If you call the manufactuer they clearly state cat and dog are very different. Do not use this on your cat. Thirs they charge you a 15% restocking fee and shipping back to them. Do not waste your time would never buy from this seller ever again.</review>

<review id="9196">It worked fine at first - i was using it to play Devil May Cry 3 for the pc, but after about a week the calibration of the analog sticks started to go bad. At first, on eof the analog sticks was slightlty less responsive in one direction (i couldn't run left). This progressed to the point that the controller moved on its own ( i saw this looking at the logitech software for it)I took it apart and repaired/cleaned it (iv done that before on other things). It worked slightly better the first time i did that, after that, cleaning it had no effect.I strongly discourage purchasing this product.</review>

<review id="9197">For some reason, this unit burned itself out after six months and only about a dozen uses. It was great up until it almost caught fire, never to work again. It was always used according to the instructions: never more than half full of kernels; always popped dry without oil or butter. I would NOT buy this again.</review>

<review id="9198">This book references many restaurants that aren't anywhere around my area (and we have tons of restaurants). Its ok as a general topical guide on what types of foods may be better for you than others, but, I certainly wouldn't call it any kind of comprehensive collection. A lot of its pages are filled with pictures rather than words. Don't be taken in by all the hype this book has received. I think its just that.</review>

<review id="9199">Note: this review is for the second generation macbook (1.1/2.4 dual core/2G RAM), and is not the current one. The Airport problems seem to have been resolved with the more recent macbook versions, but the rest of this tale still applies.I am typing this review on my macbook so I can't say that I hate it. I have been tempted to throw it out the window many many times, however.You can read about how great it is from other people. My experience is more of a cautionary tale of what can sometimes go wrong with Apple products.This machine has had several card replacements including the airport card. Oh, and the case cracked too. Airport (Leopard) still doesn't work that well. And the battery now will not hold a charge. Applecare doesn't cover that because it's considered a consumable item and I've recharged it too many times.Moral: buy, but you MUST purchase Applecare. They really really need to get their quality control in hand.</review>

<review id="9202">My purchase of this pedometer was really emotional and I still regret it even though it's not that much money.  It seems like an OK product but I can tell you that the technology is not that sophisticated and it's impractical to carry around with you every day.  It looks like a pager when you wear a suit and the clasp doesn't hold even the thinnest belt that good.  I'm not going to go on and on like other reviewers but I suggest you buy a stopwatch and time your walks...this way you can use your watch or carry a timer in your pocket.  P.S. I cared so much for this little device that I haven't been able to find this device after the first week of use.</review>

<review id="9204">As other reviewers have mentioned, the second two books in this series do not compare to the first. I feel obligated to write a review, because I feel as if I wasted my money on them, and would like to warn others away. Read the first book, Twilight, only! It is very unique and I enjoyed it very much, even though I am not what you would call a vampire-are-hot-romance novel reader.Sadly, things slowly went downhill after Twilight. But I hardly noticed this after I read New Moon. I was still happy with the series. It wasn't until Eclipse that I realized what happened. ALL the characters, it seems like, are immature. Especially annoying to me is Bella's dad. I would expect the adults, at least, to act like adults. And why is Bella constantly cooking?!? (Although at every mention of this, I usually love it, because it makes me laugh.) It seems to me that the author decided to try to push her beliefs on her readers. If you are a teenager, you should not have sex until you are married, go to school and get straight A's, and cook for your irresponsible parents. Oh, and if the love of your life treats you badly, you should become severely depressed and become an automaton. God forbid the main character show she has a backbone (like she did in the first book).This is such a shame... And there was so much potential here for a great story! The werewolf-vampire thing could have been the best part of the story... and if only SM had kept the friendship of Bella and Jake as a friendship! Imagine the tension if he really was her best friend and just wanted to look out for her. Enough of this love nonsense. Bella really is a nothing character, she doesn't even have the spunk she had in the first book.Oh well. I am an optimist, so I will look into the 4th installment of this series, but I will definitely not buy it unless I hear that Bella has grown up. Unfortunately, I suspect that the series is beyond saving.</review>

<review id="9210">I've learned many other people experienced the same problem my family had with this unit. There is a plastic gear on the top of the base unit that transfers power from the motor unit to the cutting blades. It can and does shatter into pieces. Customer service can not or will not offer a replacement gear and instead they offer to sell you a new base unit for $30.00 plus $10.00 Shipping. This unit is over priced, breaks easily, and emits a burning smell if you run it continuously for over 30 seconds. Just to let you know, this unit was adult operated and not abused. The gear broke while mixing a protein shake (milk and powder) I wasn't grinding apples or crushing ice like they claim is possible with this unit.</review>

<review id="9211">This review is from: Transporter 3 (Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      Transporter 3's lead writer (Luc Besson) has a thing for redheads. I came to this conclusion after watching Transporter 3.  I'm a big fan of Besson's science fiction foray, The Fifth Element, and all I could think as I watched the slinky, thickly accented Valentina (Natalya Rudakova) was how Transporter 3 would have been so much better if it had been Milla Jovovich in the role. That I was distracted by the stiff Rudakova's acting is a testament to how much the film insists on zooming in on her, letting her drone on and on in her broken English, and the endless patience that Frank Martin (Jason Statham) seems to have for what amounts to a rich brat in a miniskirt and heels. Oh right, the plot.  So anyway, Martin is a wheelman who does jobs with certain rules. These are all meant to ensure success in Martin's job as a wheelman.  By the time we reach Transporter 3, every one of those rules has been broken.And that's the problem.  The rules made Martin interesting. In Transporter 3, Martin has become a walking parody of himself, fetishized by the director to strip away (literally) everything likable about him, only to replace it with beefcake shots of Statham with his shirt off, whip-cut fight scenes that don't let us see his martial arts prowess, and aggravating supporting characters whom the Martin we know from the first movie would have left on the curb.The gimmick here is that Martin can't just run away from his job because a super-advanced device is connected to his wrist that will blow him up if he is more than 75 feet away from the car. For reasons that only make sense to movie villains, Martin is forced to drive Valentina to a variety of locations, during which they track him constantly.  That's right, the bad guys track Martin's every move.  In fact, the movie is obsessed with keeping Martin in the car to the point that the entire universe seems hell bent on keeping him in it. Even the laws of physics are in on this cruel joke, which helpfully bends its laws to allow Frank to do ridiculous things like drive his car on two wheels, float it to the surface using air pressure from its tires alone, and land it on a moving train. The generic villain Johnson (Robert Knepper) is a victim of the So Bads.  As in, he's So Bad that:... he kidnaps drunk college girls!... he shoots his own men when they asks stupid questions!... he's helping sneak toxic waste into Europe!That's right, uber-villains can now hit a new low: they're not just mean to you, they're mean to the environment!The movie just spirals from there.  Valentina, patently unlikable, somehow seduces Martin, who doesn't show the least bit of interest in her.  Given that the ransom picture of Valentina shows her in a schoolgirl's uniform, there's at least a ten-year difference between her and Martin.  Ick.There are so many logic fallacies that you have to wonder if Besson's just mocking his audience. Statham as Europe's answer to the Kung Fu martial artist is just plain awesome -- I loved him in The Transporter and was willing to forgive the silliness of Transporter 2 -- but this is too much. Frank Martin deserves better.</review>

<review id="9212">We were so excited by this product, it worked very well for a while and suddenly stopped working. I did not want to go through the hassle of getting it fixed because of the price I got it. I probably would have wasted a lot of time to get it fixed.Conclusion: that was unfortunate but I would not by another one of the same type.</review>

<review id="9213">I used the Furminator on two different cats - one with Maine Coon-like long hair and the other short. Notwithstanding that both cats equally despise this brush (but love their regular brush) it seems to work a lot better on the short hair.  The LH cat, OTOH, it pulls out the tufts of hair that I wouldn't get with the regular brush, but the cat still walks around with poofs of her fur flying everywhere because the Furminator just doesn't grab the hair the way the regular brush does.  I wasn't impressed with this product and was even less impressed with the obvious price gouging going on.  It's just *not* worth the money because I see no discernible difference between this cutesy named product versus a regular wire brush.</review>

<review id="9215">I just purchased this computer this week and have had a terrible time with download speed when using wireless.  I've tried it on several different networks.  I've tried it right next to the router on each network.  I've tried sites which will test my connection for me as well as other sites.On each network, I've tried it where it was the only computer being used as well as head to head against a laptop with another wireless connection.In a typical instance of where both the wireless computers were using the same standard, I initiated a download of 248 mb with one laptop and 7 mb with the asus.  The 248 mb download finished before the 7 mb download with plenty of time to spare.  Also, I've tried downloading the same file from the same place with both laptops.I'm getting absolutely terrible response time from the asus.  I will call support about this problem, but if it really is a limitation of the laptop, I would not recommend it to anyone other than as a word processor or something like that.  I don't expect to be able to do high-intensive transactional applications, but I expect to be able to use it to wirelessly connect to the internet and surf at a reasonable rate.I will update this review if something is found which will increase the speed of the wireless.  Other than that, it's a decent computer so far, but it gets only one star because of such an important flaw.</review>

<review id="9217">When run on one of my two USB hubs, my HP Vectra won't get beyond half way on Windows 2000 startup.  On the other hub, it takes about 5 minutes to get beyond the HP startup screen and will then get through Windows 2000 startup if, and only if, there's a zip disk fully inserted in the drive.  I think this will be my mobile drive and I'll spend half as much on an AC-powered model for my desktop.</review>

<review id="9219">We bought this machine a year ago and have kept it because we paid so much for it.   Sure it is easy to use, but the coffee is never hot enough.  Within the first 15 min of it being made it is sort of hot, never piping hot, and an hour after it is made it is only warm.   Today the twist on top to the carafe broke and we are so happy to have an excuse to buy a new coffee maker.   For sure it will NOT be a Zojirushi.</review>

<review id="9220">I bought a cheap 75 gig drive a few years ago from comp usa and that works fine when I plug it into a mac and then turn around and plug it into a pc. But when I did it with the lacie, that was it. The pc wouldn't even see it. And then when I went to plug it back into a mac, it wouldn't recognize it any more. Now I have a 900+ gigs of footage that I need to make my demo reel t get jobs, stuck on the drive. And no money to pay someone to get it off. LACIE sucks. I should've learned from my job when one crashed, but thought it was just my co-worker messing it up. She probably did, but Lacie still sucks, get something else or you just might regret it.</review>

<review id="9221">Yes, the government should provide this software free. Hiring some software engineers should have been part of the "bailout." That aside, do not be mislead by the OS requirements listed for this software download on Amazon. It is windows only. It suggests that under the product name, but when you click on the "system requirements" link it lists Mac OS 10 etc. The software certainly exists for Mac, but not for download on Amazon. The downloader needed just to download the software is windows only. Mac users can head for the back of the Amazon bus. Well, actually they can't even get on this bus.The software is actually ok, other than the price. I will just have to get it elsewhere.</review>

<review id="9223">SummaryI ordered one of these hoping that it might meet the same quality standards set by the last ThinkPad Laptop I owned, and whilst I was impressed by the features and ease of setup, I was not impressed by the quality of the item.Features & QualityThe keyboard is a very compact size and fits a normal USB plug. Out of the box, with no additional drivers, the keyboard, trackpoint, and trackpad were all supported by my Ubuntu Feisty box.However, the key feel quality was poor, and patchy across the keyboard, with an inconsistent feel between keys, and a generally flimsy feel. For the money, I would expect a more solid feel, much more like a real laptop.In comparison, the keyboard on my Dell M65 is rock solid and *extremely* high quality in feel. In turn this is beaten out by the Mac Book Pro keyboard.</review>

<review id="9227">I purchased one of these about a year ago.  The price for an 8MB Flash Drive looked like a fantastic deal at that time.  The cliche "You get what you pay for" now comes to mind.  I have owned at least six different USB drives over the last three years and this is by FAR the slowest of any of these many times over.  8MB is a lot of storage, but it takes FOREVER to write large files to this drive.  I would strongly urge anyone considering this drive to spend the extra money for a faster high capacity drive if you will be copying large files to the drive on a regular basis.  I regret trying to save money with this drive.  It's really that slow.</review>

<review id="9229">I miss my Welbilt terribly.  After spending months reviewing machines I settled on this one and am disappointed.  I never let a machine do the cooking - I only use them for the dough setting because I am picky about the texture - so I went for something less complicated and less expensive than the Zojirushi.  It is okay for white bread or pizza dough, but a dough that is more dense (i.e., wheat of any kind and ratio) will bog down the motor and stop it.  I have tried two wheat loaves with different ratios of white to wheat flour and both did the same thing.  The pan also does not lock into place; this does not seem to cause problems, but is just weird.  I had my Welbilt for over 10 years and it never had a problem with any dough and I really put it through some big, heavy loaves!The yeast dispenser on this one is utterly useless - it only holds a teaspoon.  Most of my breads require 2t - 1T of yeast.  Maybe I just need more time to figure it out, but hesitate to move on to my more complicated artisan loaves.  I probably should have coughed up the extra for a Zojirushi since I make a lot of bread.</review>

<review id="9233">I bought this because it had good reviews for accuracy, and because I liked its features, but it has been a disappointment.  My primary desire was a pedometer I could put in my pocket, rather than on my waistband, but when it's in my pocket, the accuracy varies tremendously.  (It's advertised as working in a pocket, or in a purse or pack.)  I've been putting my old pedometer (a Digi-Walker), on my waistband for comparison, and sometimes they're together, but they've also been as far as 3000 steps off in a day, and I *know* the Digi-Walker is accurate.The other feature I liked was being able to download all my information to my computer.  I have Windows Vista, and knew this did not come with Vista software, but I saw that it was downloadable from the Omron website, so I went ahead and made the purchase.  The download was easy, but installation became a nightmare.  It kept saying it couldn't find a certain file, but the file was there, and in the path specified.  I finally called Omron support, and their solution was for me to pack up the pedometer and send it to them for them to check out.  Huh?  The issue was with either their software, my computer, or operator error.  The pedometer was not at all involved, but the person on their help desk absolutely could not hear that, and would not back down.  I gave up on her, and kept trying to do the installation, and after at least 10 tries, I did get it to install.  (I might add I have a good computer, and a fair amount of computer expertise, so really think this was an issue, either with Vista, or with the Omron software.)I do like the software and what it will do.  If the pedometer were accurate while in my pocket, I would give the whole thing a 4, due only to the software installation issues, but it's pretty useless since I can't depend on it.  I did try wearing it on my waistband, too, but I found it's really too large to do that comfortably, and I didn't see a lot of improvement in accuracy, as it's so large, it wouldn't lie flat.</review>

<review id="9234">Straight up do not waste your money on this product.  I bought the Video Game Jockey in order to play my XBox 360 on a computer monitor, and the quality was absolutely terrible.  Furthermore, the audio/visual lag was still a problem.  Afterward, I bought a cable made by XBox that plugs into the console and goes to VGA.  This cable works beautifully and preserves picture quality very well.  It also helped to eliminate A/V lag.  You should be able to buy the cable at any Best Buy or large electronics store.</review>

<review id="9236">I like the increased speed and options vs my earlier version of PaperPort.  I don't understand why I am not allowed to create new scanning profiles (a rather petty way to punish folks that don't buy the Professional version?). I couldn't get any meaningful presales support, and now I discover that product support costs $10.00 per event. The is a free knowledge base if you dig for it, but contents are minimal.  There is not even a way to submit a topic or FAQ for consideration.    My HP scanner works OK with PaperPort, but after completing a scan, the process automatically starts all over again.  I have to cancel the second scan to get the results of the first one.  There's nothing useful in the PaperPort help features or on the Nuance web site, and no way to get help with a program BUG without paying for support.  I've used PaperPort for over 10 years and I generally like it.  I am increasingly incensed at the way Nuance treats their customers, though.  When will they get the message?????Follow-up to my initial post:  I finally found a way to get ONE free tech support "instance" via a toll call to 407-241-1823.  After four hours of troubleshooting, the Nuance rep just told me not to use the problematic features!  He then blamed everything on my HP scanner drivers, which the PaperPort database says are current. The default windows "WIA" driver has the same problems, but Nuance doesn't recommend using them either. During the troubleshooting process, all of the items in my PaperPort "Send To" bar disappeared.  All attempted repairs failed.  Athough my HP scanner worked perfectly with PaperPort 9, one bug after another appears in Version 11.  Get version 9 -- don't upgrade to this version!  (I was told a patch is available that allows creation of more than four profiles.  If you have PaperPort 11, try to get them to send you that patch!  I don't believe it exists.)</review>

<review id="9237">This router is slow and unstable and I had DHCP IP-address issues with it (both wired and wirelessly and with both Windows XP and Vista). The price is right but you definitely get what you pay for with this PoC. Save yourselves some heartache and get the Linksys WRT54GL (and load Tomato).

<review id="9238">We have had this crepe maker for about a year, and although it makes great crepes, the teflon surface is seriously peeling off (enough that we can no longer use it) after just about 20 uses.

<review id="9239">Bought Flip Video Ultra on October 30, 2007. Unit died on February 6, 2008 just a few days after the 90 day warranty expired. Connects to and is recognized by computer but simply does not transfer anything to or from computer. Very unhappy, would never buy again. Also, the original software loaded on it was obsolete when I received it, updated that, and now discover yet another emergency update is needed. Problem is emergency update also will not work.  If you buy this item be sure to also buy a usb extension cable (if you do not you will have to physically hold the unit in your hand while plugged into your computer or risk having the usb arm break off the device). Also has no port for allowing use of SD cards etc to expand video capacity. Very unhappy. Buy something else.UPDATE: June 13,2008. I was finally able to reinstall the software that comes built into this video recorder, overwriting the software that was originally on it.  It now works fine.  One additional warning is that you cannot just plug and unplug this recorder into your computer. You can plug it in, but when you remove it you must either shut down your computer first, or use the "Safely Remove Hardware" program on your computer.  If you simply unplug it like many other plug and play items you risk damaging the internal software. When it works it does a good job.</review>

<review id="9242">I have been using this particular jump drive for several months now and am quite unhappy with it.  I use it as the primary storage of important files that I like to keep with me so I can access them at work or at home.  However, it has happened several times now that one or more of my files have become corrupted.  Luckily, I back it up regularly on my PC's hard drive so I haven't been totally hosed.  The previous jump drive I used never had this problem.  I'm also not thrilled about how it retracts into the housing, leaving the end open for dust and/or dirt to get into the USB connection.  Better to find a product with a real cap to cover the end.</review>

<review id="9243">I bought it hub to use with my imac 24" after I read so many great reviews.The hub worked ok in the beginning without any problems.  I had the AC adapter plugged in to make sure that the power is enough for all devices.  I have 5 things connected to it: 2 USB external drive (own power supply), iphone, SD card reader, Sony T1 camera cradle (has own power supply), and a printer (own power supply).The device looks great and I didn't have any problem with the blue light.  However, after 2 weeks of use, problems started to appear.  1st, the SD card reader won't work, even though the light is on.  I had to connect and reconnect the reader.  Then, my iMac couldn't recognize my USB drives from time to time.  This problem was fixed when the drives are connected to my computer directly.  The problem is actually quite annoying and was made worse when running Windows off VMWare off the USB drive via the hub.  The last straw was whilst I was installing windows software on the USB drive, the drive got disconnected.  Had to reboot.I already exchanged 1 hub with Amazon.  BTW, the service was fantastic!  I would not buy from anywhere else.  But, I am returning my second one.  If you have any good recommendation, please post it here for other readers.  Thanks!</review>

<review id="9245">I agree with all the other reviewers here who found Office 2007 to be a HUGE disappointment and an absolutely frustrating dog to use. Gone are the familiar commands and icons we've all become used to with Office 2003. Gone is the ease of use. Gone is the familiarity of the previously great user interface. I can't imagine what Microsoft was thinking when they launched this awful product. It is most certainly a big step backward in productivity and is easily one of the most frustrating software products to use. Do not buy Office 2007! You'll definitely regret it. If you already did install it, then uninstall it now and go back to Office 2003. At least 2003 allows you to get things done in a reasonable amount of time without heaping stress and frustratiomn upon yourself. Sorry Microsoft - you really blew it this time!</review>

<review id="9247">This review is from: Quantum of Solace (DVD)           I never liked James Bond and "Quantum of Solace" just furthered my dislike of the movie series.       Compare James Bond to Jason Bourne, two out of the three "JBs" in spy movies (Jason Bourne, Jack Bauer, and James Bond). Jason Bourne does not sleep with any woman he can find, he feels his kills and does not kill for no reason, and is not a cold-hearted killer. James Bond is all of those things and more. He strikes me as a very dangerous and unkind person. Why would you want to make movies about someone like that?     I'm not disparaging the acting talents of Daniel Craig in any way, or any of the previous actors, but I think the whole premise of James Bond is flawed. That doesn't mean they're badly made movies, they're not. But they're morally irresponsible. And, in the world we have today, we don't need more of that than we already have.</review>

<review id="9248">Purchased this product a year ago.  It's now broken for the 2nd time.  It easily gets clogged (even when cleaned) and it's a nightmare to unclog the minute grounds.

Also, it doesn't get the water as hot as I'd prefer.</review>

<review id="9249">This is my first review of a product ever, only because I feel so disappointed with this product. I've been using a Braun Synchro electric for about 4 years and have been looking to upgrade. After reading the positive reviews for the Pulsonic (and ignoring the negatives) I went out and put down the almost $200 for this razor. Here's are the pro's and con's, at least in my experience:Pro's: Great looking razor, comfortable fit in your hand, and the base unit is smaller and cleaner in appearance than older models (the base is also somewhat smaller, if you're tight on room). Yes, it is loud but no louder than other Braun's - it is definitely louder than a Norelco I've used but unless you live around light sleepers it's not a big deal. It is very responsive to your face, as the head has multiple moving/adjusting parts to it so it does hug the contours of your neck and face well, which is great for sensitive faces. The cleaning system is also much improved, meaning it doesn't clean for 20+ minutes and go through fluid as quickly if the razor doesn't require a heavy cleaning, which is something I liked.Con's: I think Braun sacrificed comfort and sensitivity for closeness of shave on this one. I was REALLY excited when I first got this, thinking it would be the best shave I've had. After the first shave I was a little disappointed, but thought I'd give it another shot. After a week, I quickly realized it wasn't as close as my older Braun Synchro. To test it, I shaved immediately following with my Synchro and it picked up a lot more hair quite easily. I was shocked, and sad that I had to return this. Since all the blades on the head move so easily, it's just hard to get in there and get that close stubble - it always looked like I had a day's growth after finishing with this shaver, which isn't good enough - especially given the high price. If you are just looking for a fancy shaver that gives a decent cut and is sensitize to your face, this is a great choice. If, however, you're looking for a very close shave - this is not for you. Whatever you do, make sure you can return it to where you purchased it so you can try it out - I'd hate to have not been able to return this after my test run with it. I really wanted this to be my Christmas present for myself this year - instead I'll just stick with my Synchro until something else comes along.</review>

<review id="9250">I bought one of these a couple of days ago thinking it would be really nice to have such a tiny device, but I have now changed my mind.What's good:1. It's small and cute.2. It appears to be well sealed against water and dust.3. It comes with file compression software if you like that sort of thing, although most types of media files (photo, video, music) are already compressed, so you might not see much of an advantage.What's not good:1. It's TOO small. Since it's about the size and approximate weight of a postage stamp, I'm afraid I could lose this thing in an instant. If it falls in between the sofa cushions, it's gone. Also, the smaller-than-normal USB connector is always more difficult to insert than a standard connector.2. It seems more fragile than normal flash drives.3. It's not very fast. I tested the file transfer speed against the Memorex TravelDrive 1GB. The Sony took 134 seconds to move 1GB of data, and the Memorex did it in 74 seconds.4. It costs more than just about any other 1GB drive.So, goodbye Tiny and hello TravelDrive!</review>

<review id="9251">I like the idea of these diapers more than their design. It's great that Seventh Generation does not use bleach. Love it. Bleach is horrible for the environment and for the humans that live downstream. But they are not as absorbent as Pampers and they don't fit as well either. We even had a batch that the velcro tabs kept coming off. I'm disappointed. I had hoped we'd found a greener alternative to Pampers, Huggies, etc. But they just don't work as well. We're going to use BumGenius 3.0 and use disposable (boo! hiss!) Pampers for overnights and travel.</review>

<review id="9252">I have been a loyal Dragon supporter since the early years.  I am a physician who uses voice recognition for dictation into an electronic medical record.  Unlike prior versions which would support dictation into any application, Version 10 will not allow you to dictate into an electronic medical record.  Instead they want you to by the medical version for $1000.00.  I would bet money it uses the same engine.  I can afford to by the medical version but as a matter of principle, this is bogus.  I have a very mature user profile and Version 10 did not seem to "learn" all of my previous vocabulary.  For docs using Preferred for medical transcription into and EMR, do not upgrade, the improvements are probably not worth it.  You will have to dictate into Dragonpad and cut and paste into the EMR.//flj</review>

<review id="9258">I purchased this unit because I gave my daughter the D-link DIR 655 unit I had (which worked extremely well). Since I needed a new unit I decided to give the WRT600N a try. Everything started very well. The installation was easy and intuitive. Networking is set and you're up and running in a few minutes, or so you thought...My wife's PC is connected to the router via the 1GB Ethernet and naturally this connection is very fast. I have a ReadyNAS network storage device that is also connected to the router via a 1GB Ethernet connection. This is our central storage where we keep our files (movies, music, documents, e-mail, etc.). This connection is also very fast. Working on my wife's PC is fast and easy (I have a 7Mb ADSL internet connection from Qwest). The wireless network is another story altogether. My wireless network has many devices connected to it - PS3, Squeezebox, my PC, my laptop and my wife's laptop. I set it up with WAP2 security. There are no walls to speak of between those devices as we have a large open space between our leaving room and office. My PC is 10 feet away from the router, the PS3 and Sqeezebox are 20f away... As it turns out, the WRT600N router is horrible at supporting streaming media over it's wireless network, period. The performance is choppy, inconsistent and gets worse as time goes by, so much so, that I have to reboot the router periodically. It is worse then the original linksys router I had before I switched to D-link. It is really bad. Absolutely no comparison with the DIR 655. So guess what I am doing? My experiment is over and I am getting another D-link DIR 655 device. The DIR 655 performs significantly better (as rated by all professional reviews I read on the net) and does not have any of the side-effects I described above.</review>

<review id="9259">I purchased this unit in mid November and 45 days later the sanitizer quit working.  While I enjoyed the unit very much I have to give it a low rating as I believe that for items that cost as much as this should last longer than 45 days.  I requested a replacement from Amazon, and was promptly told "sorry it is over the 30 days...go see the manufacturer".  Too bad for me.</review>

<review id="9260">I regret purchasing this DVD because mine was printed on a low quality media, DVD-R. Instead of being super psyched and making a quick purchase, I should've read the product description and/or reviews prior. I would've waited for the next release and avoid purchasing something sub-par. I guess that is what you get for being a fan boy...</review>

<review id="9261">There is a reason why this movie wasn't nominated for many Oscars and those few were for technical items.  The first half is a sappy comedy and the second half an over-wrought mess.  Australia is a beautiful country but it seemed that many of the vistas were green screen and digitally generated.  Jackman might be a good Oscar telecast host but he will never will an Oscar himself.</review>

<review id="9263">Don't do it.  This kitty box is a great idea but extremely poorly executed.  It spills litter all over the place when you rotate it (the clips don't hold the top on tight enough) and if you overfill it you end up with a scoop full of perfectly good litter that you have to dispose of. In addition, the box is small so cats generally will track more litter onto the floor than they would with smaller boxes.  Even if you use a kitty rug, as suggested by some other readers, your bathroom will soon look like a disaster zone.  Not worth the money or effort.</review>

<review id="9264">This machine has a sensor determining when your wrist is on a level with your heart, which is not a necessity on any blood pressure machine.There is not even one inch of leeway - if your left hand is not precisely to the right of your heart it will beep angrily.  And you have no idea what to do.</review>

<review id="9265">The router was easy to install. That is where the problems begin. I get low strength signal when I connect to this router through a wireless network card in my laptop. My neighboor's connection is more reliable and has better signal. The router constantly disconnects if you use password protection for connection. It also lags and loses packets even if connected directly to a PC through a cable. My friend got the same model and she has similar problems. I would NOT recommend buying this router to anyone!</review>

<review id="9266">I bought this to stop my 4-year-old son from sucking his thumb. It worked like magic the first 2 days, but then I guess he got used to it, because it works for about 10 minutes after application then he's back to sucking his thumb. It definitely tastes bad. I guess it depends how dedicated your kid is to sucking his thumb! It's worth a try, though.</review>

<review id="9268">Don't bother.  This isn't even a real DVD, it is a cheap copy of a DVD.  If the people who manufactured this DVD had bothered they could have fit a 1080i version of the movie on a single DVD9 and given you Blu-Ray quality for a DVD price.Instead they took a low quality 480p version of the movie and just ran it off onto some spare blank DVD-R's they had lying around.  You can get a higher quality version of the movie from iTunes than what is included on the DVD.  It is a complete and total rip off.Tell the producers to get back to me when they feel like putting together a quality product.  I threw this thing in the trash after one viewing of this low quality pixelated garbage.</review>

<review id="9270">I doubt my dog hardly blinked with this anti-bark device activated. She just barked and barked. It seemed not to trouble her at all and was definitely not a deterrent. I wish it had been, but I can't say it's so.</review>

<review id="9271">As an atheist, I just want to say...wow. Is that the best you've got? The blurb on the cover says "THE SHACK will leave you craving for the presence of God." Genuinely curious, and with an open mind, I started reading. So you get four chapters of folksy family fun, culminating in what appears to be a shocking murder -- these scenes are rendered well enough, and I (the father of a young girl myself) felt the protagonist's anguish well enough to keep reading. Then, abruptly and with a deafening grinding of gears, the book veers off into the weeds, where it remains firmly wedged for the balance of its page-count. Ponderous and inpenetrable, jargon-heavy and utterly lacking in anything resembling a narrative, it's sort of like a cross between a Thomas Kinkade painting and the second & third Matrix movies -- winsome and twee, but utterly tangled up in the minutiae of its own mythology, blundering blindly forward with its shoelaces tied together, firing platitudes and cod-philosophy around in the vain hopes that some of it might hit home. Whole pages, whole chapters go by, with the author staggering around in a kind of fog of theology, apparently trying to resolve age-old questions but instead writing things like "Guess that's jes' the way I is" and "Don't confuse adaptation for intention, or seduction for reality." And so it wears on, chapter after chapter of clunky dialogue about ill-defined concepts which are picked up and dropped like the toys of a hyperactive child, apparently seeking to clarify but succeeding only in obscuring all meaning in a lavender cloud of unicorn farts. By about chapter 6 or 7, the Missy plot seems like a distant memory, and the reader's only concern is to get out of this book alive. As a novel, then, this is a laughable effort, but I know it is not primarily intended to be a novel -- it is intended to be a recruiting tool, aimed at winning non-believers over into the theist camp with a sort of warm-n-cozy new-agey version of Christianity, in which the Holy Trinity are a kind of nonthreatening multicultural sitcom family, a trio of irascible kooks with hearts of gold, etc. etc. There may, I suppose, be some hypothetical atheists who are so close to rock bottom that they glimpse some sort of salvation or meaning in this book. But seriously, I doubt there could be more than a few dozen.So go ahead and feel free to give this book to a 'lost'/'seeking'/'fallen' friend or family member. Make them part of your secret 'Missy Project' (as touted on Young's website), earn a few more bucks for the author and rack up some points with the man (sorry, woman, er, no, I mean women, or do I?...) upstairs. Just know that the lucky recipient will, the next time you see them, give you an amused (or bemused) look, and say something like "Um, yeah, thanks for the book and all," while backing slowly towards the door.If this kind of arcane, ill-constructed, mush-mouthed tripe is what passes for serious Christian writing these days, I'm quite happy to leave you to it, dickering over the True Nature of the Trinity or the exact temperature of Hell -- instead I'll smilingly opt to brush off a copy of Middlemarch or Howards End, or maybe a spot of Vonnegut or Wodehouse, and get a bracing, swooningly beautiful dose of the real meaning of life.Good day.&lt;closes shack door with a relieved 'click'></review>

<review id="9272">This is a good scale other than the body fat percentage IS way off. I work in a weight loss office and we have a machine that cost thousands of dollars and many hand held units that cost only fifty dollars a piece. Those units (all seven of them) have my body fat at 22%. This machine reads 32%. I also read 22% with the use of calibers. The odds of 8 different methods being incorrect and this machine being right are not good !</review>

<review id="9274">We purchased a new laptop and downloaded the trial version of Microsoft Office on-line.  The trial ran out before we ordered the permanent software.  When we went to order it, one of the options that came up was Amazon.com at a much cheaper price than downloading it from Microsoft.  The product came promptly -- and we could not load it on to the computer because there was no product code.  To get any help from Microsoft we would have to pay $49.95.  We contacted Amazon.com who very quickly replaced the software, however it still has no 26 digit product code required to download -- So it appears that in order to load the product on to our computer we're going to have to pay Microsoft for service -- so we've wasted over a month and not saved any money.  This is not the fault of AMAZON.COM.  They have been very accomodating.</review>

<review id="9275">I was excited to try these strips as i'm such a fan of the premium strips but couldn't find them.  so, i got these.......first of all, i don't like how both the top and the bottom strips come in the same pack...if you don't want to do both at the same time, you have to somehow slide them back in the little package to save them for later.these strips do NOT cause any sensitivity-a positive.they do stay on and don't slide....they are, however, TOO sticky and gooey.  they actually hurt my teeth when i was trying to pull them off after the 30 minutes.....the glue is just too much!  then, it remains on your teeth.I will not be purchasing these again...i don't see them as a good whitening system.</review>

<review id="9276">This thing was the worst buy I have ever made. I bought it because I have come to trust Norelco and Philips for quality and living up to their claims, but the bodygroom is just awful. The trimming option, what I mainly bought it for, works terrible. It's flimsy, awkward, and just doesn't trim well. I tried to shave with it figuring it might make up for its lack of trimming quality that way. I was wrong. It kind of pulls the hairs, making it feel uncomfortable if not plainly painful. On top of that, the shave is nowhere near as close as what a regular razor would do- I would have to use it twice a day to look smooth, and it takes forever to actually get that close shave. I know it says that it takes time to adjust, and that you should give it 3 weeks, but it was so bad I wouldn't have given it another day. The only good thing is that Philips has a 60 day refund policy, which I am taking advantage of today. TERRIBLE PRODUCT</review>

<review id="9278">The transfer of federal tax data to the state return had an error. The error was not mine, my federal return had correct info. First attempt at "live call" help said the system was down due to high volume. I guess its best to call after the tax season. I tried e-mail and the response was they needed more info and told me to call. The call sent me to the Phillipines and language difficulty. The final answer I got was to correct my state return by pen and ink and mail it versus on-line. I won't use Turbo Tax next year.</review>

<review id="9279">I don't get HBO at home, but I heard many positive reviews of the series on blogs (Instapundit and Volokh Conspiracy) and the radio.  I pre-ordered the DVD collection, which arrived in time to enjoy with Father's Day.  I certainly did enjoy the story and the acting.John Adams is an interesting person to take us through the story of the birth of the USA.  You see the run up to the revolution, the union of the colonies, the war and post-war diplomacy, and the struggle to stay united.  And if your a law buff, you learn quite a bit about the basis of laws in the US, while enjoying a great production.I give 2 stars because I'm annoyed with HBO commercialization of the DVDs.  They used DVD locking features, typically used to force viewing of copyright notices, to force viewers to see a 5 minute commercial for other HBO miniseries (actually includes segments of John Adams).  It's really bad that this was done at all, yet all 3 DVD's have the same required viewing before you can get to the menu.I thought the point of HBO/cable was to pay money by the consumers to get product without commercialization.  I purchase DVD's of various network series, so I can see productions without commercial interruption.  Word-of-mouth was more than sufficient to get me to purchase this series.  Please, don't ruin a great product with crass commercialization.If you want to put trailers for other series on the DVD, no problem.  Provide a link on the menu.  Many people enjoy viewing trailers, so certainly include them.  Just don't make them mandatory.</review>

<review id="9281">I've been buying Turbotax products for years, based on Turbotax's promise to pay any interest or penalty charges caused by any errors that its software makes when it calculates your return.  Boy, was I shocked to learn that -- in practice -- Turbotax makes you jump through so many hoops (including providing them with an upload of the original, many years-old, computer data file or ENTIRELY redoing that year's tax return using new software that they provide) -- that it may be virtually impossible to get Turbotax to make good on its promise.  This year I was assessed an interest charge by my state because of a mistake that Turbotax made in my 2005 state tax return. The printed copies of my tax return clearly showed that an error had been made by Turbotax.  But -- so far -- after I spent hours providing Turbotax with everything they required but was unable to re-create the exact same error on the (corrected?) software that Turbotax re-sent to me (I no longer had a copy of the original software), Turbotax hasn't reimbursed me a cent.  So much for their advertised promise of guaranteed accuracy. This seems to be just another case of consumer fraud. If anyone else has had difficulty in collecting on Turbotax's promise to pay interest and penalties in case of errors on their part, please let me know.  Maybe we can file a class action under deceptive/unfair consumer practive law.</review>

<review id="9284">If I could rate this product zero stars I would.I purchased and installed Norton 360 2.0.  After installing the product my Windows Vista PC blue screened.  I contacted Norton support and wasn't able to receive the support I needed to fix the problem.  After several hours, I was able to restore Windows so that I could log in without the PC blue screening.  I purchased an external hard drive and immediately backed up my files.  I had cancelled my order for Norton 360 so I proceded to uninstall it.  After I uninstalled Norton 360 I was not able to see my network.  If this happens to you, download the Norton Removal tool (pay attention to directions regarding programs affected) and run the tool.  After the tool ran, I was able to connect to my network.  I spent an hour with Norton support regarding this problem before I solved it on my own and they were useless, they didn't recommend trying the removal tool, they told me to contact my ISP even though I was connected via another PC, during one chat they requested to connect to the affected PC that wasn't connected to the Internet!  Buyer beware!  If you do decide to go with this product make sure your PC is backed up and that you have created a restore point to go back to.</review>

<review id="9285">tiny keyboard and blurry screen that is so outdated looking in HD world took away all of my motivations away. It's just not productive. It's such a crap and not doing fast either.

<review id="9286">I've used TurboTax for many years to do our taxes, usually without incident or with only minor issues to deal with.  Not so with the new TurboTax 2008 Deluxe edition.  Apparently, this is a major rewrite.  And there are some major problems.We ran into a problem when trying to check for errors, access the State or Print tabs, got the following:DIALOGUE ERROR (in red caps)Loading: Msxml2.DOMDocument.3.0After working with support, downloading a new version of the software, uninstalling/reinstalling, etc., no change.  The bottom line is they can't resolve the problem.  I'm not interested in using their online service, so I'll have to try a different product and return TurboTax for a refund.I have no issues with the folks I worked with in support.  They were all friendly and helpful, escalating the issue, etc.  But in the end, I still have the problem and I can't do my taxes with the software I purchased.  The 1-Star rating is being kind, can't give it less.  Product failed to function properly.</review>

<review id="9287">yep, it looks great, has a really cool plug design, heats quickly, makes a nice 'ding' noise when it reaches the boiling point and reliably shuts off immediately after that- but the plastic smell and the taint it puts into the water make it useful only for boiling water that you use for....something other than drinks you can taste.</review>

<review id="9292">I had this router for over a year.I have been working through Netgear since January 05 trying to solve the problem of my internet connection peridically dropping. I have tried a sheet full of possible solutions. The Netgear support tech told me it was probably a hardware problem and I should send it back for replacement as it was under warranty. When I called Netgear they refused to replace it because it was not under warranty anymore! I bought it last June (04) started having problems 7 months later (under warranty) and was finally told in July to replace it, but it was no longer under warranty. I will never buy from this company again.I have since switched to the Linksys WRT54GS and have had no problems what so ever. No dropped connection and excellent wireless coverage.</review>

<review id="9293">I have used PaperPort 6 and 9 and decided to try version 11.  This version is slow as molasses!  If you have more than 30-40 scans in a folder it takes a long time to open the folder and if you switch between folders with a large number of scans you just wait and wait for the thumbnails to reload!  A huge waste of time.  Switching from a file in desktop view to thumbnail view also very slow.  The current image stays, then fades away as all the thumbnails RELOAD.I am going back to version 9.  I do not have time to sit and wait for version 11 to decide to respond.</review>

<review id="9294">Somehow Norelco actually made the HQ9 SpeedXL heads worse than the old lift-and-Cut heads.  To make it look like the heads will produce a faster shave, they reduced the area of the outer ring to make room for two additional cutter rings inside the outer ring.The problem?  The inner rings have a slower surface speed than the old, larger area, outer ring.  So you actually have a smaller high speed cutter area while the inner rings end up pulling your beard hairs when you try to shave as fast as your old Lift-and-Cut shaver.Why can't you buy the old lift-and-cut heads to fit you new Smart-Touch shaver?  Like all Norelco rotary rasors, each model uses a slightly different drive pin to make you buy the newer, more expensive, heads.  Philips knows how to make their old products obselete so you will buy the new "better" stuff.</review>

<review id="9302">People with more power and influence than the self aggrandizing Bill Mahr have tried to stamp out God throughout recorded history. Get in line with all the other failures Bill. This film is not an open-minded search for knowledge; it is a narrow minded quest to mock God and all forms of faith. Nietzsche beat Bill to the 'God is dead' punch line a long time ago.

I was so disappointed that I returned it.</review>

<review id="9304">The directional pad simply sucks. I've only had it for a day, and despite the overally comfort and setup ease of this controller, the directional pad is another one of those &quot;nearly impossible to just hold up without going diagonal as well&quot; pads. You push up, and 95% of the time you will either be going up+right or up+left, and ditto for all other directions, down, left or right.... its the most frustrating thing in the world, ever try playing a game like Silent Hill on one of these controllers? Its a nightmare (no pun intended)</review>

<review id="9306">I bought this one because I wanted a new memory stick with more capacity than my current one, and from the advertised read/write speeds I expected that it would be faster as well. When I wanted to copy a folder full of files to the stick - a job of 10 min usually - this would have taken over one hour. According to the manufacturer's forum, this is not a defect. Other people experienced the same. Figures from my measurements: Write speed for a single large file: 6 MB/sec. Read speed for a single large file: 20 MB/sec. Interesting is my normal use case, for example 400 files of average size 10 kB. My several years old 128 MB stick achieves a write speed of 50 KB/sec for this. The OCZ only 6.5 kB/sec! This makes it 7x slower than my old stick!</review>

<review id="9307">I read the reviews on this before I decided to purchase. I am an amateur photographer and wanted something small and light to display my pictures on and also to use browsing the web. It did a good job with both of those things. My pictures displayed beautifully on it. Web browsing was OK, not that it was slow, it is just that on a 8.9" screen the text was a bit small for these 50+ eyes. Keyboard was great and the touch-pad was easy to get use to. I loved the fact that I could pair my PDA with this unit's Bluetooth connectivity to surf the web. The SD slot eliminates the need for a card reader. The speed issue really wasn't that bad provided you turn off all that useless eye candy Vista provides. However the heat issue was a real killer. Not only was it burning hot on the bottom, but even the keys on the top were uncomfortably warm. Only 3 days after I got it, I decided to reboot it. It comes back up to the HP POST screen and freezes. Restarted it again and nothing. Only after it had completely cooled down did it come back on. After a few days of this it just stopped booting all together. HPs online help was no help. I am sure I could get HP to fix this, but even if they do, I think the heat issue will greatly shorten the life span of this unit. Mine is going back. My advice is to pass on this. I hear there a new processors for these UMPCs that run cooler and better powered.This is a real shame. This is a good size at a great price point. The eee pc is too junky and the Sony offering is too pricey.</review>

<review id="9308">Fairly easy to put together.  Within two days the unit started to make lots of noise; vibrations, grinding, etc.  This unit is obviously not put together very well.  I recommend buying something from this company in stores to avoid the hassle of shipping back for refund/exchange.</review>

Not worth the cost of electricity to run it. Pay a little more, and get a better quality fountain.</review>

<review id="9310">Just as a warning- there will be spoilers in here. And there will also likely be lots of incoherent sentences. I need to vent. I can't help myself. Let's begin with the wedding. Everyone thought it was going to be such a big deal and that it would pretty much be the main point in the book. But no. The event we all have been highly anticipating happened within the first 50 or so pages in the book. Then she gets pregnant. Pregnant. That's right- pregnant. I heard the rumors, saw the spoilers, even accidentally came across some of the scanned chapters, but I still didn't believe. I thought there was no way that Stephenie Meyer would have Bella, the girl who practically raised her mother and who cringed at the thought of marriage, get pregnant. Then she gets pregnant and she freaks out for a second. Um, let me tell you- I'm 18 and I'd have a heart attack, perfect vampire husband or no. I know the whole point is that Bella is always strong and doing what no one expects but PLEASE. Then there was the whole "all bodily fluids are replaced with venom, sperm dies, vampires can't have babies..." SM quote that people kept coming up with on the spoiler messageboards. What happened to that? I snorted, audibly, at the section of the book that explains this away. Correction- tries to explain it away. I read fanfictions that talked about this and every time, I xed them out because I thought it was ludicrous. I don't have to tell you my devastation when I realized that this would be central to the book. I understand why SM decided to have a Jacob POV section, though I didn't like it. I got that we had to see things from this angle for the story. But did there have to be SO much? I put it down so many times through that. This is BELLA & EDWARD's story (even though that seems hard to believe a lot of the time). Edward. I know it sounds silly but I feel like he was barely in it. I feel like none of the characters were really IN it. They all seemed miles away from who they were by the end of Eclipse. Alice, one of my favorite characters, felt really far away. I felt like Bella & Edward's love story got lost somewhere and then every once in a while SM would go "oh, let me pop in a significant glance!" They had fleeting romantic scenes, but most of them failed to ignite the spark that the others in the series had (and those were more chaste, for goodness sakes!). Ch 20 in Eclipse lives on.Then Bella's shield. First of all, it annoys me that throughout the series, various obstacles have been placed before the characters that they stress over the entire book and yet, in the end, nothing happens. At all. Twilight was the only one where a little something happened- Bella gets attacked. New Moon was okay in the drama department. Then Eclipse comes along and the scene with Victoria happens in about two pages after all the hype. Then in this book we finally see the Volturi again, the threat that has been hovering over everyone since New Moon. What happens in the end? Nothing. They retreat. Aro apologizes for bothering them. Though the book ends on a note that things might not be completely over with the Volturi, we won't ever see that. Now for Jacob's imprinting. All I can say on this is why? I've read the other reviews that have talked about this so I feel like there's nothing more to be said on this subject. One word will suffice- ABSURD. Oh, and WRONG.The thing that really disappointed me the most, and that I already mentioned, is that I felt like we didn't get much time to spend with Bella & Edward as they once were. I felt like I was dealing with two different characters entirely, though some characteristics were still there. It was just weird.I've heard people complain that the message SM sends out is all wrong but I never really paid attention to it until now. Sure, at times when reading the series I'd ask myself, "Doesn't this girl have any other interests besides Edward?" but then I'd remind myself Edward was a god and that, had I been in her shoes, I'd probably be pretty dazzled myself. But still. No one in real life is as perfect as Edward. Then, when I read this book, I finally got what people were talking about. Bella doesn't even mention college after she's changed. She has no other interests or desires other than Edward and her child now. I get the love and the bond and the inexplicable feelings that come along with that but I can't help but feel bad she has nothing to herself. It actually sends out a really bad message, especially in today's world. Edward is consumed with his love but he still has some hobbies, like his music.Enough rambling. All I really wanted to say was that I was very upset all of my anxious waiting was for nothing. The disappointment I felt when I realized all of those horrific spoilers were true was acute. I can understand now when people spoke of boycotting it and now, I only wish I had followed in their example. My memory of the series is marred now and I'll think of my own ending after Eclipse. I'm happy there was a happily-ever-after but I couldn't feel anything at that point for the characters. They just didn't feel the same to me. Anything would be better than this- even fanfiction.</review>

<review id="9311">This is a product that specifies that it is a non-commercial version when you get it, but does not say that before you purchase it.   What are the limitations of a non-commercial version?  It really does little more than the word processor and spreadsheet that come free with Windows.  This version is not compatible with Office 2003 unless you download an update from the Windows site.  I can not do this download at work, so I can not work on documents at home and then continue them at work. There are virtually no significant improvements to this suite compared to the 2003 Version.  I would recommend stay with Office 2003 if that is an option.</review>

<review id="9312">I, like so many others bought this router before I became aware of all the problems with version 5.  I spent over 3 hours during a period of two days on the phone with tech support (in the Philippines) going through all sorts of completely useless changes to the configuration.  I even received such ridiculous suggestions as "Just take it back and exchange it, not all of them are bad."  Ooh, that was helpful. Finally, in a rage, I insisted on speaking to a tech in Irvine, CA where the company is based.  In less than 15 minutes the very knowledgeable tech immediately recognized my problem even admitting that it shouldn't have taken so long for them to route my call to him.  He emailed me a file containing a firmware upgrade (version 1.00.3 that has yet to be released to the public) helped me through the upgrade and the router has been working fine since.  That's the only reason I gave it two stars instead of 1 since it actually works now.  Probably better just to steer clear.</review>

<review id="9314">This review is for the Single Disc DVD edition... box/packaging.The DVD is housed in 100% cardboard/paper with no plastic at all.  The box is flimsy with the disc sliding into a scratchy cardboard sleave.  The middle insert wouldn't pull out cleanly because of a flap of cardboard they put in it with a security chip on it (this got ripped off immediately.)  The middle insert doesn't even fit in the outer box correctly.  It is an embarrassment to put this nasty paper box on my DVD shelf.I expect way more from Disney.</review>

<review id="9316">Given the great reviews this grill has, I was really excited to order it and have way to grill in my small apartment. The first few times I just made burgers, and all seemed well...but as I grilled more steaks and chicken, the weaknesses of this grill really came out. Let's start with the smokeless claim...it is smokeless, up to a point. At the lower temperatures, it does seem to be fairly smokeless, but I found that these temperatures were just too low for me. I cook (and especially grill) with high heat, so I crank this when cooking steaks or other meats. Two problems emerged: not enough heat and too much smoke. Both were unacceptable.Now cleaning...I grew to despise cleaning this device so much after just a few uses. Sure, the top is a nonstick surface, but the underside of the grill surface is where all the grilled-on gunk accumulates. I tried all kinds of scrubbers and brushes, but nothing could get out all the burnt on mess. And if you don't scrape and scrub every little bit out then, you guessed it, the grill pours out smoke the next time you use it as these little bits burn. I've moved on to a new apartment where I can have a little Weber Q, which I truly love, so the Sanyo grill will never see another day of action. Bottom line: even if you're an apartment dweller who can't have a grill, I still think you're better off cooking your burgers and steaks right on the stove top.</review>

<review id="9322">The overall story of this book was not bad.  It at least gets two stars for having potential.  Edward leaves, Victoria is out to seek revenge, we get introduced to the werewolves, and then there is a confrontation with the volturi.  I thought the werewolves and the volturi were very interesting.  I am excited to see what becomes of the them in the sequals.  I thought the concept of Bella being abandoned by Edward while having a vampire stalking her and having to turn to the werewolves was also a good plot.  The problem was, there was not enough focus on these plots.  They were good ideas, but too much time was spent on other things that were not very interesting and were actually kind of annoying.  Too much of the plot focused on Bella's depression, her relationship with Jacob, and building motorcyles.The one thing that really bothered me throughout this book was Bella, and it kind of makes me question where her character is going.  The reason I gave this book two stars was because most of it focused on Bella's mundane thoughts about losing Edward and having an empty life.  It was downright depressing and dull at times.  Some of the other plots, like the werewolevs and the volturi were good, but overall there was too much focus on Bella's depression.  Her character absolutely drove me nuts in this book.  When I read Twilight, I read it knowing that there were sequals, so I could deal with her weak character because I thought it was a set up for future character growth.  However, I saw no character growth in Bella in this book.  In Twilight, I thought she came across as somewhat needy, clingy, and obsessive over Edward, but like I said before, I could deal with it because I thought the author was just setting her up to grow as a character in the sequals.  A huge portion of this book focused on how empty and pathetic Bella became without Edward.  She basically died and became a zombie, and it was horrible to have to read about her psychotic auditory hallucinations and the pain she was constantly in.  So much time is spent on Bella trying to get herself into trouble so she could hear Edward, and that just bothered me.  I wish Bella would have showed some character growth and maybe would have started to build a new life.  But no.  She just keeps hanging onto Edward, even though she doesn't think he is ever coming back.  Pathetic.It was also clearly obvious that she was only using Jacob to take her mind off of Edward.  This is why her relationship with Jacob annoyed me.  Where is the author going with this?  It's very obvious that Jacob has romantic interest in Bella, but she does not feel the same and obviously never will (Edward came back, so I know there is no way Bella is going to give him up).  So what was the point of building it up and putting so much focus on them?  And she also became almost needy and obsessive over Jacob too! How pathetic is she?  Does she always need someone to cling to in order to feel like a whole person and feel happy?  There was no need for Bella to become so pathetic in this book.  This is just my opinion, but I like to read about characters who develop and make progress.  Bella is just as clingy and needy as she was in Twilight.  I hope this changes in the future novels, because I almost could not stand to listen to her whining anymore.  By the end of the book, I was relieved that Edward came back just so I didn't have to hear Bella talk about the pain anymore.  Blah.  Please, Bella, grow up and get a life outside of Edward Cullen and Jacob Black.  Get some hobbies for yourself, and stop constantly thinking about them.  I realize that Meyer may not have intended to make Bella a role model of any kind, but I will not be able to listen to her point of view anymore if her thoughts are going to be so whiny and obsessive.  It's just not the kind of character, or story, I am intersted in or can relate to.</review>

<review id="9325">This review is from: Australia (DVD)      Think about dialogue in the average David Mamet or Aaron Sorkin (West Wing) show.  It's witty, intelligent, psychologically realistic.  Then consider the opposite. This movie is the opposite.  Here's a typical scene: "Do you have kids?"/"No"/"You'd make a great father"/"Do you have kids"/"No, I can't."/"That's too bad; you'd make a great mother." All the while with camera shots hanging on meaningless meaningful glances and a music score that seems to know that it has to compensate for wholly unemotional dialogue.   And the plot isn't much better: it's a patchwork of predictable twists (He thought she was dead! but surprise! she's alive -- cue the music, again).  If you must watch it at least turn the volume down and just enjoy the pretty Australian vistas and either the still-hot-after-all-these-years Kidman or the shirtless Jackman, depending on your proclivities.</review>

<review id="9327">Eclipse, for those not yet acquainted with the teen romance saga, is the third instalment in the Twilight series centred around Bella, a human girl, and her relationships with Edward, the unearthly beautiful and gifted vampire who is also the love of her life, and Jacob, brooding rebel and recently turned werewolf who comforts Bella when Edward abandons her.  At the end of Book Two (New Moon) it transpires that Edward left Bella in an attempt to protect her from himself and his vampire family, but later returned, re-uniting the pair.  Jacob, by now deeply in love with Bella despite her assertion of being "just friends", is left vengeful and broken-hearted by the idea that Bella wishes to become a vampire herself.The series already boasts an impressively large fanbase and the release of Eclipse was anticipated with feverish excitement - comparisons were even being made, in hushed tones, to the famed Harry Potter.It is with some surprise, then, that the reception of above-mentioned tome can only be described as lukewarm. Even previously loyal fans have expressed disappointment.  One ponders the question: What went wrong?Whilst Stephenie Meyer is certainly no Jane Austen, her writing style bears testimony to a literary background and is fueled by a rich imagination; I don't believe this is what let her down.Part of the answer lies in the comparison thrust, perhaps unfairly, upon the shoulders of Bella and her beaus, with the Boy Who Lived.  Unlike JK Rowling's creations, the inhabitants of Forks, Washington, have not matured or evolved in any noticeable way. Bella appears to have regressed, if anything at all.  Much of the narrative is dedicated to her internal struggles, becoming frankly tiresome at times. Her ambivalence to the idea of marriage, her uncertainty regarding the trade of her mortal life for the undead, fretting over Jacob's hurt feelings and the resulting downward spiral of guilt and self-loathing entirely overshadows the thinly veiled suspense plot, which hardly deserves a mention.  For all her introspection, she appears no wiser.  Her actions remain rash, her behaviour petulant and her judgement poor.Edward, formerly darkly dangerous beneath his gentlemanly veneer, always torn between his love for Bella and his vampiric nature, seems to have been stripped of all depth.  Apart from his ever-expressive eyebrows, he shows hardly any emotion or passion.  As for his issues regarding physical intimacy: he and Bella have always maintained a chaste relationship, made necessary by the obvious risks to her.  This was beautifully symbolic in its own right and needed nothing more.  Sadly, in Eclipse this has been cast aside.  Following what can only be described as foreplay, Edward refuses to take her virtue on grounds of his moral beliefs.  The scene could have been taken from a sex education video.  Furthermore, his preoccupation with her safety and meek acceptance of her "love" for Jacob portrays him more as a father figure than a boyfriend.As for the werewolf man-boy Jacob, he is a likeable enough supporting character, who has added an interesting dimension to the tale, but has outgrown his place like an unruly ficus.  Here, I believe, lies the answer as to What Went Wrong: the unexpected success of Twilight, forcing Meyer to push the story further than she first intended.  If we are honest, we must admit that boy-meets-girl-love-forever-after cannot support a series of three, let alone four volumes.  So the skewed love triangle is inserted, after the fact and so obviously not part of the original plan, like bunny ears pinned to a cat.  A lost cause, then?  This will be determined by the fourth and, hopefully, last book in the series.  Breaking Dawn is due for release next year. Perhaps Bella will surprise us with some powers of her own, be they supernatural or not, and earn her spot on centre-stage.  Perhaps Edward will return to his former smouldering glory, causing us to forgive everything else.I am ever the optimist.</review>

<review id="9328">I am a new mother who was really not sure what type of diapers to use for my son. These were the ones the used in the hospital so we bought them. Then other people bought us diapers as well Huggies and some other Pampers styles. I began to use them and saw that they weren't nearly as good. The swaddlers keep my little guy comfy and dry. I found that the other ones leaked when he was both wet or dirty, the swaddlers don't. Also I like that they have sizes and in between sizes as well for your growing baby. I definitely recommend these to others.</review>

<review id="9331">I purchased the Feliway Comfort Zone plug-in, because my 6 month old kitten has not stopped biting since we adopted her 2 months ago.  She is biting my husband, my dog and myself. It has been so bad that my husband had to go to emergency from an infection he received from one of her "pit bull-like" bites.  This was recommended by someone at the SPCA and, having tried everything else, we decided to give it a try.  It was very disappointing.  After a week of having it plugged in, there was no change in our kitten's behavior and the unit leaked oil all around the electrical outlet!  Fearing that this may cause a fire, we discarded it immediately.  That was almost $40 thrown away and we still have a mean little kitty in the house.</review>

<review id="9335">I remember watching this movie when I was a kid.  As a kid I didnt really know what to think of it, other than it was weird.  As an adult I look back on this movie and...LAUGH!  It is right up there with all the other ridiculous 80s movies like the Friday 13th series.  This movie is at or near the top of the worst movies of all time lists on several sites Ive been to, including MSN.  Heres the story:  Howard the duck who lives on a faraway planet gets to earth by way of a dimensoinal gate created by a new scientific experiment gone awry and he must find a way to get back to earth before evil cosmic emperors use the same gate to get into earth.  Its not possible to come up with a plot any worse than that.  And I can't believe they are actually releasing this movie on DVD.  As if having to wallow thru another 80s slasher flick nowadays (Freddy VS Jason) wasnt enough.This movie destroyed careers and is symbolic of many rididcoulus 80s films.  Don't buy it.</review>

<review id="9337">I purchased "two" Solvit PupSTEPs. Both arrived very quickly. However, both boxes were damaged. Though seemingly intact. One was assembled immediatly put to use. Our 108 year old (dog years)dog loves it.The second was assembled two weeks later for our vacation home. This unit was found to be missing the packet of padding for the steps and  non-skid feet for the unit. Because we were anxious to put it to use, we cut and fitted "peel-and-stick" floor carpet squares to the unit. It works, but the factory pads fit and look much better.I like the units and only wish that a "five" step unit (higher!!) was available.</review>

<review id="9338">After using MS 2007 for several weeks I can't tell you how frustrating it is to use and how much I hate it EVERY DAY I use it -- particularly MS Word -- and the Outlook Calendar is a step backwards and less than satisfactory as it often sticks on the wrong week. I am in an academic setting where a few of us have a trial of this and I think our faculty campus wide will be livid once they are forced to switch - so many here hardly even know how to use email. If you remember the mob scene in Young Frankenstein with an angry mob carrying torches banging on the castle doors I predict that is how our faculty will react.  Also - I've heard our students complaining about the new docx format not transferring to their home computers and they don't plan to switch or upgrade to MS 2007 at home as they've heard such bad things about 2007 and worse about Vista.  There is a download to deal with this but they are still very frustrated.</review>

This does not seem fair to me.I have not used this product yet.  But we have used Turbo tax for several years and have been happy with it.</review>

<review id="9340">Microsoft has a problem. Their celebrated Office programs have been around a while, and every so often a new version comes out. But once a program has been around a while and fully meets the requirements of that particular type of program (word processor, etc), there is little room for natural development and evolution. And this is Microsoft's problem. How can they get users to continue buying their software if the basic fundamental aspects of the program have remained largely unchanged for a while? They they need, the Microsoft brains decided, was something radically new. And thus Office 2007 was born. The interface is indeed radically new - I feel like I am using a new program despite the fact that I have heavily used most of the Office programs since 1996. It is so new that simple tasks like track changes and small cap font turn into an Easter Egg hunt that wastes my time. The ribbon is unnecessarily large and useless. The ribbon is touted to bring to the fore all the commonly needed commands for the user - in actuality, I hardly use any of them, leaving 75% of the ribbon as wasted space. And it wastes LOTS of space - it's huge. As of yet, I have not found a way to customize every part of the ribbon so it displays what I want - perhaps you cannot. There are a host of other concerns, but one that struck me just before writing this review is that the new .docx file format is compressed with the zip formula that makes the resulting file 75% smaller. Now... why do we need that? In this day of 500 gigabyte hardrives, a 250K file isn't going to make me much happier than a 1000K file. Moreover, with high speed internet, the time savings of emailing such a file are rated in the seconds... again, nothing to write home about. BUT... what happens to a compressed .docx file when a part of it becomes corrupted? With an uncompressed .doc file, any program can view the contents and extract any information you can. Once you cram the data down with a compression formula, a damaged file is gone. Toast. Most likely irrecoverable. And that's the risk we now bear because Microsoft thought us, the user, would like saving a few K of file space on our huge hard drives. So, my conclusion is that not only are the UI changes in this version of Office unnecessarily radical, other features like the .docx format are pointless, but pose a significant threat of data loss should a part of the file become corrupted. So for me, I'm uninstalling this and putting Office 2003 back on.</review>

<review id="9341">After I installed the router the DNS lookup kept timing out when I was trying access the internet.  I was connected but the DNS lookup is slow and intermittent.

<review id="9342">The HJ-720ITC is a nice pedometer.  It's compact, yet not too small and not too big.  I like that it has a clock on it.  As a matter of fact, this has now replaced my cell phone as my "pocket watch".  I bought the HJ-720ITC because you can connect it to your PC and download your data and keep track of your daily steps, etc.  You can also create charts and print out this data, or create PDF's for archiving.  The holster is a bit of a problem.  It doesn't stay in place on my belt.  I believe the clip is way too small (or I'm just too fat).  However, it has a lanyard that you can connect to it and clip that somewhere just in case the pedometer comes out of the holster or the holster comes off your belt.  Also, there is no reset button for the steps or calories burned.  There is a reset pin button on the back of the unit, but that just resets the time, it does not reset the data (steps, calories).  I find that disturbing because as I am testing this unit out, I was seeing that the steps are very inaccurate.  I found that it was very inaccurate because I placed the pedometer in my pants pocket.  The instructions state that this is okay and you could even place it in your shirt pocket.  After experimenting with it in the pocket, I found the reading to be totally unacceptable, so I put the holster back on my belt and tried it that way.  The reading was more acceptable now, but that totally eliminates the use of placing it in my pocket.  So... since the readings are WAY OFF because I had it in my pocket (I was getting readings of upwards of 22 steps when I had in fact walked and counted 15 steps), there is no way to reset these total steps for the day.  The pedometer has a built in reset at midnight; the pedometer will go back to zero, but in the meantime, I have to go with incorrect data.** Ok, this pedometer resets every day at midnight.  So...I manually set  the clock to 11:59p and waited until 12:00a so the data can reset.  The steps went to 0 and the data (for the day) was reset, however, the pedometer is now on day 2 of recording the steps and calories burned.  When I took the pedometer out of the holster and attached the USB cable, the thing registered 7 steps.  7 steps from removing it from the holster and connecting the cable?!  That's insane and it totally screws up my total steps for the day and the data on the PC software that was keeping track.  It would have been nice if there was a reset button and a button to start and stop the counting - like the feature on a stop watch.  I weigh 320+ lbs right now.  I'm trying to lose weight.  I joined 24 Hour Fitness.  I've been going every night for the last 3 weeks and got a personal trainer.  I dropped about 13 lbs since then. I'm also doing my Weight Watcher points, and changed my way of eating.  This pedometer only goes up to 300lbs.  I find the weight limitation offensive and discriminating.  I would think that the people at Omron would consider that obese people would like to buy this product.  24 Hour Fitness has a body fat counting device made by Omron.  That device allows input of over 300lbs, so why not this pedometer?  Thankfully I only have 20 or so pounds to go until I reach the MAXIMUM setting for this pedometer.  In the meantime, the reading for calories burned will be inaccurate.  I feel bad for people that weigh more than me.  Pro:Compact sizeEasy to use and setupNice software and PC interfaceLooks really niceCon:Maximum weight to enter in pedometer is 300lbs.No way to reset steps taken.  Just taking the pedometer off the clip and plugging in the USB cable registered 7 steps!!!The holster is very flimsy and will come off your belt.  It's also too small for the belt.The black plastic housing is easily scratched from the plastic holster.My advice would be to buy a pedometer that is less expensive.  While I was waiting for the HJ-720ITC to arrive, I opened a inexpensive pedometer I bought at a discount store that I was going to give to a co-worker as a preset and that thing worked great.  For $4.99 it was no frills; it only had 2 buttons - one for stride and one to reset the distance.  That pedometer did not disappoint me like the HJ-720ITC.</review>

<review id="9343">I just got my new Aluminum MacBook last night, and it's going right back for refund this morning. The LCD is far inferior to my 1st generation MacBook display, and it's actually one of the worst displays I've seen on a modern notebook computer. I've been an Apple owner since I bought an SE/30, but Apple has screwed up badly here, and I find the new MacBook nearly unusable. (Please note, my current MacBook has a glossy screen; that level of glossiness is not the issue here.)UPDATE: I just got back from the Apple Store (refund accomplished), and one of the staff at the store (a photographer) helped me compare my old MacBook with this new Aluminum MacBook and the new MacBook Pro. All of the new MacBooks on display had the same issues: blacks not really black, colors less vibrant, and overall contrast lower than the old MacBook. The new MacBook Pro, however, does not have these issues (although the screen is still a bit more blue than the old MacBook; not as blue as new MacBook). The Apple Store staffer agreed that the new MacBook screen is not great. He also much preferred the old one (or the new MacBook Pro). An online review at gizmodo dot com (gizmodo.com/5063492/macbook-and-macbook-pro-dual-review) clearly shows the same problems that I describe here.The issues:1. The whole screen has an icky blue cast, and nothing in the display calibration settings will fix this (I tried for over an hour). My old MacBook has a much more pure and natural looking white. I think Apple needs to work more on the LED back-lighting for the new MacBook (or maybe they cheaped out on the MacBook LEDs).2. The blacks on the new display are washed out (this used to be a problem with LCD televisions and can still occur with cheap LCDs). This is obvious on the start-up animation (with the multi-lingual "welcome" messages against the Leopard nebulae in space). It's not just an issue with solid black images, however: this propagates to everything looking less crisp. And it's not an issue of adjusting brightness or screen angle. In fact, if you try to adjust the screen angle to get some reasonably good blacks, you get parts of the screen where you have a metallic or posterized effect. I saw this in the store displays as well, but I didn't realize that it would occur under normal viewing angles vs. extreme situations. This is also clearly shown in the gizmodo review referenced above.3. Colors are not vibrant (nothing compared to my 1st generation MacBook). By not vibrant, I mean that different hues of blue, for example, are not distinct from one another. When I open Word, the splash screen has four different blue colors in the "feather" shape at the top right. On the old MacBook the blues are distinctly different and colorful, on the new MacBook they are much closer in hue and more dull. I think this is a result primarily of issues one and two above, but it may also have to do with other aspects of the inferior LCD on the Aluminum MacBook.4. The new MacBook screen should be called "mirrored" not "glossy". My 1st generation MacBook has a glossy screen. It's good. I rarely have an issue with visible reflections from it. The new MacBook is a constant battle. One major problem is that the screen needs to be pushed farther back to get reasonable contrast, but this angle directly reflects ceiling lights at the user. It's also so significantly more reflective than the previous glossy screen that it picks up windows and floor lamps and everything else a lot more easily. It's a mess.I hope this helps other folks avoid my mistake in seeking to upgrade from an existing MacBook. The new one does not feel any faster in day to day use (3D rendering excepted), and it has crippling issues with the display. I would strongly encourage anyone with a current MacBook to take it to the store with you and check out the Aluminum MacBook display for yourself before buying.</review>

<review id="9344">This product does not remember its settings.  My home has relatively frequent power failures (about 6X per year) and every time my power goes out, this gadget forgets its settings.  Each time I need to re-set the settings, Linksys and I have to work on it for at least 1.5 hours and sometimes up to 3 hours.  The first hour I spend with low-level tech support who can only tell me to turn the model and router off and on again or re-set them, which we repeat about 20 times.  After an hour of this, they finally turn me over to higher-level support who usually can help me get it going again (but not always - they also like to blame my internet provider but the problem always lies with the router).It's pretty common for their tech support to disconnect me rather than admit failure.  Then I have to start the whole process over again.Over time, I have gotten very familiar with the Linksys set-up screens, and figured out something myself that I WISH their tech support had told me years ago:  In the Administration-Configuration Management tab, you can save your configuration file.  SO I tried saving the file once I got it working again.  Now I have started re-setting my router by opening this file from the Admin-Config Management tab, and it works like a dream - but nobody at Linksys thought to tell me about this!</review>

<review id="9346">Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)      The biggest difficulty in evaluating security products is that one has to judge based on what *doesn't* happen to one's computer.  Ok, so, I haven't had any viruses or anything of the sort since I installed Norton 360.  But then, I rarely got any before that either.The first thing I noticed about N360 is how SLOW it is -- it took 22 minutes for the software to load.  The settings pages were so slow to take effect that I had assumed the action was complete, and tried to do other things before getting a pop-up about them.Since then, my computer is operating noticeably slower than before -- so badly so that I'm seriously considering uninstalling N360.  I consider it to be troublesome and annoying at best, bordering on unacceptable.  Is it better to have the security that I can only assume N360 is providing, and a computer that is slowed to remind me of my old Pentium 75 MHz on a dial-up, or to have no security software running?  I'm not sure.Other than that, the suite of products & protection in N360 *seems* to be quite complete and thorough -- but again, how does one know that for sure?  Have I been protected from anything?  I don't know.  Unless I knew that my computer was significantly more vulnerable than most, this is not a product that I would buy and use.</review>

However, after about 10 uses, it did not froth the milk any more.  I was very disappointed!!  There was not any reason as to why it stopped 'frothing'.  It was not damaged in any way.  I returned it. I would not recommend it at all.</review>

<review id="9350">This is just another "me too" story.  When I read these review, I was thinking that they were a fluke, or that there was some kind of mistake.  There isn't a mistake.  The company, essentially, produced many discs which were faulty, causing the program to crash during installation.The company response has been infuriating, and absolutely pathetic.  I won't even go into the details.  Just be warned.</review>

<review id="9351">I am a HUGE fan of the books...I've read the entire series twice. I was quite excited for the movie, I was impressed with most the cast (Rob for Edward...he sure looked the part I thought)...but then I saw the first trailer and had to wonder...why are they in the middle of a forest when Bella confesses to Edward she knows his secret?However, that isn't the biggest issue I have. Minor change...most movie adaptations from books have them. My problem isn't that these vampires aren't like Dracula or don't have fangs...I believe any author can write a vampire how they see fit. My problem is the lack of total passion between Bella and Edward in the film. The book has your heart racing over the pure love they feel for each other. It's there, and no one mistakes it. In the film...I couldn't tell they loved each other at all! Part of the problem I think is Bella's total lack of emotion the entire film. Bella is "an open book" to just about everyone but Edward in the novels...but most the time I could barely tell how she was feeling in the movie. I rate it 2 stars because I believe that this book was perfect for film adaptation and failed in some of the most important areas. However, it didn't fail as much as Eragon's adaptation, so I'm not giving it 1 star. I hope New Moon is better...but with that rushed time frame they're giving it, I'm not getting my hopes up.</review>

<review id="9352">I am glad for the sizes but the construction is poor and the bristles too stiff to do a good job cleaning.  I still have to break out the pipe cleaners for the small spots and the rag for the large.  The bristles don't bush out at the end so when you push the brush into the well, you are scraping the metal end against the bottom - the metal end doesn't do a great job scrubbing the residue off the bottom of the well. Bamboo makes a Kong cleaner with a suction cup that is better designed and has a small brush in the handle.  You'll still need the pipe cleaner for the smaller pieces though.</review>

<review id="9353">Word remains incompatible with Spaces. The window jumps randomly from desktop to desktop and hides behind other windows. Word is terribly slow to open. The suite is missing a Onenote type functionality, which was addressed partially by a "notetaking view" in Word which (theoretically) incorporates some onenote-type functionality. Unfortunately, it does not work. Anything in the notetaking view has constant glitches: formatting disappearing and reappearing, crashes...it is terrible. Entourage is similarly terrible. I switched over from Mail to Entourage, and it (by default) erased all the historical messages I had stored in my Imap account by changing the time left on server before deleting setting...without my input. I didn't even know the settings were changed until I went to look for an old message and it was gone.I had high hopes for fixes for these items in the patch: no joy. STAY AWAY! They by mistake sent me an extra upgrade copy...it is so bad I refuse to sell it or even give it away. The only good news: Vista on OSX in a Fusion virtual window with office 2007 runs better than on any of the 3 PC's I tried to run Vista on (thats why I switched back to Mac, Vista drove me insane...but it runs great on a MacBook Pro for some reason). Good luck.</review>

<review id="9355">I was one of the fortunate people who did not have problems with installation of the software. As noted by the other reviewers who were able to get software to work, this speech recognition far exceeds that of previous voice-recognition programs for the Mac.  The biggest drawback to this program is that it does not have the ability to learn words that are not in its dictionary. This is problematic for professionals such as physicians and lawyers who use technical language that is not in the software dictionary. The other posts suggest that this functionality will come with future releases. At the present time, the absence of this function is a significant limitation for anyone who requires technical terms for their writing. That said, it is extremely accurate for non-technical dictating. In addition, the software is quirky.  My current problem is that it occasionally deletes, copies, and pastes words or sentences, and I have no idea where these came from or why the program is doing this. The program is a useful piece of software but does not totally replace the need for a keyboard. Presumably the program will work better in the future as updates are released. The purpose of this review is to indicate that the software does work for me, which apparently has not been the case for many purchasers. For this reason, it gets two stars. However the software clearly has limitations, the most significant of which is the inability to learn new words. In addition, it is quirky. I can recommend it with these caveats.</review>

<review id="9357">My main complaint about this controller is that when a key is pushed to move my player, regardless of direction, it will continue to drift after the key has been released and will only stop after another key is depressed.

<review id="9358">The fans who stuck by this series, regardless of age, will be dissatisfied with this product. I still love Stephenie Meyer's first three in this saga, yet the fourth seemed to be written by someone who did not care for the established story. I loved Bella's vulnerability and naivet? Edward's love, maturity, SENSIBILITY; Jacobs playfulness, loyalty and his love as well. The traits I fell in love with were almost forgotten. Edward gave into Bella's irrational wants and the rest of the book hung on his indecisions. Sure, fans got what they wanted in every way possible. I agree with other fans: cop out. All of the tragic novels mentioned in the previous books (Romeo and Juliet for example) should have been a compass to what love stories inevitably are: tragic. There was a line that talked about how it was strange when puzzle pieces finally fit together for Bella, they were all about to come undone. That is real. This book? Not so much.Petition for rewrite? Sorry Stephenie Meyer seems like you missed the mark for a lot of people on this one. I refuse to believe this is what you have been dying for your fans to read.</review>

<review id="9361">So, I reviewed this book earlier and gave it three stars.  I deleted that review and am now giving it two.  The more I think about it, the more I realize how disappointed I am with it and that I was just trying to convice myself to like it.  I'm giving it two stars rather than one b/c there were some parts that I did like- when Bella first becomes a vampire, the wedding, and the epilogue where Edward finally gets to see her thoughts.  SM really did change her characters but not in a way that caused them to "grow."  In fact, most of them became one dimensional- including Jacob and Edward.  I think she lost the focus of the love between Bella and Edward, which has been the core of this series, to focus on the mother- daughter relationship.  It felt like Edward, who is my favorite character, got lost in the back half of the story.  Why weren't there any father-daughter moments?  He was just there as the tool to explain what others were thinking.  Try again, Stephanie Meyer, try again.  Until then, I'll just stick with Twilight.</review>

<review id="9362">Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)      I really wanted to like this camera, but found that I couldn't.The first problem that I had with it was the "ergonomic grip" on the camera. It's fine for just holding the camera, and would work well for video shooting. I just found the buttons to be hard to use for still photos when trying to use it with one hand. The camera never felt comfortable in my had when trying to rotate my thumb up to hit the photo or video button. When it comes to using the D-ring and the center button, they felt fine.The next major issue I had was with the image stabilization for photos. According the the manual the image stabilization won't be used under the following conditions.1. Setting the flash mode to forced flash2. Setting the shooting mode to the sequential shots mode3. Setting flicker reduction to "ON"4. Setting the scene select function to the night view portrait, fireworks, or lamp mode.What I found is if you set the flash to any mode other than "OFF" the image stabilization automatically turns off. Then you have to deal with the crazy menu system to turn it back on. There's no easy way that I could find to have it temporarily shut off for the above situations then automatically turn back on. Given that I was concerned about camera movement while rotating my thumb up to the button on one handed use, image stabilization seems really important.I also didn't like the confusing menu system on the camera. By default the menu system is in "normal mode" and then there's a "simple mode" that you can select. That all sounds find in theory. The only thing is I expect every function to be adjustable in the normal mode, and then basic functions to be available in the simple mode. That somewhat seemed to be the case, but it wasn't clear what some of the options really were in simple mode. For example to adjust the video recording in the normal menu it give you a lot of different TV options and a couple of different web options. How do those relate to the selection of recording size in the simple menu? Maybe I just didn't find the answer in the manual, but I don't think that was the case.As far as the water proof, it's really limited to 5 feet of depth. Not something that will be useful if you go scuba diving, but maybe will be ok for light snorkeling. I think for the most part it's just a gimmick to lure people into buying an inferior product.I really can't comment on the actual photo or video quality. Because I got so frustrated with the menu system, the image stabilization, and how awkward it seemed to use; I never bothered transferring the data to my computer to check it out.All in all, I would say avoid this camera and see what else is out there.</review>

<review id="9365">Truly, I am disappointed with this series! The books are way better! HBO has done a disservice to this wonderful series. Blood Ties on Lifetime back in 2006 was ten times - no, a hundred times better than True Blood. I have ordered HBO specifically so I could watch True Blood. I was willing to give this series a chance, but by Episode three, it became evident to me that all there was to this series was soft porn! I mean, the brother is a HO, a tru MANBO, he is a slut and a self invovled moron, which you can kind of laugh at his exploits, I mean its obvious what he is. But then suddenly everyone, everywhere in the series was getting it on. They took a wonderful imaginative idea and turned it in to a Porn Flick. And way too much bad language. Every word is a cuss word, I swear it. The only redeeming qualities in this show is that has amazing music in the background, very moving music, from modern rock to violins that make you breathless and turn a moment into a truly moving one. So the music gets ten points but this show only gets a 2 outof 10! That's right! This show sucks, big time! Sucks with big pointy teethe and porno!</review>

<review id="9366">This IPOD looks really cool, I actually like the cover flow, and the colors are awesome. However, I had mine for 3 days and it has already broken. It doesn't charge on any of the old accessories, which makes this 8 gb for $149.99 not seem like such a great deal (if you are going to have to get a new stereo system and car charger). I also thought that the "Genius" would be a really cool feature, too bad that none of my songs are available through the "Genius." PSH, what a crock.   If I get my new one and it doesn't break, I will rate higher, but I thought Apple was so far above any of the other MP3 players that I wouldn't have to worry about something so stupid. They just don't make 'em like they used to!</review>

<review id="9367">When I first got this toaster as a wedding gift I was ecstatic, I love breakfast sandwiches and this was a great way to make them at home for way less.  Unfortunately, less than a year after we started using it, the egg poacher stopped working and it started making a weird buzzing noise.  Then within a month of the egg poacher dying, the toaster part gave out too.  Now keep in mind I used the toaster part almost every day, but the toaster that I had before this one, which thankfully I had kept, in case my step-son needed one for his apartment, and am back to using now gets used just as often, and I've used for almost 3 years.</review>

<review id="9369">The Flip video recorder is simple enough to use.  And it took great looking video with good audio quality.  What turned me off was my experience with the software.Upon reading the instructions (yes, I did RTFM) I was instructed to download the updated software.  To my surprise and portending what was to come, the software overwrote the entire flip software application on the Flip device.  The software application runs on the Flip device.  It allows you to view the videos and save the videos to your computer.  I think the software is entirely unnecessary and in my case... broken.Although I could view all the videos using the flip software, I could only save about half of the videos to my computer.  I think the videos are MP4?  The "save process" attempts to convert the videos to AVI.  What Flip should have done, is allow me to save the videos directly to my computer as MP4.  And provide an MP4 viewer software and a conversion software to AVI.What made the software really painful -- was that when it failed during the middle of a conversion -- it took down my whole computer.  Windows process got stuck.  I was also worried that it might corrupt the Flip device.  Fortunately, it did not.  My understanding is that for all USB commercial devices, Windows XP SP2 (?) disabled write caching -- which minimizes the chances of corrupting a USB drive -- when one disconnects the USB drive without performing the Safely Remove Hardware wizard.  I'm not so certain about the Flip device.  I did see that Flip has issued a critical software update.  Flip also offered that I send them the device and they would fix any issues.</review>

<review id="9370">I bought one of these to replace an SMC7004AWBR which stopped allowing admin logins and wouldn't reset to factory defaults.It installed like a dream, was really easy to set up, and worked fine--at first. Unfortunately, I work from home as a software engineer and system admin, and really need a reliable router--and this isn't it. Once I open too many simultaneous TCP connections, it'll crash--the lights blink as if it's still working, but it stops actually routing packets.I've tried a firmware upgrade, I've tried changing the MTU size, and next I think I'm going to try another brand of router...  If you use BitTorrent, RSS aggregators, or other software that opens lots of TCP connections, avoid this router. Similarly, if you have several computers in simultaneous use, this device will only frustrate you.</review>

<review id="9371">The IPOD NANO 4th GENERATION will not charge on previous charging devices such as car charges, docking stations, speaker components, etc.  Apple requires the owner to purchase their own charging system and it is very unclear if there is a charger available for the car.

<review id="9372">I needed a portable 500GB USB drive and decided (based on reviews here) that this new Seagate FreeAgent Go drive was worth the extra cost/GB because of the superior Seagate brand reputation and small form factor. I also looked at the iOmega and Western Digital drives that were physically larger if not half the cost per GB but seemed to have reliability issues. I also use the Seagate Barracuda ES 1TB drives in my NAS and other Seagate drives in my desktops and they have performed flawlessly for years.Unfortunately the FreeAgent Go drive was just about DOA... I would hear the drive spin-up, Windows would recognize the drive, assign a drive letter, then... nothing! on further investigation I discovered that the drive had a RAW file structure. Over the next two days I tried to get an answer from Seagate, scoured message boards and tried the software tools from the Seagate website and other vendors for a fix on how to format the drive. Unfortunately the more I read, the more I realized that this is not an isolated problem with this drive or something that seemingly can be fixed by typical methods (or at least I couldn't find the solution before I got frustrated that I was spending so much time trying to fix what should have worked out of the box). Also, there was no documentation in the package, except for a diagram that basically said plug the drive into the wall, plug in the USB cable and some sort of software should auto-run. I returned the drive to Amazon (which was actually an easy and pleasant process) and ended up buying the iOmega Prestige 1TB drive a little bigger, but I got 1TB for the same cost as the 500GB Seagate and it works as advertised so far. I am very disappointed that Seagate, a premium hardware manufacturer, doesn't have their QA process working better (or is outsourcing manufacturing to unreliable vendors). I depend on hardware reliability combined with RAID redundancy to protect my personal and business data, and this is simply not what I expect from a market leader.</review>

<review id="9373">It seems like, in the wake of HEROES' huge first season success, Tim Kring and his staff looked back at those episodes and then completely misinterpreted what the audience had liked about them.  As the second season started lots of new characters were introduced, all of them uninteresting and poorly cast.  Characters from the first season remained frozen in their storylines, going nowhere.  The first season's famous cliffhanger endings were gone.  There were a few hints of the former glory, but not many.  In fact, the writers' strike may have been a blessing for HEROES.  This disastrous season was truncated and Kring & Co. have had the time to reflect on the mistakes that were made.  Maybe they'll get back on track for Season Three.  If you need to own this boxed set of Season Two just in order to keep your collection complete then wait a few months and get it cheaper on Ebay. It's certainly not worth $40!</review>

<review id="9374">*SPOILERS*Given all the publicity around BD, I had extremely low expectations before reading this book.  I think I am being generous with 2 stars, my actually rating is 1 1/2.  I thought I hated New Moon but BD makes New Moon look like classic literature.  I mean, come on...Renesmee?!!! Too many episodes of Sesame Street when SM chose that name?? I wasn't too fond of the name "Bella Swan" either.  I hope Meyer wasn't as careless when she named her own kids. And geez, Bella is a sex-crazed whore?!! Sex is her only bargaining chip to prolong her humanity.  Then there's Jacob imprinting...o------kay, I'm still getting used to that idea, it's just creepy.  And gosh, this book had so much teenage angst I'm surprised I wasn't tempted to do something meaninglessly destructive like I dunno, shave my head or slit a wrist.  It was like watching a CW marathon that never ends.  There's just too many problems to list.  The only parts I enjoyed reading were the honeymoon and the Bella/Edward hunt where I felt the original chemistry between the two.  Please, Stephanie! Finish Midnight Sun to redeem the series!</review>

<review id="9375">I've been baking bread in a machine 2-3 times a week for the past 4 years. After the pan in my Sunbeam failed, I decided to treat myself to the Zojirushi. What a disaster! I exchanged the first one I bought for another because one end of every loaf was burnt even on the light setting. The second machine also browned unevenly -- on the medium setting one end on top was brown and the other white. The crust on the botton and sides was thick and tough. To make matters worse, the bread tasted bland! Even when I departed from the recipes in the Zojirushi manual and tried some of my own tried and true successes, the bread tasted bland in comparison to what I had been making in my Sunbeam. My husband and I couldn't figure it out because the ingredients were the same. I returned my Zo for store credit and bought another Sunbeam (from Amazon). It is the cheapest machine on the market, and the bread comes out great. Positives about the Zo: quiet, pan and kneading blades feel solid. I really didn't want to write a bad review, but our Zojirushi experience was terrible.</review>

<review id="9376">The camera itself seemed to work fine, but the software to go with it is terrible.  After spending 6 hours with customer support and 2 cameras later, it was determined that the software does not work on AMD Turion processors.  I've seen many reviews with similar problems on different computers.  If you have an intel pentium then you shouldn't have a problem, but I wouldn't recommend this camera if you have anything else.</review>

<review id="9377">The device didn't work on any of the dogs I tried to quiet. The distance from the dogs ranged from 25 feet to right up close and personal, and they just kept barking! However, I was able to return it to Amazon for a refund. Happy about that, as this particular device was not cheap.</review>

<review id="9378">Like another reviewer, I tried using the WD tool to change the drive to Raid 1 and it would never finish. I even left it running overnight. I ended up returning it and keeping my Drobo. When I called tech support, they said it could take 6 hours.. well after 12 or more hours, I gave up.</review>

<review id="9379">I've just switched to the Mac and was lured with Intuit's false representations about how simple this would be.  The program is miserable.  The "customer service" that allegedly helps users switch from one platform to another is positively sadistic -- it took me countless hours on the phone (often repeating the same information to a third or fourth allegedly helpful person) and over a month to get data that Intuit said would work on the Mac.   I've now spent at least three full days trying to turn the data into something really usable -- and realizing that the Mac program lacks many of the relatively simple features that I'd come to expect from Quicken.   This is quite a way to lose customers.</review>

<review id="9380">This review is from: Wall-E (Three-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)      I saw this movie in the theatre and LOVED it!  I thought it was brilliant.  I couldn't wait for it to come out on dvd.  The day of its release I went to Wal-Mart and purchased the special edition as I really wanted the digital copy for my iPod and computer.  I get home, insert the digital copy into my computer, only to realize there is no authorization code.  I take it back to wal-mart and exchange it.  The lady opens it there and again, no code.  She explains that 10 other people have been in complaining about no codes and how none of the copies seem to have them.  She says I should call disney as they can't be opening every dvd.  I get home and get on the phone with Disney "customer support".  What it boils down to is they admitted it was their fault.  The girl offers me a sincere apology.  So I figure, great the problem will be rectified.  Nope.  Instead what I am sent via email is a process where by I, the paying customer, must now jump through hoops to get a copy of this code.  I have to print out a form, fill it out, go make copies of my receipt and my proof of purchase and then either scan it, fax it or mail them the forms.  After Disney receives it, they will mail me a code and I should get it in the mail (7-10 business days later).  O_o  Now, while it may not seem to be too much hassle to scan and copy and print; there is no reason why I should have to do ANYTHING after I spent my money and Disney clearly admitted fault.  Forgive me if I missed the whole concept of customer service, but shouldn't it be Disney who should be jumping through hoops to rectify the wrong?  I paid extra money to have the product when I purchased it; not to take have to do some legging around and then wait almost 2 weeks later.  My advice; if you really want the digital copy buy the regular version for $15 and then hop on iTunes and download Wall-E there.  You'll spend about the same amount of money and you'll save yourself a whole lot of time and aggravation.  I hate to give this product a low score as I think this is one of the best movies of all time with a terrific story and great message.  But Disney screwed up big time with their customer service on this one.  Way to not provide for your customers and then treat them like pirating criminals when they want what they should have had at purchase.  It's perplexing.  How can people successfully run a business this way?</review>

<review id="9381">I have had this 7-port hub for a couple of months now and am using it with an iMac. Its performance has been erratic. I had all my peripherals plugged to it - printer, camera, keyboard-mouse and my iPod sync cable. It worked fine for a couple of weeks. Then the keyboard-mouse started failing to detect on startup. Unplugging and replugging would solve the problem but it was not worth the trouble for every time. Then the iPod refused to sync through the hub. So now I am back to using the ports on my computer.So I'm not happy with the product. Either I got a bad piece or Mac users should stay away from this USB Hub.I'm unhappy because I was a believer in D-Link. I have a D-Link wireless router that has been working flawlessly for over 2 years now. Follow Up: I contacted customer service and they sent me a replacement that has been working well since..... so I guess I just had a bad part.. nothing to do with computer compatibility.</review>

<review id="9382">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      What a disapointment!!! I absolutely adored Twilight, but i had to wrestle my way through New Moon! It started out strong, but started going down hill as soon as edward, the bipolar vampire, left Bella, the drab and dull spoiled brat. stephenie meyer had a chance for some real character development by having bella overcome her dependance on edward, but no, the little development bella made was quickly vanquashed by the return of her beloved vampire. bella is absolutey pathetic. her entire  being is based on some guy!!! besides spending all of eternity with edward, she has no ambitions, dreams, or even slightly inteligent ideas!! im 13 and i have to say, thats not a message i enjoyed recieving. all and all, a horrid book with an even worst message. honestly, bella is the worst role model a teenage girl could ever have!! she should just give up on this whole mythological creatures riff and marry mike newton. at least that would be a bit of a surprise!!!</review>

<review id="9383">I bought a case of Luv's for my 6-month old. I can't wait to get rid of them because I find the strong chemical/baby powder scent very unpleasant. My baby (still breast-fed for the most part) has been fighting diaper rash since I started using Luv's. Her rash clears up when I let her "air out" between changes or use more expensive brands. Thankfully, I only have a few more of these diapers left. I'm not buying this brand again.</review>

<review id="9384">I was excited to get this espresso machine after reading the reviews. Sadly it didn't deliver. For 2 weeks I cleaned, soaked, cleaned, brewed, cleaned, soaked, brewed but every time the coffee tasted funky, like a chemical taste. It was so bad that I would use my other cheaper coffee maker to make my morning espresso and make another batch to test this one again. The problem was that the filter holder was made of plastic and the water tank was made of plastic. No matter how hard I tried I could not rid it of that plastic smell or taste. My other espresso maker has an all steel filter holder and a steel water tank. It is a nice idea having a removable water tank for easy cleaning & filling but just putting your nose to the top of it you could smell the plastic chemicals. I wasted I don't know how much coffee, both ground and pods trying to work it in figuring after a couple of days it would be fine but after 2 weeks of doing this daily I gave up and sent it back. I even soaked the filter holder in a pot of coffee overnight to see if it would cut the chemical newness out but to no avail. The chemical sour taste overwhelmed the coffee everytime. I will be sure to find my next espresso maker that is not all plastic. Also, I was disappointed that all of the pictures show 2 coffee cups but they are not included.</review>

<review id="9385">I purchased this item in search of a thermal coffee maker that not only keeps the coffee hot, but actually brews coffee at the correct temperature to produce flavorful coffee that is not bitter. The Zo is unable to do so, because the brew temp is barely 180 degrees. A coffee maker must brew above 194 to really hit the sweet spot and produce great coffee. Also as soon as it arrived I ran water through it to test brew temp. Unfortunately it stopped brewing and shut off at the 2 cup mark leaving water left in the water tank. Not a good sign. The body of the unit is really cheap and flimsy and smells of very strong plastic. I am going to try my luck with another brand. On the plus side the water stayed hot in the carafe for hours. So basically your buying a cheap coffee maker with a good carafe. It is a shame they could not produce a machine as perfect as their carafe. So if you could care less about what the coffee tastes like and just want it hot this is the maker for you.</review>

<review id="9386">I bought this machine because of its Best Buy rating in Consumer Reports.  All I can figure is that CR got some sort of perfect specimen.  The first machine I received had a problem with the clock -- it would keep minutes fine, but the hours went all over the place.  I set it up in the evening, reset it in the morning (after it didn't start brewing at the time I had programmed), and it was off again by the time I got home.Since I drink coffee every day, I figured I'd use the coffeemaker until the replacement arrived.  That came a couple days later...and the lid was broken.  Needless to say, I'm not asking for another replacement.I'm pretty disappointed in this machine because the coffee brewing aspects seem to work well.  The carafe is well-designed and hasn't dripped, and the machine is easy to set up, use, and clean.  Hopefully B&D will fix the electronics and plastics problems someday.</review>

<review id="9387">I bought this Sharp because it was available to replace its burnt-out predecessor from Bed & Bath immediately, and it had to 1) fit into my custom-kitchen space, and 2) match my stainless and black appliances. It does both, but unfortunately, after 3 weeks of operation (and not happy with its clumsy features) the window and LED display began clouding up. I am now bringing it back and getting a  Panasonic Genius NN-H765BF, which is a bit larger and has more features.</review>

<review id="9388">I bought this model to use for work after the great experience my husband had with an earlier version of one of these. What a mistake. Of all the models I could have bought, I bought the one that has a horrible hard drive, making it so slow it's almost completely useless. This model has a known issue with the SSD hard drive--Asus admits it--that slows down performance TREMENDOUSLY compared to previous models. I'm not talking about a little lag here and there. I can deal with that. No, this is like 2 - 3 minute wait time to open anything, install anything, do anything. Believe me when I say it's just awful. The only thing that fixes it is installing a new SSD, which starts at $70. Considering I barely had the cash for this machine at all, this was disappointing to learn to say the least. I am hoping to sell this somehow and get the 1002HA...though thanks to this experience I am definitely a bit hesitant.</review>

<review id="9389">This would be ok for traveling to check email or to act as a cache for pictures, but it is a little slow and clunky for anything else.  It has a habit of notifying you that it is downloading updates and then shutting down in the middle of what you're doing.  Vista business does not come with any of the rudimentary games that come with xp and so you can't play freecell or solitaire while waiting for a connection.  This little computer is a bit of a disappointment.</review>

<review id="9392">I don't know what Apple is doing these days. They go on and on about how great the new one-piece machined 'unibody' construction is on these new Macbooks, but then they go and mess up on some really important basics.1) No Firewire- Hey, this is an APPLE technology. They created it, and supported it for years. Lots of people used it, lots of people loved it. Now, all of a sudden, it's GONE from the Macbook line, except for one old plastic model that isn't going to be around much longer. Why? So if you need it, you can go shell out $2000 for a Macbook Pro? Just not a great way to treat your customers, particularly long-time ones.2) Trackpad issues - Hey, the new trackpad is bigger and all-glass. Cool. There's no button anymore, the trackpad *is* the button now. Cool, I guess. Some of these new trackpads don't always work right... they don't always register clicks, the cursor sometimes moves with a life of its own, making it very hard to select menu items, and other bits o' random weirdness. Not cool.Apple says they're going to fix it soon with a software or firmware update. I sure hope so. Because if they can't and it's actually a physical/hardware issue to any significant extent, then we're talking either a massive notebook recall (very inconvenient for affected users), or Apple basically nicely telling us "it's not that bad"/suck it. If the latter, you could be stuck with a way-less-than-optimal trackpad, if Apple were to deem this problem not grounds for a return/replacement. Well, depending on how the inevitable consumer lawsuits would shake out, of course. But that would take awhile.So again, if you're one of the ones who got a glitchy trackpad, best hope the upcoming update fixes it. I have some faith in Apple that it will, at least mostly.3) El cheapo screen- The Macbook screen is, to put it nicely, not great. Now, the *backlighting* is good, much brighter than the old Macbooks. But the screen itself? SUPER-glossy. Apple likes this because it makes the colors 'pop' a bit more, but the price for this is that you get TONS of very distracting, annoying reflections (you can use it as a makeup mirror) and oodles of very noticeable smudges, smears, and fingerprints. Also not a fan of the big, space-gobbling black bezel. It increases the footprint while making the small (aka 'barely adequate') 13.3" screen look even smaller. Check out the previous gen Macbook Pro to see what an appropriately-sized bezel looks like.  More importantly though, the viewing angle on the Macbook screen is TINY. Images can look good if your head is positioned PERFECTLY, but move just a bit right or left, or (especially) up or down, and the image goes to heck. If you think that that's 'just the way LCDs are', compare the Macbook screen to the screen on the MB Pro or even Macbook Air-- neither of those is nearly as 'touchy' in terms of viewing angle as the MB's is, and have much larger 'sweet spots'. Another bit of Macbook screen wackness is that you have to tilt the screen WAAAY back, almost to horizontal, or blacks will appear washed out. But do that, and you catch ALL the reflections, in glorious super-glossy detail, from any and all overhead lighting. Darned if you do, darned if you don't.Bottom line, the MacBook uses a cheap screen made to seem higher-quality than it really is by super-glossy glass and a very bright backlight. Clever, but not cool. Apple doesn't seem to have really thought through the drawbacks here. Or perhaps they did but didn't care, since they were saving so much $$$ on the screen.4) Speakers - If you love music (and who doesn't?) you're gonna be disappointed here. These are some pretty muddy-sounding and quite volume-limited built-in speakers, even by notebook standards. And no, not everyone digs using headphones all the time, or lugging add-on speakers everywhere. The whole idea of a notebook is easy, all-in-one portability."Well, whaddya expect for $1300?!", some might say, inadvertently revealing just how out-of-touch some of us Mac fans can be. Alls I can say is, my friend's ancient (and lots cheaper) iBook sounds better. This is the company that gave us the iPod? Is music a priority or not?5) No card reader, and no internal 3G option - Disappointing, and annoying. Apple's way too in love with minimalism. Enough said.6) Specs - Not great, particularly for the money... little 'bump' over the previous gen. At least the graphics chip is significantly improved, though that was a low bar to pass (the previous gen's Intel integrated graphics were very weak).7) Price - $1300 is a lot for a notebook, especially with the economy heading south.  Apple won't give you any options at all for a 15" screen or expansion slots even in the high-end part of the Macbook line, which is pretty obnoxious already (again, they want you to cough up the $2000 for the MB Pro). But to ask these prices AND not offer those things AND take away Firewire AND cheap out on the screen (among some other things)?? Wow. Guess all the money went into the unibody construction.Which makes sense- even Apple has said that the unibody process will be very expensive at first, with its cost dropping over time. If you're acquainted with the previous generation Macbook, you can sort of understand Apple's obsession with the unibody, as the most serious complaints with the previous gen (plastic) MBs were in the areas of poor build-quality and questionable durability. Apple's trying hard to fix that, to their credit. Well that, and I think it strongly appeals to Steve Jobs' well-known aesthetic sensibilities.Jobs (whose health I hope improves) is fairly obsessed with his products having a Jaguar/Mercedes Benz-like 'high end' look and feel.  While that sure *sounds* cool, it isn't, always. Not when it, plus the build-quality mistakes made with the previous gen, cause Apple to focus obsessively-compulsively on a couple of areas while messing up/cheaping out in so many others. For $1300, the consumer/prosumer rightly expects a great *all-around* notebook. If you look past the surface, this isn't it.On a more hopeful note, with unibody costs dropping, the NEXT Macbook revision may have the budget for a better screen and other improvements, perhaps even better pricing too (yeah I know, good luck). *That* MB could be the great all-arounder so many are looking/hoping for. But even if that comes to pass, the Macbook line will still retain at least one serious flaw going forward, as it's highly doubtful that Apple will reverse its very poor decision to dump Firewire. That's a choice which will continue to screw the hobbyist/video-audio enthusiast crowd, a group that was particularly Mac-loyal (though maybe not as much anymore).Despite the Macbook's drawbacks, don't get me wrong- the new MBs have their strengths: nice looks, should be quite durable, improved graphics card, the included i-Apps are useful and intuitive (as always), OS X is more secure than Windows, et cetera et cetera.  But, it's just not a good value for the money, particularly considering the minuses.Apple really, REALLY needs to listen to its customers more. I'm sure they *think* they're listening, but something's off there, as the result -this product- doesn't really seem to reflect that, at least not in any balanced way. Lately, it's like they've been building things more to please themselves, and not us. Normally I love Apple, but I'd think long and hard before buying this one.</review>

<review id="9395">I bought this for my collie along with 5 other toys. He loves just about everything, but won't touch this.  As another reviewer mentioned, it has a very strong plastic smell that is overpowering.  Even with the treats in it it smells like plastic.  Then, after a few days the treats began to turn rancid and really stink.  There is no way to get the treats out or clean it. I tried everything short of drilling a hole in it. I do not see how anyone could give this anything more than a three. This was a waste of money.</review>

<review id="9400">This was, I repeat was, the best controller I had used.  Sadly it lacks durablility.  First it developed a downward drift.  Then it had interfacing problems that required me to disconnect and reconect it numerous times while starting and exiting the game I was trying to play so that the throttle would work properly, it wouldn't go in reverse.  Lastly, which made the controller unplayable, the downward drift exceeds the upward pull, so you can pull it all the way back and still be looking at your boots.  Overall I liked the controller but it just doesn't stand up to long usage, not abusage.</review>

<review id="9404">A friend of mine was watching Opera and they were talking about "the Secret" is a book by Rhonda Byrne. She convinced me to read it. It basically teaches people to think positive and good things will happen. My problem with the book is two things. First it tries to teach that thought waves are projected out into the universe and attract similar thoughts (explained by Quantum Physics??) But the second teaching is the one that makes my go hum.... They explain the process it all in a way that, if good things don't happen to you, is because you don't "believe they will". How destructive this could be... There is a psychological/sociological concept called "blaming the victim" in which we blame the very individual who has been hurt. This is the process used by an abuser ("If you behaved the way I want you to, I wouldn't have to hurt you!"), and it destroys confidence, self-esteem, hope...The medical profession has its own version...There is some belief that we are the cause of our own illnesses. (Most especially, cancer). What a horrible burden to place on someone if they become ill! Likewise, if you wish for something to happen (without a true understanding of what, in life, you can control and cannot) and it doesn't come about (winning the lottery, for example), then the blame falls on you...("Well, you just didn't believe enough!") Can you see what the implications of this nonsense are? They have an answer for everything. They talked about the people who die in war and how it was because they had the "thought" of war that drew them to their death. I can even begin to say how much damage this will cause. These are the basic RADICAL principles of people who do not believe in medicine and there child dies because of a simple cold, they blame the child for not "believing enough".</review>

<review id="9406">These bars are delicious because they have the saturated fat and sugar content of a candy bar. Sure they have 20g of protein, but they also have 20g of sugar. These bars have 270 Calories, with 8g fat (5g saturated) and 30g carbohydrates (20g sugar). Compare that to a Snickers with 271 Calories, 13g fat (5 saturated) and 34g carbohydrates (28g sugar). Also, instead of whey protein (derived from milk) most of the protein in this bar comes from soy, which has some undesirable toxins, like dehydroalanines, nitrosamines, and furan.

<review id="9407">I ordered this router because of the high rating it received. I've had nothing but trouble with it. It was a miracle if I could get online first thing in the morning, & even if I could, it was only a matter of minutes before I got kicked offline, & I had to repeatedly plug & unplug (for 30 seconds each time) the router to get maybe another 5-10 minutes of online time.I used their online chat tech support, & downloaded firmware, reset the router, & nothing worked. So they had me send back the router & they sent me a new one.Same problems started immediately. I've had it.I thought Linksys would be a really good router because of Cisco's reputation. I was wrong. I've bought a Belkin N-Router instead & am hoping it works better.</review>

<review id="9410">:Warning spoilers below: As an avid read I can honestly say that I loved the first three twilight books. So when the release date came up for Breaking Dawn, I decided that I would go and get the book. I have read the whole book and can honestly say that I am no longer a fan of the series. I have no clue what happened to Stephanie Meyers writing style between the Eclipse and Breaking Dawn, but obviously it was something horrible. I respected her for adding into her books elements of sorrow and sacrifice showing everyone that the world isn't always wonderful like so many books try to make it now a day. Apparently though that has changed, because in this book Bella didn't give up anything. Everything in the story came out to a happy ending, she didn't have to give up Jake or her human family, she didn't spend her first years as a vampire in complete misery, and lets face it, Edward didn't even have to make the choice of whether to change her or not. When it came down to it, it was either she dies or is changed. It wasn't much of a choice. So on top of him not undergoing the anguish of making that decision he also didn't have to listen to her wither in agony for the first few days of her new life, which I think deeply weakened the story line. Also in this book it seemed to me that Bella's tone was changed she was no longer the in depth super discripitive person we have come to know and love. In this book it seemed to me that her parts were rather cold and distant with no real feeling in them.  This was not because she had turned vampire.So overall I was not impressed with this book, everything was too perfect, all the loose ends were too neatly tied up, there was no major discussions, no heartache, and everything turned out peachy. I think that this was a major cop out, I mean after all the fuss Jacob made about Bella becoming a vampire I was really hoping that at least he would have objected, and him imprinting on the baby was just messed up. Also Bella new super powers, ick I mean honestly did she need anything more special about her? Also I really disliked her getting pregnant, it  went against the rules she set up and should not have been possible.  It also made her transition way to easy there was nothing she gave up nothing she.  A bouncing baby, an adoring husband , a cottage in the woods, she lives forever, Jake doesn't hate her.So all in all this cheery everything good happens here twilight book was definitely a disappointment to fans everywhere.</review>

<review id="9412">I bought the ooma system at the beginning of February thinking it would be great to ditch comcast digital voice. I went ahead and started the porting process and that is where my frustration has kicked in. It appears that after almost an entire month, they have not even started the porting process. I have emailed support 3 times in the last month and got one response from support: "They are really backed up (porting). Email us back next week". Another words, they have no idea if the port process was even initiated. Gee thanks! Customer service for ooma is a black hole, totally frustrating. Can't see how this company is going to stay in business with non-existent customer support.I am returning my ooma back to Amazon and I instituted a charge back on my Amex for the premier service. Buyer beware!</review>

<review id="9413">I couldn't decide whether to buy this trimmer or the similar Panasonic ER415, so I bought both of them. The ER415 is very much better. The actual trimming performance seems to be nearly identical--both of them trim just fine for me (I'm not looking for a close shave inside my nostrils), but the "light" on this one is completely useless except as a battery drain. I assumed the light would be located inside the tip where it would actually shine where you're getting ready to trim, but it doesn't. The light is located down on the side of the trimmer, so the only way it could even potentially be useful is if you pointed the light into your nose and then somehow managed to aim the trimmer where you'd pointed the light. It's a very stupid design and a completely useless feature, but there's no way to turn it off, so the light is on and draining the battery the whole time you're trimming.The cap on this one is just a tiny clear plastic cup that fits right onto the metal cutting head with nothing to hold it in place, so if you keep the trimmer in a drawer with other stuff as I do you'll be constantly fishing for the cap. The ER415 has a big cap that covers the whole end of the trimmer and clicks firmly in place. The ER415 is a much better design and much less of a battery hog.</review>

<review id="9418">I tried basic white bread recipe(4 cups flour and 1-1/2 cups water) which came with the machine about 10 times with little ingredients adjustments every time. It came out a very heavy thick loaf every time. I called a customer service and was told to cut bread flour a half and follow the recipe for the rests. I tried it, wasted all my time, and all the ingredients. Then I tried a recipe(3 cups flour and 1-1/4 cups water) of the "Panasonic" bread maker and could get a soft light loaf finally. Zojirushi's recipe is totally useless as well as the uneducated customer service. I don't believe this happens only to me. 4 cups flour and 1-1/2 cups water makes very dry dough obviously. I don't know why the other reviews were so good and Zojirushi didn't correct the recipe. This machine may be good as long as you don't follow their recommended recipe. Past 7 weeks our family ate very thick heavy toast every morning. I won't buy Zojirushi products any more.</review>

<review id="9421">I suppose I made my first mistake purchasing a MyBook Pro about 7 months ago, and then purchasing this model a few weeks ago.They both died on me, giving me a high-pitched squeal and the infamous 'click' sound. Luckily they are both still under warranty, so I will send them in to Western Digital and get new ones as replacements, but they will only be used as secondary drives. I've learned my lesson and will be sticking with LaCie's drives from now on.The only plus I can give this drive is the FireWire 800, which is very fast and very few drives feature it (the LaCie does, however), and its very stylish design.Avoid this one, get a LaCie drive instead.</review>

<review id="9422">This review is from: Gone with the Wind (VHS Tape)      I can't believe the American Film Institute would even dare mention this film in the same sentence as The Godfather, Casablanca, or Citizen Kane, which are all superior films. This movie was just plain and simple BORING.  I give it 2 stars because of the costumes and production design. It held my  attention for maybe the first hour but then just dragged off. And I don't  have a short attention span if that's what you're thinking, which I'm sure  fans of this movie who are reading this review are. I don't see the  difference between this and any other one of those sappy romantic movies  where they constantly soften the lens when focusing on the leading lady's  face. Casablanca is a much better movie and is a helluva lot more romantic.  All Scarlett does in this movie is complain, complain, complain. If I were  Clark Gable, I would have laughed when she fell down the steps. The worst  part is that the lousy twists in this movie go on for nearly 4 hours. Ugh.  I should have rented this one first before I bought it. I'm still kicking  myself. I suggest you don't make the same mistake I did and at least wait  for it to come on TV first.</review>

I bought a WD "500" before this, and half the time it is dead as a doornail, and then occasionally it'll snap back to life. Let's just say I don't trust it. I wouldn't buy one again -- both drives are going back to Costco.</review>

<review id="9425">Latest updater, as of 3/18/8 still has problems with MacOS.Bought three for a party.One recorded great and crashed both my Mac and theFlip Video when download attempted.One produced 3 out of 9 videos which were corrupt andhang both Mac and Flip Video when download attempted.One seems to work so far.Also a really weird effect is there is no way to unplugthe Flip Video while working/uploading local videos. Inother words, if you save videos to your computer, thenstart uploading to YouTube unmounts of the Flip Videodevice fail. So there is no way to save videos, pop outone Flip Video to use again, then pop another one in tounload videos. In other words, you can only use one ofthese cameras at once very simply.The other option to parallel processing is to click throughthe Flip Video USB device -> DCIM -> 100Video then drag allthe videos to your computer, then unmount the Flip Videodevice and begin native uploads directly from YouTube ratherthan use the Flip Video software.</review>

<review id="9426">I'm so disappointed to be writing a negative review about this book. I absolutely loved the first 3 books.Then came Breaking Dawn.I was ready to love it like I loved the previous 3 books - to not be able to put it down and stay up late reading it.  It ended up being a struggle for me to wade through this nonsense to finish it.  First of all, we lost the essence of our favorite characters.  For some reason, Edward changed into a doormat, catering to Bella's every whim.  He's no longer witty, sarcastic or even endearing.  In this book, he basically serves as Bella's servant, sitting idly by and doing whatever she asks him to.  Meyer doesn't even really focus on him at all.  We also lost Alice.  Formerly Bella's best friend, Alice takes a backseat in this book the same way Edward does.  She doesn't have opinions on anything and doesn't seem to care about Edward or Bella for most of the book, until she reemerges at the end.  Charlie changes from a caring father into a "don't ask, don't tell" bystander.  And what about Esme?  It was as if she barely there despite the fact her daughter ran away, her daughter-in-law was dying and evil forces were after her granddaughter.  She was always portrayed as extremely maternal, but she faded into the shadows at just the time the family matriach should be in the forefront.Meyer created wonderful characters in the previous books and had a responsibility to do them justice.  Meyer conveniently bends storylines throughout the book to reach the happy ending at the end of the book.  Suddenly some newborn vampires are perfectly composed?  Suddenly the Cullens can easily handle being around human blood (Bella gets a paper cut in the second book and everyone goes nuts.  Now she drinks it out of a cup and everyone is fine).  Suddenly the werewolves are shape shifters, which Edward apparently knew the whole time (even though he referred to them as werewolves in previous books) but decided not tell anyone, saying "It never came up".  What?!  Bella conveniently not only has no problems at all as a newborn vampire, but also has the most powerful gift imaginable.  Charlie doesn't ever questions Bella's mysterious "illness" or ask any questions about why she suddenly looks different and has a different voice, along with a 3 month old that has the intelligence of a 3 year old (which could be it's own issue in itself!)  And while there was no sex in any of the previous books, Edward even mentioning he wasn't sure that vampires had any ("I suppose" he says in the first book when Bella asks him if vampire marriages are like other marriages sexually), suddenly vampires are sex crazed, with Emmett even bragging that he and Rosalie have broken houses in passion.  It just doesn't add up.I understand everyone has a different idea of a happy ending for this saga, and that the author can't make everyone happy, but I didn't think she would leave me feeling so disappointed.  I feel like she did a disservice to her readers and the wonderful characters she created.</review>

<review id="9429">I loved my Cuisinart coffee maker so much that over the next year I bought 2 more for other locations.  The second one had the self cleaning light start blinking after the first pot of coffee was made and nothing could make it stop-the coffee seemed fine though.  Four months after the original was purchased, it started having difficulty finishing the brew cycle...it produced, alot of steam and gurgling and only about 3/4's of the water I began with actually made it through the grinds. I tried cleaning it and it went downhill from this point. I thought that this was peculiar to this machine only, but alas, the same thing happened to the third machine.  I'm now looking for a more reliable coffee maker.I own numerous Cuisinart products, but will not be buying another coffee maker from them.</review>

<review id="9431">I've just upgraded to Quicken 2009.  What a disappointment!  This version runs really slowly.  The interface is changed, so it's difficult to find your way around.

<review id="9432">The concept is great. My cats love flowing water. BUT do not waste your money on THIS product. LOUD AND BADLY DESIGNED. I actually like the sound of running water far better than a constantly humming motor. People that reviewed this product and said the motor is quiet either have TV on constantly or have small noisy children running around to mask the CONSTANT humm.I agree that you have to take it apart to clean the motor from pet hair and that a nylon stocking helps eliminate that problem. However, what the other reiewers forget to tell you is that it takes about 15 to 20 minutes to put the product back together again each time, due to poor product design. The pump has to line up with a rigid plastic hole while you hold the rigid plastic gate in place and keep the rigid plastic cord keeper from falling off. If you manage to get all those pieces lined up, then there is still all the plastic nipples that have to go in the plastic holes to hold the top in place. It is a nightmare of poor product design! Why should I have to put a nylon sock over something to make it work when I purchased it because it says it works??? It also says the motor is quiet. It is not, even with a sock.If people actually like this product for convinience over its faults it is because we, as Americans,are too used to wasting our money on poor producuts and bad designs then throwing them away and purchasing more. Do not waste your money on this product.</review>

<review id="9439">I came late to the beautiful Twilight party. A couple months ago I pick up the books and couldn't put it down. I reread all three books over and over again. Standing in line Friday night I was so excited. Then after everything was said and done I didn't know what to think. This was not the beloved, extremely passionate books I loved. This was a really bad fanfic written by a 14 year old girl that wanted everyone to live happily ever after. I wanted Bella to sacrifice something, anything, but instead everything is easy for her. I wanted Jacob to get closure, instead he got a unrealistic cop out that SM specifically said couldn't happen. I have been bragging about these books for months and my mom wants to start reading them. I know that I will tell people just to stop after Eclipse and let your imagination finish.</review>

<review id="9440">I am so glad I wasn't the only one who thought this book was less than great. I really feel that this book was aimed for more of a "adult" audience that a teenage one.Bella's character was not at all excited about anything, and hearing her describe the wedding kind of gave me a less than excited feeling. Then she gets pregnant....which is very obvious from what is described, the reader figures it out before Bella does. Then she becomes all maternal and responsible? Give me a break!Edward didn't really seem like the Edward in the previous books. The characters Bella, Jacob, and Edward all semmed so unbelievabley immature that it sort of ruined the book for me. Also, I hope I'm not the only one found it weird that the author wouldn't describe the honeymoon scenes, but went all out ( and if I may say so, a bit overboard) with the description of Bella's pregnancy? I found some of the descriptions to be utterly digusting and most certainly not something I would advise a teen or pre-teen to read.This was a disappointment.</review>

<review id="9441">This show seems to have some weird (vampiric gaze?) over viewers that misleads them into thinking it is a great show.  It could have been so much more, but being rooted in the bad source material  is it's greatest foil, I'd have to say.  Some of the acting, including the star, is below what I'd expect from a show with a budget this large.  As a regular HBO subscriber I was looking forward to this show; only to be bored by episode three at the inane plot and meaningless direction of many of the characters and the MTV/slasher/rockstar depiction of some of the 'bad' vampires.    A far better choice would have been to use the extremely superior Ann Rice series or Fevre Dream for a vampire setting; True Blood truly stinks.HBO, oh how the mighty have fallen. The Wire: gone. Deadwood: Gone. The Sopranos: Fuhgetaboutit.  Hopefully they'll redeem themselves with The Pacific later this year and with A Song of Ice and Fire in the future.</review>

<review id="9442">This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)      I liked the first book in the series (Twilight) and as soon as I finished it I went out and bought New Moon. It was immensely disappointing. Bella is incredibly boring, apathetic and acts like a brat through the entire book. The Jacob Black plot was SO obvious, no person with half an iota of intelligence would have taken as long as Bella to figure out. I just wanted to get to the end so it would be over, not because I much cared what happened to her or Edward. Can't say I like a character that spends an entire novel moping and takes a guy back the first chance she gets even though he treated her like dirt (for her own good, of course...so stupid). I won't bother wasting my money on the third book. I may get it from the library. Just how many books are supposed to be in this "Saga"? I do hope Meyer has planned and plotted a solid storyline for future books with a good beginning, middle and end. This one was clearly a mess with horrible pacing, repetitive writing and no plot.</review>

<review id="9444">For those who complains about paying for their childrens' return, they can still use the Federal Free version for their kids. Most kids will only need a 1040EZ, so I don't think this is much of a problem. The larger problem is for married filing separately and for those who do their parent's return as they are seniors. The ten dollars per additional return does hurt. I do understand how people are upset. However, if we went to the tax preparer individually, we would have to pay each tax preparation individually. I don't have problems with paying per user. What I have a problem with is the price increase on top of the pay per user costs. I felt Intuit should have lowered the cost in order to charge per addtional return or raise the price and left it with first 5 free. However, with the double charge of increase price and additonal per return charge, I feel they are pricing themselves out of the market. Of course, for those who trust turbotax, they will begrudgingly pay the extras, for others, its important to go to the competitor. Update 12/31/08:Since Turbo tax changed their fee structure, I decided to stay with Turbotax and I even upgraded to the Premier version. Thanks Intuit.</review>

<review id="9445">Not a bad little portable to tote along.  As long as you understand that is what you are buying, you will probably be reasonably happy.  In retrospect I would have preferred something with less Linuxiness.  My desktop and portables are about what I do with them external to the device itself.  But for Linux, the medium and message are too often the same thing.  Any sort of Linux problem will lead you into a fairyland in which the solutions, many possible and varied, are apt to lead you farther and farther from home.The keyboard isn't impossible, but it's got a little stinker.  If you touch type that shift key on the right side is going to take some serious re-learning.  And every time you miss it, you get to clean up your mistakes before you continue with what you are doing.  The size works well even with my clubby hands.I'd buy it again for half the price.  Maybe.Update: three weeks on.  I would never, never, NEVER buy this again.  The Linuxware is buggy beyond anything I've ever used.  Frequent crashes of one thing or another.  At the moment there are problems with the touchpad.  I'm zero interested in all the why and how and cleverness of Linux and 100 percent interested in a product that works.  This product doesn't work.  What I wanted was a product with turn-key usefulness.  Not what I got.  Read the other reviews by folks who have had problems.   I've had many of the same.  I wanted a Toyota Tercel; I got a Yugo.  Silly me.Update: five weeks on.  Asus recommended restoring the unit to its original state by powering up and holding down F9.  That restored the touchpad dialog box to sort of usefulness.  A day later trying to use "file properties" in the file browser I discover closes the browser.  The image previewer frequently crashes, and you get to start over.  It's a great little computer with some seriously bad software.  And when you restore the unit, you get to use your time to reinstall all the updates like the Bulgarian keyboard - not kidding.  And reconfigure to your secure home wifi.  Your wifi LAN is secure, isn't it?  It's not by any stretch of the imagination worth the money.Final Update: I use it every day.  But I'm not sure why it's my job to fix or decide not to attempt to fix so many problems with the software that comes with the computer.  For the moment I've modified myself to use what works well and not use those things that work poorly or not at all.  Great for webwork, email. No problems with the wifi.  For what you pay, it needs to work a whole lot better right out of the box.</review>

<review id="9449">I have ATT DSL and did not like that the DSL router provided (2Wire) did not allow me to block sites, limit hours of access, nor easily block or allow certain nonstandard ports.  ATT has all kind of software to do this on your PC, but with my teenagers, I think it should be a feature of the router.  With that said, I purchased this Linksys because it does allow me to do just that.  The setup was easy except it did not work with my DSL until after I went to the Linksys website and read the line that said "in order to work with DSL, set your router IP address to 192.168.2.1"  By default, the installation software kept trying 192.168.1.1  I have no idea why the software couldn't handle this but hey, one setting and everything was working.The logging of web access works, but does not include a reverse DNS lookup so all you see are a bunch of IP addresses; not very helpful.The blocking of sites works as does the limit of hours of operations.Based on everything so far, I liked it and would still be using it except, a few times a day the router would reboot or something.  I'd be using my wireless laptop and all of a sudden, the laptop would show that the signal was gone.  After about 60 seconds the signal would return.  This also happened to PCs that were wired to the router.So, now I have everything wired back up to my ATT DSL router (2Wire) where I do not have the regular loss of signal.</review>

<review id="9450">We purchased the Breville juicer about 3 yrs ago. No we haven't been using it that long. We only got a few months out of it when the juicing basket literally fell apart!

<review id="9451">I just wanted to add some information about this product that should be known by anyone considering purchasing this.First of all, it is important to know that Linksys has changed the WRT54G from earlier versions of the same model.  The latest version of this product model has less RAM and runs a different firmware (essentially an operating system) than previous versions of the same product.  That's right; Linksys completely changed the product, but continued to use the same product model.  Is that even legal?  It shouldn't be in my opinion.  :(This newest version of the product (version 5 or "v5") is what I have, and it's been nothing but trouble.  I bought it after reading dozens of glowing reviews... which turned out to be for the older versions of the same product model.  Linksys has now created a new product model which is identical to the older WRT54G versions (v4 and newer) which received all the 5 star reviews.  This is now called the WRT54GL.  It is identical to the WRT54G v4 and newer.  Again, this should not be legal.  They had a highly regarded product, then took that product model and applied it to an inferior product calling it the same, and then took the old product and gave it a new product model, and started charging more for it.  I'm so disappointed in Linksys.  Linksys is not the premium manufacture which I once thought they were.  In a nutshell, all the 5 star reviews you see here, are for the WRT54GL product model.  Buy that instead.  All the 1 star reviews, are for this product.  Take a look at the older reviews for more evidence of this.</review>

<review id="9452">I bought this because of Seagate's reputation (now shot), long warranty, and sale price.  I've had it for TWO WEEKS and my Mac doesn't recognize it. It won't mount on the desktop anymore even though the System Profiler can see it! What's even worse, the Seagate Diagnostics doesn't see it. Fortunately for me, I only had time to copy some of my desktop files on it, and I didn't erase the originals. I used it over the long period of two whole days. I will be returning this and buying anything else.Oh,yes, it hums happily away just as if it were actually working. It's not. I'm very disappointed that Seagate not only doesn't seem to be backing its products, but that its products are suddenly zero in the quality department, and that they don't seem to give a damn!</review>

<review id="9453">I have been a huge Linksys fan in the past.  But I have had 14 months of intermittent problems from Hell.  Many hours of phone calls to Linksys says all is fine and Comcast says it is the wireless router.  I figured it was my very old owned modem and bought a new one for $80 bucks. Same problem!!!  Disconnected WRT54G and dusted off an old wireless B router and all was great.  With all the phone calls to Linksys,  they wont exchange it (under warranty) until I reconnect it and go through troubleshooting it on the phone yet another time with them. I just spent 30 minutes on the phone with 2 people, on hold once for 10 minutes because the guy was telling me it was a 1 year warranty and I was saying it was 3 years. OH,  NOW he tells me this v5 and the v6 have known issues, never mentioned before.  Just forget it.  My time is worth more than this garbage.</review>

<review id="9454">This item needs to be taken off the market.  My son almost suffocated to death in this.  He kicked his way out of it and the whole thing ended up covering his face with the velcro part.  I had been hearing muffled cries, so I went in to go check on him, and he could barely breathe.  I was so scared!!&^@%&!%&!^#%!&^#%&  DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I repeat- DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!</review>

<review id="9455">OK the design is decent and looks like an economy shaver but maybe it's too cheap for me ($30). I rather spend over $50 on a better quality body grooming shaver. My main problem is the battery power and performance. It uses NiMH battery and it's not replaceable, so you have to throw the whole shaver when the battery is no good. The manual says it's good for a 50 mins run on a full battery but my experience is more like 10 mins, after that, the shaver becomes less powerful and does not cut thick coarse hair very well, I have many moments when the hair got stuck in the shaver, not a pleasant experience. Secondly. the manual recommends to fully discharge the battery before recharging to prolong battery life, so I let the shaver run until it dies with annoying buzzing sound in the background. Thirdly, a full battery will not hold the charge for long when it's not in use, after a few days, the battery loses power, so you have to wait for the 8 hours charging time each you want to shave. I don't know if I have a defective battery or not. I will have to contact Philips. I want a body groomer with more power so it will not get hair stuck while shaving. Philips should have use a more powerful lithium battery or at least exchangeable AA NiMH battery.</review>

<review id="9456">Out of the box this item doesn't work.  All I get is a white screen.  Support from Creative Labs is non-existent.  Let the buyer beware, don't buy this unit.As of June 12, 2008:  Here's an update.  I got so frustrated with the white screen problem that I slammed the unit flat onto my desk.  Low and behold, that fixed it.  Then, the next project was updating the firmware.  After following the directions carefully, I kept getting a firmware problem notice and the unit refused to reboot.  I had to reinstall the firmware TWICE to finally get it to work.  So far, it's holding up.  I've gotten a white screen only once and I was able to use the reset to clear it.  It seems to me that several of these units might have faulty wiring problems.  Very poor quality control.  As of June 13, 2008.  It died.  Doesn't work anymore.  Let the buyer beware.</review>

<review id="9457">Yes, I waited awhile to see this film and am glad I did. A person can be engulfed by hype because of a particular fondness for a charactor. All the ravers of this film are blinded. They idolize the spectacle before them because they want it to succeed. It is true, Batman Begins was a good movie. The Dark Knight does not equal or  match it, and it should.        As I sat through this movie I noticed a strong resemblence to the 1989 film Batman with Michael Keaton. The staged feel of an already fake press, the marauding comic-like villians who fall on cue, the numerous subplots of Gothams crime bosses and alot of long, empty dialogue. Thats not to say theirs absolutely no good parts. Like in Batman 1989 some scenes really did shine. Jack Nicolsons Joker was pretty good with his, "Wait'll they get a load of me" stuff. And I harken back to that 1989 Joker who hung from a high perch and laughed while battling Batman. Was that same depiction in the Dark Knight?                       The Harvey Dent charactor was strained and boring. I couldnt believe how many times his name was uttered. What made it worse was that I could care less about his role. The nail in the coffin was Rachaels replacement. This woman was very unattractive in comparison to Katie Holmes(most guys agree)and drew zero empathy from me. The action scenes dissapointed on most levels. Sure, alot of swishes and booms took place but they were not cohesive. They were only there to fill the explosion quota. A good half of this film could have been removed to kill the dullness factor. I'm all for long substanative words but that element was missing. Scene jumping without relevance was another squasher.   Ledger did put a worthwhile, unique spin on the Joker. I yearned for more of his charm. He did the same thing Nicholson did as it applies to outdoing everyone else. Its hard on a film when a superior actor alone carries it. This again is where it emulated Batman 1989. Ledgers excellent scenes are the only ones worth reviewing on the dvd and if your honest you'll admit it. Who's gonna play back Commissioner Gordons longwinded banter with anyone? Batman Begins had heartfelt quality dialogue that expounded on the personas of each the way a comicbook couldn't. I've seen some write that they have watched the Dark Knight over and over again. Something is wrong there. Only parts of this film can be watched over again and thats it. With all its shame, drudgery and forced hype it can only be left to you the viewer if we really want to continue down the road of regurgitating a 1989 Batman for this franchise. Actually, forget about our control over this. When we hear, "Enter the Riddler" the lines will form again.</review>

<review id="9458">This drive automatically spins down when not being used, and there is no way to disable this feature.  Unfortunately on my computer under Windows, this means that the drive disappears in "My Computer" and the Disk Management tools if I don't use the drive for extended periods of time.  The only way to get the computer to recognize the drive again is to power cycle the drive manually by pushing the power button on the back, it will not automatically "wake up" when I try to use the drive.Western Digital's only recommendation was that I switch to a slower USB/Firewire connection, as their "button manager" software can keep the drive alive.  This feature is not supported on the faster eSATA connection, however.  (If that's the case, why did I pay more for an eSATA-capable drive?) At least the company did do an RMA exchange of my drive, just in case it was a problem with the drive or other components, but the replacement had the same issue too.  This seems to be a "feature".Their tech support also said that numerous customers have had similar issues if they plug the drive into a UPS or power strip.  They recommend plugging the drive directly into a wall socket, but that didn't seem to help me at all.I have another external eSATA drive from another vendor on the same computer (plugged into my UPS, no less), and it doesn't have this issue at all.  I've left it connected for days not using it and the drive doesn't disappear.  So it definitely appears to be an issue with this model of drive.</review>

<review id="9460">I have used this maker several times and on the lowest temperature setting #1 and the waffles are dark in color,crisp and have a slight burned taste. According to the instructions setting #3 is for golden brown waffles, NOT TRUE!  I've been making waffles for years so I know how to operate a waffle maker.  My preference is a softer, light golden brown waffle.  Needless to say this item will be returned.  On the plus side, easy to use, non-stick surface works great!</review>

<review id="9461">I bought my Eee PC about a month ago, and for the first few days I was really happy with it. Then that 'OoooHH! Shiny!" feeling wore off and I started to see the device for what it was. The battery life claims to be about three hours, while in reality it was closer to one hour. I was only word processing as well so I didn't have any other periferals running. The keyboard was small but not small enough to really bother me. It worked well.   In the end though I had to return my Eee PC because the little internal fan that keeps the system cool stopped spinning and there is no way to open the thing up to repair it.  I was not very happy with this model, but if I had the extended battery and the version with windows it would have changed the whole thing. Save your money and get a better version.</review>

<review id="9462">This unit looks nice, and at first the pump was barely audible.  Although my cat wouldn't go near it, I thought in time she would learn.  Then the pump got loud enough that she was afraid to go near her food as well.  There was enough water in the bowl but the pump struggled, and after a few minutes, failed to move the water at all.  I'm not sure of the price of pumps, but I'm not about to buy a new one every 24 hours to keep this fountain running.Reading reviews of comparably priced fountains, it seems that quality is hit or miss -- mine missed.  Take your chances and maybe you'll have better luck.</review>

<review id="9464">Setup was a snap, file copy was adequate and ran a full Norton Ghost backup (about 150G) without a hitch.  Copied the files to the device from a Vista machine, extracted them from an XP machine.There was something that sounded like a little screw rattling around inside the casing.  It arrived that way and I'm going to assume that it didn't shake loose during shipment, but was the result of an inadequate QA process.  I returned it and will probably look for a completely different brand since I don't trust SimpleTech now -- as a company.</review>

<review id="9468">Now, on to watching the incremental progression of the installer module program update bar. At least, those two activities portend a pay-off.  You know your discretionary time has been squandered when the most interesting scene in a movie is a 10 minute segment of competitive dishwasher loading.  Since that interlude was culled from the personal life of the screenwriter (Jenny Lumet) one has to speculate on how far the supposedly creative community has sunk. What we have here is dysfunction melded with stultification, the former exemplified by every member -past, present and potential  - of this Stamford, Connecticut clan: the reluctantly indulgent titular Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt), Kym (Anne Hathaway) the chemically dependent rehab patient sister on a weekend pass, Paul (Bill Irwin) the enabler father, Abby (Debra Winger) the emotionally distant ex-wife and mother, and let's not overlook Carol (Anna Deveare Smith) stepmom and consummate peripheral observer. If that wasn't enough, throw in the groom Sidney (Tunde Adebimpe), who had all the acting range of a guy who knows where the casting director's skeletons are buried and your journey down the highway to personal regret is in fifth gear. The film seemed like an andro inflated homage to multiculturalism. If the director or screenwriter had thought of including a scene or two at the Mohegan Casino, no one would have been left out. But, that may have been interesting and in total contrast to the stupefying pall that permeated the film. Jonathan Demme decided to film with a hand-held camera to give it a video journal feel and he succeeded. If you have ever been held hostage obligated to politely watch a friend's home videos, the scenes of the rehearsal dinner might drive you into flashback epileptic seizures. Why two stars you say? Because the actors were generally competent with the drivel they had to work with.</review>

<review id="9471">I was loving this until it just froze up and wouldn't do anything. I couldn't even power down unless I removed the battery. After troubleshooting with SanDisk support, they advised me to return it. It was just past the 30 day Amazon return policy, so I'm sending it back to SanDisk and they're sending me a new one.They offered to replace it so quickly and based on the message board here, this seems to be a fairly common issue with the m- series. I noticed that the SanDisk support line no longer even mentions the m-series, only c and e. I wonder if they are doing away with the m's.</review>

<review id="9472">They did a few things right with this release. The new increased cell variation limit is one of those and the primary reason for our upgrade(7 systems all XPP SP3). Another welcome feature was threaded performance increases and the ability for several users to be updating a single document at the same time. We also like the new formula editor. However it now takes three extra clicks to do anything like inserting an image or setting a print area and that's after you know where it is. One user with dual monitors has Excel hang the system and crash daily. Performance in Outlook and Word appear to be the same but now with a clumsy user interface. All and all, if you have used office for a few years and 2K3 is working for you don't waste your money but this is still better than the free alternatives.</review>

<review id="9473">I bought two of these planning on using one on my wife's machine and one on mine. She has a Windows 2000 Pro/sp4 system. All of her USB ports work correctly. However, I tried to use the hub and it would connect and seemly work with various devices until it would just hang the computer and force a cold reboot. I tried it with a SanDisk Flash Drive (2 GB and 512MB), Logitec Mouse, and ActiveSycn with her ipaq. Same symptom. I tried various combinations of ports, cables, and hubs. Same result. Plug the device directly into any PC port, it works. Plug the hub into the same port (with and without the A/C adapter) and it would hang up the system forcing a reboot. Never got around to trying it on my system. Returning it to Amazon and will try the Belkin. Wasted several hours on what should have been a plug and go. Others have had much better results. I guess the gremlins were laying in wait for me this time.</review>

<review id="9474">The hardware is impressive, but unfortunately it ships with the U3 virus software. I'm a software engineer by trade, and I'm amazed that Sandisk includes U3. When you insert the USB stick into a new computer for the first time, Windows will pop up a notice saying that's installing the U3 virus. Guess what happens when you give this USB stick to your boss to transfer some files? After he plugs it in, he yells at you, saying he doesn't want any damn software installed on his laptop. Telling him it's the U3 virus doesn't make it any easier. Also, when you plug it into a Windows machine, two drives show up. This is due to the U3 virus trying to do auto-run. I tried to plug the USB stick into a photo kiosk at my local drug store to upload some photos. Because the first drive is empty (out of the two that show up), the photo kiosk will say there is nothing on the stick. Good job there, U3 virus. Finally, I got so sick of the U3 virus, I ran the "uninstall" feature, which presented me with two options. The first option said it would take 99 minutes to complete. The second option said it would delete the U3 partition, which I believed referred to the first partition I mentioned in the above paragraph. I chose this second option, and it deleted everything off my USB stick. Then I had to pay $150 to have my data recovered. Do not tolerate the U3 virus. Delete it immediately, or perhaps get a USB stick from another company.</review>

<review id="9476">I am guessing manufacturing quality on these was really bad and retailers are dumping them cheaply through discount avenues. You are likely to need to get a replacement through Western Digital's warranty program. You can probably argue for free shipping, and will not be out any cost, but the hassle of replacing is just not worth whatever discount you are getting for this drive compared to others.Once you have a drive that works, they seem to be fine.</review>

<review id="9478">To be fair, I thought the first book, Twilight, was fantastic; I thought the second book, New Moon, was building to something equally fantastic, but I read the the third book, Eclipse, and I think the author totally bombed.  It had such a different tone.  It was very much every emotion you can feel and everything scattered everywhere type of story.  A mess, really.  I skipped over a lot of pages.  It also was very soap opera-ish with the whole can't choose between warewolf and vampire thing.  I also thought it very unfair that she kissed...another man/animal?...though she's constantly telling us (on every. single. page) how she can't live without Edward and oh my god Edward, Edward, Edward, Edward...blah.  She can't even be faithful as a human and she wants to spend eternity with a vampire.  Okay.It was rough.  What kept me going was that I was hoping Eclipse would build to something, much as I hoped the second, New Moon, would build to something, but uhm, no, it sure didn't.  It was definitely disappointing.  I was going to read the last book, Breaking Dawn, since I'd already gotten this far and am one of those have to finish something types, but I just cannot muster the effort.  It's totally pointless for me.  To sum up; Twilight: 5 stars.  Very interesting story.  A chick falls for a vampire and he falls for her back - absolutely cool!  New Moon: 4.5 stars because while Edward leaving made the ending of this book that much better at the end when he and Bella reunited, it still sucked that he left in the first place.  And also the Jacob thing bothered me.  She doesn't want you, go away.  Eclipse: 1 star.  I give it for the original story, but the rest sucked.  Breaking Dawn: none for me, thanks :D</review>

The thing won't load downloads, won't access the "help" buttons, won't perform any necessary calculations - in fact, you are required to keep complex numerical formulas written down so that you can "multiply the indexed number from the last page for each quarter by 92.35%" and fill in blanks.

<review id="9484">I followed the step-by-Step installation program, but the installation, however, had a serious outcome with my network--none of my three computers can communicate within the network.  The installation somehow reconfigured my home network (MSHOME) and I can't get it reconfigured.  which defeats the purpose of having a home network.  This is serious.   I contacted Linksys, who stated they only provide help for internet connectivity issues, not networking.  I spoke with two techs who said they couldn't help with networking and that I should contact Microsoft.  Past experience with Linksys was outstanding, but their service this time was poor.The range is only slightly better than my WRT54G Wireless G router.  Don't expect any real improvement over a wireless G connection.  I moved an additional 10 feet and one wall away, and I was out of range.  I bought it to increase range, since my network is all G speed rated.</review>

<review id="9485">The 8gb Zune is so much better than this.  If you have owned a nano within the last 5 years you have already used this IPOD nano anyhow.  Apple changed the design to a short wide model then back to this one with "WOW! round edges"!!  Lets go buy one!  With the functionality and ease of use of an 8GB Zune I would never go back to IPOD, it would be like downgrading an OS from Vista to windows 3.1 in the visual aspect.  Plus the Zune just has more features like WOW I can change the damn background and no stupid round circle click wheel from hell.  Sorry Apple, re-distrobuting an old model and still chargeing the same price is lame.  Zune is better for the money.</review>

<review id="9487">I've had to return two white macbooks so far. Each one came with a defect that was completely unacceptable for a $1,000 laptop. The first one had some keyboard issues. The tab key would feel mushy, like there was a piece of gum under the key. This was especially apparent when I would start up my computer in the morning. This macbook also had a slightly misaligned case. So I returned it got a refund then ordered another white macbook. The second unit had a faulty trackpad. The button on the trackpad was very mushy and it didn't "click" at all. The trackpad button would work very inconsistently especially when clicking on the right side and the left side of the button.  I did some research on it and after a few searches I found out that I had to put a tiny piece of folded paper inside the battery compartment to fix it. After I did this it worked fine but I wasn't about to pay a good amount of money on a defective macbook. So now I'm waiting on my replacement macbook that should arrive in the next few days. I'm crossing my fingers on this one.</review>

<review id="9490">I've had three of these Linksys WRT54G Wireless Routers. Why three? Well, with each one, they work absolutely fantastic...for about 2 months and then seem to become, for a lack of better word, "stymied". It's almost as thought they can only process data for awhile then stop. Obviously I'm not a computer expert, but I've contacted Linksys technical support several dozen times (not kidding - I've written them all down). So, they have sent me two replacment routers. I know the router is the problem because if I connect my computer directly to my cable modem, it works fine. With the Linksys router, it just stops connecting from time to time randomly. I have a Linksys WIRED router from the past, and it works just fine - and always, so I thought the wireless one would work well, but this is not the case. If you are considering purchasing this router, I highly, highly suggest you consider a Belkin instead.</review>

<review id="9491">My Original review on Aug. 10:After finishing this book, I have no idea why it was written other than an excited writer's desire to fulfill a publisher's request as soon as possible. The writing was unevolved, and the sheer number of editorial errors proves how quickly both editor and author worked to release this book. Most of the issues that were brought up in the first two books were dropped in this one. To make matters worse, new issues abound that make the "willing suspension of disbelief" impossible, plot points are picked up and ignored randomly without any real twists or conclusions (except Vicky, of course), and you aren't really left with a character to love: Jake's forceful and annoying, Bella's negative and a martyr, Alice is pushy and superficial, and Edward is far too selfless.The first and last part of the book is filled with bickering and grumbling which is used to set a stage for Meyer's beautiful and witty sarcasm, but does little to enhance the plot. Without ruining anything, I'll just say that there actually comes a point where Bella has to resign herself to being with Edward. In general, the relationship between them is so obviously codependent and unhealthy, without any basis in a reality, that it's lost all of its original touching reluctance. By the end of the book, Bella's constant victim-stance, her bickering, complaining, whining, and general inability to be happy has ruined the book. UPDATE September 3, 2007: I am now absolutely DISGUSTED with both Meyers and her publisher. As soon as the rating fell below four stars, and almost all of the reviews commented on the same negative attributes, suddenly the reviews are flooded with five star, four sentence reviews from people who have nearly identical reviews on every other books they've posted for - falling in line with the newer trend of buying reviews for books. Shame on you Ms. Meyers for not letting your product stand on its own, and shame on you for disrespecting the loyal followers of your series in such a manner by telling them that their opinions are worth as much as cheaply bought props.</review>

<review id="9495">This book just tells you what different restaurants offer, calories, and suggested alternatives.

<review id="9496">I was really looking forward to viewing this documentary about various religions.  Bill Maher was quick to point out the numerous flaws and problems facing numerous religions and their blatent cosmological errors, both historically, socially, ethically, et al.  Maher's eager to pick apart Christianity, the Muslim faith, Scientology, Latter Day Saints,...HOWEVER when we come to Judaism we find Bill is BLANTANTLY protective!  Instead he criticizes a Jew who is anti-Zionist.  This is crucial, for Maher can't seem to be direct in his criticism of Judaism, he's only willing to pigeonhole a Jew who doesn't believe in Zionism.  Hey Bill, how about Jews thinking they're a chosen people?, how about Jews practicing apartheid in Israel?, how about the genocide of Palestinians?, how about kosher tax?!  This and MANY more issues could have been brought to light; just like Maher did with the other religions, instead Maher passed the buck because he's a coward, and he obviously can't bring the same criticism on Jews that he can against others.  Bill, you dissapoint me, and you make yourself look like a giant flaming hypocrite!</review>

<review id="9499">This keyboard is so poorly designed it's not even funny and it is way too expensive for what it is. It is only a USB and does not have an adaptor for PS hookup. The keys are silver instead of white hence making the reading of letters very difficult in any light condition with or without the backlighting of the unit itself. The lighting is not uniform throughout the keyboard. The wrist rest comes off all the time. I got so frustrated that after a while I just threw it away and went back to my old keyboard. It is not as quiet as some claim and if there was a zero star rating this thing would have certainly gotten it. I bet anything that nobody who produces this keyboard even uses it! so do NOT  waste your money on this junk.</review>

<review id="9500">I have used white noise generators for many years.  I wanted a light-weight battery operated one for foreign travel and camping where electrical power is not readily available.  For this purpose the unit works moderately well.   The only useful sound for me is the waterfalls sound.  This is the only frequency that will partially drown out low frequency sounds like snoring.  Other sounds are cute but not too useful and, in fact, distracting.  I have found the same defect as other reviewers.  The on/off/volume switch is of poor quality.  It malfunctioned early on.  The unit will still work but one has to "exercise" the knob to get it to work.  Sometimes the unit simply shuts off by itself in the middle of the night.  Hometics needs to spend more then $0.25 on the switch.</review>

<review id="9501">As a fan of the Twilight books, this movie was very, very disappointing.  Perhaps if I had not read the books beforehand, I might've tolerated the movie.  I understand that when movies are based on books, things need to be taken out and sometimes changed around but why add in things that are not necessary?  There were lines that were added into the movie that were so cheesy and didn't make any sense.  "You better hang on, spider-monkey."  Whaaaa???  The last scene of the movie when Victoria is watching them dance just ruined the credibility of the whole movie.  Edward can read minds and Alice can see the future.  Don't you think Edward would've known she was standing there?  The Harry Potter movies got it right in that they took stuff out, but didn't add anything in that was unnecessary.  I spent the entire movie thinking, "no that didn't happen" and "why would they do that?"I understand that they were trying to make the movie more teen friendly, but turning Bella's human friends into idiots didn't help things much.  What was up with the Eric Yorkie character?  "Look Bella, a worm!  Hehehehe!"  Wtf???  It says a lot about how film makers view the youth of today.  We go from "Rebel Without a Cause" and "The Breakfast Club" to this?  Dumbing down things for the teens does them a huge disservice.  And what about the fans of the Twilight series who are not teens?  There are many of us.  Furthermore, could they have picked a more annoying Bella?  I couldn't help wondering watching the movie if she had breathing and eye problems because she sighed and blinked so damn much.  If that's her way of trying to show intensity, it doesn't work.  And what's up with the stuttering? Not to mention the fact that she was a little too tomboyish to play Bella.  Kristen Stewart was all wrong for this part.  Robert Pattinson was perfect looks wise, but his acting was very wooden.  It just felt like he was uncomfortable playing the role, which in interviews, he did admit to.  It shows.  I hope he improves in the next movie, but there's no hope for Kristen Stewart.  The director failed miserably to convince me of Edward and Bella's intense love.  There are so many scenes in the book (like the intense cafeteria conversations and the bedroom scenes) that they could've easily put in the movie.  Why leave them out?  They were so pivotal to the story.  The only things they got right in my opinion were the Cullens (I liked who they chose, but they didn't have many chances to act, so we'll see in the next movies) and Forks, itself.  I sincerely hope that the director of New Moon takes a cue from Harry Potter and remains true to the book.</review>

<review id="9505">One again the annoyances outweigh the use of this product. I am really getting annoyed by the kitchenaid idea of poor engieering but who cares attitude. The engagement for this attachment like all of their attachments is to slide onto the horizontal drive shaft and to lock into place via a pin and bolt that is supposed to hold everything in place. Eventually in the process of grinding, the bolt works loose the pin slips and the entire grinder begins to spin. Now if you have the speed high this could be serious. And if something gets in the way of the spinning grinder then the whole mixer torques over on its side. Bad News!!!!!!!!! Another safty issue is that the mixer shaft does not disengage so it is possible to get loose clothing caught around the rotating shaft below. Once again I am baffled as to why kitchaid mixers are held up to being the high standard. Save your money on this very expensive attachment and get a real grinder.</review>

<review id="9506">Well we have already gotten rid of this and are back to the old litter box.  Our two cats had no problem adjusting to it.  However, the cartrdiges needed to be replaced in about a week, and are quite pricey.  Also the raking mechanism which I referred to as the poop zamboni often missed deposits and left them there, or got them caught up in the rake, not pretty.  In the end this was a very expensive product that was not worth it for us.</review>

<review id="9507">Pros: Everything I was looking for in a keyboard. It's backlit, which is a fantastic feature in a dark room. The key response is very nice. Not too soft and not too hard.Cons: I use it quit a bit for gaming, with the home keys receiving most of the use. The paint has worn off badly on the A,S,and D keys and is starting to wear on the X key. The problem with this is that if you're not an excellent typist and need to look at the keys in a dark room the characters are gone on these keys and all you see is light shining through.The company said they can't replace the keys, but I had to ship the keyboard back to them and they would look into the problem. Not the answer I was looking for. Had they backpainted the keys instead, you wouldn't be able to wear the paint off the keytops and obliterate the characters.I wouldn't purchase another one.</review>

<review id="9508">I was excited to try a highly-rated mp3 player that wasn't an iProduct.  When I received the player, I happily spent the better part of an afternoon loading software and figuring out my new toy.  Sure, I had to stick a pin in the hole and reset the player a couple of times, but we're just working out the kinks, right?  No problem that the Zen doesn't sync with iTunes, either, because that was the whole point, wasn't it - to break away from the iBehemoth.  And so what if the Creative Zen software is total crap.  It's a plays-for-sure device, so I should have no problem using it with my media player of choice (that's not iTunes).So why does WinAmp keep crashing every time I try to sync the device?  After a couple days of experimenting and reading forums it turns out that WinAmp doesn't work if Windows Media Player 11 is installed.  Okay.  Tried uninstalling WMP 11 - but it didn't help.  That's okay, there are a lot of other players I can use to sync up.  Foobar 2000 doesn't support portable devices yet, neither does Songbird.  Real Player is okay, but the smart playlists don't have many options and data doesn't sync back from the device to the library.  Ditto for Media Jukebox 12 and Media Monkey, who likes to crash almost as much as WinAmp, but for no reason I can find.  After a week of searching (and frequent resetting of the Zen with my trusty pin - keep one in the car and another by your computer!) I finally settled on WMP 11.  The Auto Playlists are decent, and WMP is the ONLY media player that will actually update the play count, ratings, and other changes made in the Zen.  Yay.  Too bad WMP has no Podcast support to speak of - although there's Doppler and Juice, both of which were buggy for me and crashed frequently.  Last night (13 days after ordering the Zen) I tried FeedDemon for my podcasts, liked it okay, and felt like I had a system that could work.  My wife was grateful she wouldn't be going to bed alone anymore, now that I had everything figured out.So today my Zen crashes and won't reset.  Instead, when I try, I notice that the back of the player feels warm.  Directly behind the center buttons.  Hmm.  Really warm.  Yowzers!  It's getting hot!  And you can smell burning/melting silicone (?) plastic (?) whatever.  And the heat is spreading slowly from the edge to the center of the player.Quick!  Customer support.  I can't find a phone number on the website, but here's an email option.  Help!  my Zen is burning up and I can't reset it.  Send.  Auto reply says their normal response time is 24 hours.  Hopefully this thing won't burst into flame before then.  Actually, I do get a relatively prompt reply, only two hours later.  Via email, Mac asks me to plug the player into a REAR USB port and instructs me on how to reset the player by inserting a pin into the hole.  Believe me, Mac, I'm an expert at resetting the player.  And I don't think that's going to put out the little fire that's eating my Zen player from the inside out.  Tell you what.  Instead of trying to diagnose my problem via email, I'm just going to send this puppy back to Amazon.com and ask for a refund.Just as soon as it's safe to put in a cardboard box.Hello iTunes.  Did you miss me as much as I missed you?</review>

<review id="9510">The people who rate this box high must work for the company.  I don't like this box one bit.  It was easy enough to assemble but to clean the litter you have to roll it all the way over practically upside down and when you do, the clay dust floats up and out of the front, even when gently rolling it. My cat is 8 lbs, she eats IAMS or Science Diet food and her poops are small but they do not all go into the cup when you roll it over, some fall through that grate on the side and you have to scoop them out by hand.  Use your logic - how can you roll a box 3/4 turn - practically onto its top (as recommended by vendor) and expect this to work as stated.    When my cat pees, she scrapes the litter to make a hole for herself and the pee sticks to the bottom of the box, it does not loosen when you roll it - so again, scoop it by hand. SAVE YOUR MONEY - if you hate to scoop, the best stuff I found so far is a regular litter box but fill it with 2" of the Fresh Scoop CRYSTALS - they absorb pee so you never have to scrape pee off the bottom and the poop may not clump into a ball of clay but if lifts right out.  All you have to do with crystals is rake them so the distribute them and you can do that when you scoop out the poop every day.  Change the crystals,  completely empty and refill with another 2" every 2 weeks according to directions because they do absorb pee but they do not stink up the way clay does.Bottom line is you spend more time rolling the thing over and back - waiting to let the litter fall back through the grate and then shaking the box to even the distribution of litter and then you still have to empty the poop container anyway.  Save time and your money and just scooping out a little poop every day.  This box is not worth the $$$.  Get the Fresh Scoop CRYSTALS instead.</review>

<review id="9511">First of all, I purchased the Zen (8gb)from Amazon. Their service has always been outstanding.I feel that Creative didn't make a good player because I had to return the replaced Zen because it also stopped working. The first one stopped responding while I was trying to charge it for the first time. The second unit broke in two weeks. Both had the same problem: little blue light on the power switch comes on, and the screen does not turn on.I researched a lot before buying this product. Too bad it's got problems. I would buy it again if I could finally get a non-defective product.</review>

<review id="9515">I just bought a MacBook Pro 15". I love it. I am an Attorney and so I was concerned about making sure everything I produce on this machine is compatible with microsoft documents and programs. I bought the Macbook Pro because I didn't want to deal with Vista and because I am over microsoft in general --hot fixes, service packs, all sorts of SLOP work...and then this most recent and astounding inability to produce a stable product. Anyway, it was a big deal for me to buy a Macbook Pro rather than a Toshiba with Vista preloaded..I digress.THE PROBLEM: I loaded microsoft Office for Mac, 2008 Home and Student Edition with hopes of using it. I shortly found that COMMON fonts do not transfer in Word, Excel does not work as smoothly and then I received a "Welcome to Entourage" email from microsoft that literally overwrote a weeks worth of emails. Poof! all gone! (gratefully I only had a weeks worth before my welcome email) I called microsoft to ask if there was a way to unwrite the overwritten and was promptly told that I need to establish a "case number" before they could process my inquiry. A Case number? good grief---A CASE NUMBER. Is it that bad? Yes, I could see how many companies may want to sue microsoft for all kinds of things right now. Anyway,  I promptly uninstalled Office for Mac 2008  and I will return it. Maybe microsoft  will decide to fix this BETA, surely we can expect microsoft to  service pack/ hot fix this product to death and then MAYBE in six months at least something as minor as the default settings will coincide with the real world. THE SOLUTION: I partitioned the hard drive on my macbook, installed WINDOWS XP and loaded  my copy of 2003 Office Suite. Everything is perfect now. I get to have the very best laptop in the world and all this great functioning apple software (If you haven't made the switch---you will love Apple --it's so clean).  I can create documents (because I must) THAT DON'T CRASH on the other side of my mac HD (the dark side). It's like having two computers in one; the preferred being the Apple. Why can't Apple make microsoft Office? (yes I really do know why). THE FUTURE: Will I ever install a microsoft product onto the mac side of my HD again? --Not until mircosoft decides to come clean and deliver a product that isn't messed up. Who do these people think they are? How long do they think we'll just take it?      Well, this time I didn't take it, instead---- I took it back.</review>

<review id="9516">I've had two of these - the first was replaced after some months of use, when first the belt clip/holder broke, shortly followed by the clip on the lanyard - the pedometer itself is still functional though.  The second one lasted less than a weekend - the new version of the belt clip doesn't hold securely enough and I lost my new pedometer on the second day of wearing it.  It's a shame that such a good product is let down by the accesories.

<review id="9517">I have deleted my previous review from 01.16.09 and am now re-posting. I got my device and was anxious to use it, however, was unable to install due to some random Java issues. I tried calling the company, and was unable to hold for a rep, rather I had to leave a message. A rep called me back and left a message saying she would call at a certain time. That call never happened- fueling my frustration. I emailed the founder of the company, and that seemed to really get the ball rolling. After 1.5 hours on the phone with the rep (who was patient and very helpful) we got the issue fixed. Another issue I had was this morning I tried to log in, to no avail. My first thought was 'here we go again'. I emailed support and they got back to me right away saying that they were doing maintenance to the system, and it should be up in a few hours. Thats fine, but how about posting a note on your web site to let customers know that. Apparently, this is a small company, and they may not have the bandwith to support all their new customers. I am a big fan of small business, and had this been communicated to me, I would not have been so upset in the first place. It is all about setting the right expectation, then following through. Customer service it really is about communication, in my opinion. That being said, I think the device, and what you get out of it is pretty nifty. Just be aware that the support (right now) is not the best, and if you are impatient like myself, it might drive you batty. I will post an update in a few weeks to give an update on how the device has worked and how services has been. 02.25.09 Update- Having technical issues AGAIN. It should NOT be this difficult. The problems seem to reside with the software, and not the device itself.</review>

<review id="9525">If there was any way I could give this film negative stars, I would do it. Casino Royale was one of the best -- if not THE best -- bond movies ever made. Despite some people's criticism of Daniel Craig, personally, I feel that he is the best bond ever to step into the role...perhaps even better than Connery. Now believe me, coming from a major Connery fan, that is high praise.And then, there's this movie. I'm not sure if I could even call it a movie. You see, movies typically have a few components. They have scenes and dialog, which come together to form story and plot. Movies use actors, sets and props to achieve this goal. From what we could tell, this movie did not have scenes, did not have dialog, did not have sets, and perhaps had some props and actors, although one was rarely privileged enough to see an actor on screen long enough to see if he was talking, winking, or throwing us the bird. In fact, in one extremely cowardly "not-scene", bond walks into an elevator escorted by four agents. The elevator door closes, and then momentarily re-opens with the four agents unconscious on the ground, as Bond walks calmly out. Now I don't care if you are a die-hard Bond fan or just a movie fan in general, that is ridiculous. Since when did Bond become an episode of Loony Toons?The reason there are no scenes in this movie is that a scene must involve at least five seconds of contiguous content which is comprehensible to the audience. I do not believe there was a single, contiguous five seconds of film in this entire travesty of a movie. My wife and daughter and I were in the theater during the first scene, which may have been a car chase, and we were looking back and forth at each other with confused expressions. We think the chase ended with someone flying off a cliff (or the top of a building? hard to say). We think there were three cars, except none of us could explain where the third one came from or went to. Shortly thereafter there was a boat chase. Our dialog in our seats during the boat chase sounded something like this.me: "Is that a boat chasing them?"wife: "I can't tell. I think so."daughter: "No, wait, I think it's two boats."me: "Two boats? Are you sure."wife: "..."daughter: "..."me: "...Wait a second, there have to be three boats!"daughter: "why?"me: "Because I think one just exploded, and I still keep seeing at least two distinct boat hulls."wife: "I thought that was the car on the dock that just exploded."me & daughter: "There was a dock???"That pretty much describes the entire movie, beginning to end. Now, I'm an astute moviegoer. I am the one who figures out who the bad guy is in the movie before anybody else does. I'm the one who figures out what's going on, and I was so totally and completely lost in this one that I still don't have even the smallest clue who the bad guy was, who the good guy was, what happened, and what bond was looking for in that burning building at the end. I can't possibly spoil the plot for anyone who reads this review, because there wasn't one. In fact, the only reason I made my wife and teenage daughter sit through the rest of this movie is that I wanted to try to come up with more ammo to use against it when I reviewed it. Unfortunately, there was so little substance to this movie that it didn't even give me anything else to criticize. There just wasn't anything there.Casino Royale was an incredible movie, and probably my all-time favorite Bond movie. Why they got the guys from "The Bourne Steady-Cam-Ectomy" to come work on a Bond movie is beyond me. Weren't Bourne 2 and 3 bad enough to teach them a lesson? Why did they pay a great actor like Daniel Craig to reprise his role, but then hide his face and prevent him from acting for the entire movie? Why would they create a Bond film that was so bad that I would rather watch two straight hours of the Jar Jar Binks scenes from Star Wars Episode I?This is quite possibly the worst movie ever made: not as a Bond movie, but just as a movie in general. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE.[EDIT]Since I have received some comments about talking in the theater, I would like to point out that my wife, my daughter and myself were the only ones in the theater at the time. We saw it near the end of its run, and nobody in our small town was foolish enough to come back and see it a second time. Apparently our town has an average IQ over 70.That said, I hope those who comment on my review will focus on its content rather than the fact that we were talking in an otherwise empty theater.</review>

<review id="9526">Caution: There are a few spoilers to follow.  I am 55 years old and my daughter is 17.  She is beginning "Eclipse," and I am about 100 pages into "Breaking Dawn."  I enjoyed "Twilight," and thought that it was a nice take on "Romeo and Juliet."  I have become increasingly disenchanted with books #2 and 3 for many of the same reasons others have cited (Bella has become a selfish whiner, the writing is repetitious, it takes forever for something to happen, etc.)  I am really disliking "Breaking Dawn," however.  If this series is truly designed for young women, and I suspect many who are reading it are in the pre-teen to young teenager category, then I have to strongly object to the ever-increasing sex scenes and the macabre, stomach-turning plot.  Do young girls really have to read about Bella and her black lingerie being shredded during a night of vampire passion, even if she is married to the vampire?  Do we have to read about how vampires feel about menstruation? Is it really okay for young women to assume that waking up the morning after covered with bruises, even if Edward didn't mean to, is okay?  And what happens to Bella after the honeymoon, which is where I currently am in the book, is turning my stomach.  I would venture to guess that even dedicated Edward lovers may be repulsed. Is it okay for a woman's husband to propose that he share her with another man?  At this point I am forcing myself to finish the book so that my daughter and I can discuss it, but it is not enjoyable reading.  This series sends a number of mixed messages to girls that I don't think are positive and, in some cases, are quite disturbing and even sick.</review>

<review id="9527">I bought this for school- everyone uses Word. But after a year, things started to go missing- the language tool (I needed it for French class), the columns tool, I no longer have a thesaurus, spell check only edits certain words now. I have tried for months to get Microsoft to help me with the problem. After a run-around, I was told that I could not be helped. Why did I spend my money? Who knows. But buyer beware- should things go wrong, you're on your own.</review>

<review id="9528">I followed the directions exactly and got no foam whatsoever. The result was as if I had put a straw in the milk and started blowing bubbles. Oh, and it turned the milk a weird texture like the lactose and water were separating. I was using nonfat milk but I don't think it makes a difference since they claim you can use any type of milk.</review>

<review id="9529">First unit exhibited phantom button selections and was unusable. The Saitek web site was not helpful, and I was told to return unit for replacement by thier tech rep.Return and replacement by Amazon went very smoothly. Good job there.Second Unit had similar problems as well as x and y axis signal spikes that made control impossible. Have returned second unit for refund.If you go to Saitek site as I did and try to move into forums, I was unable to get to the "good stuff" until I registered on the forum. So a casual look reveals no complaints; and a more determined investigation shows very few favorable users and a bunch of disgruntled users world wide.One very troubling comment included photos of the interior of the yoke itself. Poor workmanship was in high evidence.The yoke felt much better than the CH yoke, and I liked the position of the controls; but it didn't work. Hopefully, Saitek will get the quality control problems solved and this thing will become usable.</review>

<review id="9530">I was going to buy this stick blender, and then I read a review with some troubling info, so I switched to the Braun Multiquick, and I'm really glad I did.According to the review I read, this Cuisinart Smart Stick can only be used for 15 seconds at a time, according to the manual.  The parts are not dishwasher safe.  And it only has one speed - on or off.The Braun Multiquick, on the other hand, is AWESOME. All parts but the motor are dishwasher safe.  It has several speeds - I think 10 - plus a "turbo" mode.  And you can use it as long as you want - no 15-second limit.  I use it for everything. I puree soups right in the pot without the mess of transferring to a food processor. We make smoothies in the large cup that comes with it, which fits the stick blender perfectly. And even though I wasn't really interested in having the blender-looking attachment, I use it all the time. In fact, the 400 watt motor makes it a lot more powerful than our "real" blender. It makes mincemeat of ice and frozen berries. The other thing I love is the "turbo" mode - it's just so powerful, it zips through everything.</review>

<review id="9531">The unit broke the 3rd time I used it. The 3 times it did work it just was not power full or easy to use. The button is hard to push and the cord is to short... You can do much better then this thing.</review>

<review id="9532">"Reality" TV is a fave with many people these days so I wasn't surprised by this "realistic" reworking of Battlestar Galactica. I was never a huge fan of Battlestar Galactica, but it was fun escapism. I'm more of a fan of original Trek, TNG, Star Gate, Farscape, and Firelfy. New Galactica is more of a sci fi series for those who don't like sci fi. It's more of a "realistic" drama. There will be no exploration of various different alien worlds and cultures. I don't find myself captivated by it. It's too much like the West Wing for me. You might want try a different purchase if you are the type of sci fi fan who doesn't like TV dramas like the West Wing.</review>

<review id="9533">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)      I find this absolutely halarious.Apparently there are over a hundred reviews of a dvd THAT HAS NOT COME OUT YET.This isn't rotten tomatoes, you're supposed to rate the "item", not the film. That means you should be rating the special effects, video quality, etc. Seeing as how almost none of you have seen these, why are you all making reviews?It'd be nice if people remembered just what these comments are supposed to be for (and yes i do realize i'm not commenting on the item either but this is the only way to get this message across). Please stop rating this amazing film and wait for the dvd to come out.</review>

<review id="9534">I initially liked the fact that the Vado had a 2" screen and that it was small and light.  After using the Vado for a little while though, I realized that the color on the screen wasn't good.  It's got a blue tint, and it's kinda hard to see outside.  The flip out USB connector is a pain.  I wish there were a USB cable included.  It's awkward to have the camera hanging off the side of my computer.  The kicker though, is that it was a pain to load the videos onto my Mac and play them there.The camera works pretty well, and it doesn't cost much, but ... with no optical zoom and the problems above, it's not great.</review>

<review id="9535">Rather than write a new review, I'll just show you the comments I left at Intuit after I finished my taxes.  I hope this helps others when deciding to buy this product or not."1) E-Filing should in principle always be included with the price of the product.  2) Having a "free federal E-File" while charging for the state E-File was not clear, and surely fooled a lot of customers, including me, as you surely intended.  3) The screen for entering capital gains via spreadsheet was extremely buggy.  4) The screen for capital loss carryovers was very poorly worded, and I'm still not sure if I entered the data correctly.  5) The Live Community Forum is a blatant attempt at dumping tech support questions on a bunch of other helpless Turbotax customers rather than do the tech support yourselves.  And by the way, I never received an answer to my questions.  6) The IRA to Roth conversion screens were very confusing.  7) You don't offer a Professional Review for the state products.  8) Requiring me to install Acrobat Reader, when I already had a differently branded .pdf file reader program, was unnecessary and annoying.  9) Turbotax, once all the b.s. fees are added on, is so expensive that it is probably better to just pay a professional tax preparer.  It might even cost roughly the same."</review>

<review id="9537">I bought these sheets based on the number of good reviews. It took several months to receive them as others have said, but I'm far more disappointed in the quality.

Putting my face on the pillow is like sleeping against cheap wool. They're horrible.</review>

<review id="9538">Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac Home & Student Edition I was eagerly awaiting new features and better performance with Leopard. To begin with a flaw makes registering your software online impossible. I had to call...they acknowledged it was a problem. I use Excel for so many things. This new version would crash every few minutes during use to the point that it wasn't worth using. I checked and it is a common complaint. Some view options turn on and off by themself.  Office app saved documents don't remember window size or location when reopened. Finally so far, Word and Excel are very slow...much slower than Office 2004! I took the plunge and purchase iWork 08 and I'm quite happy with the Excel compatible spreadsheet. I thought Mac versions of Microsoft products were usually better than their Windows counterparts. If so, I feel sorry for Windows users. Oh yes, I'm not one to usually nitpick or complain a lot.</review>

<review id="9542">A required form (IRS Form 8910) was unavailable (but was available in Turbotax), so the return could not be completed. The chat help person promised this form along with the scheduled updates 3 times (Feb 1, Feb 15, Mar 4), but the form never came as part of these updates). The chat help people didn't seem to have a clue. They were unable to tell me why Turbotax provided the form, while they could not. Also, the interview was not as good as Turbotax's. There were several ambiguous questions, which I had to guess as to their meaning, which the generic help did little to clarify.</review>

<review id="9543">This egg cooker was a true delight for several months, and was used about every other week. It was highly efficient, made eggs perfectly, and was reasonably easy to clean. Its use was as recommended by the manual.Then, two days ago the house filled with the stench of melting plastic. When it was traced back to the egg cooker, it appeared switched off but was in fact burning into overdrive. The plastic canopy had melted like Dali's clocks, and begun to sag over some hard boiled eggs left from the night before. I unplugged the cooker, and discovered that the canopy had melted into the base and was fastened tight.Not only was it completely ruined, but if this had happened when no one was at home, it might have even burned down the house!In spite of all of this device's very positive qualities, this is clearly a fatal flaw and cannot be recommended. Oster should recall this model and overhaul the design for safety purposes.</review>

<review id="9545">I previously was loved all HP products. I owned my previous HP Pavillion Laptop for over six years and it did not have any major issues. So I bought another HP as my new laptop. This one is pure disappointment. It started to work slow within few weeks. It does not matter what we do we cannot improve its performance. After a month or so computer started to crash to the point that nothing could turn it on then randomly start working as if nothing happened. Finnaly, six months into use it crashed again and I was not able to restart it. After hours with HP help from India, whom it is very hard to understand. It took so much time for me to spell all my information out. He kept on asking the same questiosn over and over. With techichian's help, I was able to start my computer but after all the setting that he suggested my computer crashes every time I close the screen. I am dreading calling India again.... This computer cannot support any graphic games. My husband tried downloading GTA and there is no way you can play it on this computer.    HP is not what it used to be... look for quality somewhere else. In addition, check if the company uses Indian workers as customer service and avoid them you will save yourself hours. For me it is time to look for different company for my electronic products.</review>

<review id="9546">I have used nearly every version of Microsoft Office since 1994. So, I looked forward to using Office 2007. To say the least I was disappointed. I feel that this product is aimed at novice or weak users who might feel more at home using a product like Microsoft Works or perhaps the "Home" version rather than a professional product version. I suppose that its new "ribbon" interface would be of some value to new users of Office who might not have much previous experience with the product. However, I'll bet that after a bit of use the "ribbon" will become as tiresome as it became to me. From my point-of-view, I had a number of problems with the product.1. The old "File" functions (Save, Open, etc.) are hidden until you click on a non-descript icon. Why not have "File" option on the menu bar? If the term "File" is too passe then at least call it something.2. Each one of the new "ribbons" is loaded with stuff that is seldom used by most Office users. And, in so doing, these always take up an excessive amount of screen space. I didn't like that I had to click on each of the menu choices to drop down the corresponding "ribbon". These were not organized in the manner I was used to and I didn't know where some things were that I often use. In previous versions just moving the mouse pointer over the menu item dropped the corresponding list of functions. Maybe there is an option for this buried somewhere to do this but it couldn't be found if so.3. The installation default for the ribbon is to disappear after one function is performed. I found this very frustrating. At last I found an option that would retain the "ribbon" after each use but then I was stuck with it until I turned the option off. The old pre-defined (but customizable) toolbars, which usually take up less space, are gone. Yes, you can make an optional custom toolbar as well. However, you can do the same in previous versions without the "ribbons" clutter.4. There is no option to revert this "ribbon" setup to the Office 2003 menu / toolbar setup. (I'll bet that there will be one in the next release or two).5. There are very few new capabilities in this product for most mortal Office users.In short, I recommend that you find a version of Office 2003 rather than buy this one. If you already have Office 2003, save your money.</review>

<review id="9548">I scoured over the reviews on Amazon for the right coffee maker to replace the shoddy one that I had from college. The Zojirushi fit pefectly. There is an abundance of positive feedback from other customers. After receiving mine, I agreed with most of the positive feedback. It's easy to use, cleans up easily, and makes a hot cup of coffee. I particularly was pleased with the Thermal Carafe, which was a feature I was looking for while shopping. My problems arose from the coffee itself. After trying different beans and varied amounts, I could not make a strong cup of coffee. In fact, my wife and I agreed that the coffee had very little flavor at all. We decided to return this item because of the flavor. For US$90 I should get not just a great functioning coffee maker, but also a great tasting cup of coffee as well.</review>

<review id="9550">*spoiler alertI had alot more faith in Stephenie Meyer than this. She knew how much her fans were anticipating this book and it doesnt even have a substantial developing plotline. This book is completely lacking the twilight charm that the three previous installments have.Basically, it gets as crazy as you can get with a book written about vampires and werewolves. Situation after situation is thrown in your face. Anticipated key events are written with the breeze (not in a good way). And key characters have all of a sudden acquired different personalities. For a book that originally seemed to have supported the idea of self-sacrifice, I have to say I couldnt find many examples, well atleast ones that made sense to me, in this one. Bella having a baby wasnt self sacrifical to me. She was selfishly wanting to keep it because it was Edwards, even though it was eating its way out of her.Im not going to go overboard with my negativity, but I cant help but rant about this. Its was definitely surprising to me when Bella has a child. Okay. I was willing to go that far. A child who basically, lovingly ate her way out of her mommys womb? It saddens me that I have to imagine Bellas and Edwards lovechild in this way. Bella named her what else? Oh, of course. Resemee. How exotic and unique and sentimental. More like, absolutely ridiculous! Everytime I hear that damn name it reminds me of the Tresemme' shampoo commercial. Now I cant think of twilight the same. Whenever I think upon it, I will forever associate it with shampoo ads playing in my head.</review>

<review id="9551">Three words, WTF? . After watching this movie, I thought about joining the armed forces so I could go exact some type of mindless violence on some unsuspecting individual I did not know in some foreign country with an unpronounceable name. Not only am I a fan, I now feel as if my sole mission in life is to educate those individuals who think they are fans, along with those whose first encounter with the Transformers will be this film, as to what they should expect, and more importantly what they should accept. I have traveled around the globe, bid vigorously on eBay, and sacrificed much in an attempt to acquire the toys I need to create the ultimate collection. Not a complete collection, but a collection that will one day, hopefully, be part of a Transformer display of museum quality. I have learned some Japanese, and manipulated 2 of my siblings into learning the language and the culture of the creators so that I might create a seamless conjunction of timelines to aid in my mission; (you may have even read one of their reviews.)This travesty of a movie was so terrible, I believe many viewers were left in such denial as to be unable to provide rational reviews. Many fans wanted this movie to be so great so badly they must have become delusional, their minds creating the story they wanted to see. I challenge everyone who saw this movie to ask themselves, their friends, what happened during the movie. You will find yourselves drawing a blank. Those who have seen this flick more than once have done so only because subconsciously your trying to fill in the blank. Think about it.I have, and while I can quote lines from the 1st movie verbatim, I have a hard time remembering anything about this movie other than the scenty, dangly thing hanging on Bumblebee's mirror...you know what I am talking about. Bah weep grahn ah weep ninee bahm. Another issue I have, not just with the movie, is the latest obsession with every Autobot Leader being Optimus Prime, and every Decepticon Leader being Megatron. If you are going to use these names you had d@#m well better put them in the movie. Optimus was a basic rig and Megatron was a gun. And, do not make excuses about mass to size ratios and gun laws. Anyone who has ever seen the Transformers knows that part of their arsenal of advanced technology includes mass shifting and subspace shunts. Their aliens for crying out loud, but they are not bugs. Furthermore, the question everyone should have been asking was "Where did Optimus Prime's trailer go?" Not, "Why does he have a mouth?" Anybody involved in filmmaking or entertainment knows that a good story always has underlying themes. With the Transformers there were several. The proverbial battle between good and evil, the integration of biblical undertones, the political influence of the time; The Cold War, (why do you think the good guys had blue eyes and the bad guys had red eyes?) Even the names meant something. The name Optimus Prime, for example, is derived from the Latin words for best, and another meaning 1st in occurrence, and Megatron, mega meaning large/great/powerful and tron meaning machine. This movie does not possess any of these aspects. In layman's terms...it suc?ed big time.Yes, I am a '80s child as well. I watched the cartoons and had the toys. Heck, I still have many of them still in the box; OCD. The whole machine to robot thing has always been awesome. Even now, I have some hope that the sequel will adhere to the spirit of the legend Transformers has become.The special effects were great, the actors too. Unfortunately, there were too humans and not enough Transformers. The storyline behind this movie blew, and the movie ended with a whimper, not a bang. Too much of this movie was spent on the wrong thing, much like Deep Impact. This movie is supposed to be about TRANSFORMERS. The plot had massive holes through it, especially in the final scene. I would strongly recommend that original fans of the 80's cartoon stay away from this movie. In addition, I also recommend that you write to Hasbro and tell them to get it together. If you see it you will be disappointed. The 80s cartoon movie was so much better than this in terms of storyline. Michael Bay is now on my list of most hated directors. Brian Goldner allowed Transformers to be distasteful and obnoxious, though I am not surprised considering his track record and lack of interest in the Transformers until he realized just how much money they can generate.Why throw away your money so recklessly? That is the question you should ask yourself. Do yourself a favor...rent it. 'Till all are one.</review>

<review id="9552">I won't buy another Sharp product.  I thought they had a good reputation and the microwave was no exception until, like most microwaves, it stopped working properly after a number of years.  This particular problem is especially alarming, though: it turned itself on while unattended!  Most of the microwave instructions I've read say not to use the microwave with nothing in it because it can be a fire hazard.  Yet, from time to time, this thing would just start running on its own and it scared the heck out of me.  It continued to function when I wanted it to, but starting up on its own was a definite hazard.  I kept it unplugged when not in use, until I finally put it out with the trash.  I contacted Sharp and asked if there was a safety recall for the model I had, but they said there wasn't one.  I find it hard to believe that I'm the only person who had this problem before, and Sharp did nothing to make things better.  I'm on my third Panasonic microwave, which tends to last more than five years at a time, and when they fail to work properly, they just don't work.  I will continue to trust Panasonic and will never trust Sharp again.  I can't afford to risk my house burning down while I'm asleep or away from the house.</review>

<review id="9553">I bought this DVD at O'Hare - the ulitmate impulse purchase. I sold it on Amazon two days later for $18. I allowed myself to be attracted to the worst reason for the use of store counter space since the fake set of rotten teeth one can buy at Halloween.This was a repulsive DVD. After 35 minutes I shut it off. Why do people need a shallow and ridiculous fantasy method to become more self-absorbed? More materialistic? Do we really need this moronic DVD and theory of attraction so we can lure the next expensive gold chain or BMW into our lives? Are these authors serious? Can't we all just remember that if we strive for meaningful goals through hard work, patience, and persistence we will get what we want most of the time? If we don't reach our goal we'll be stronger for jusd doing our best and we will not have wasted U.S. Treasury paper and ink on this joke of a theory of the law of attraction.</review>

<review id="9555">Long story .. bought the router 4+ months ago so my second computer could access the internet using Wireless connection. It didn't work - the signal was so weak and dropped every few seconds it was totally unusable. I tried every known fix, relocating the computers, all the frequencies, spent hours and hours on the phone to technical support... no solution found. So they suggested I got a cable connection instead. So I save my $'s and finally get this installed. Guess what? It didn't work at all!When I phoned technical support I was pleasantly surprised to get straight through to help... however instead of trying to help me get the wired connection working they insisted again on only trying to go through getting the wireless connection working. Having just spent hundreds of dollars getting the wiring installed and having gone through the wireless issue for weeks on the phone 4+ months ago I had no interest in the wireless connection whatsoever! The response to the cabled connection not working... was .. you must have a faulty cable!The help person kept insisting I should replace the cable immediately and didn't seem to understand that the cable went through walls! and it wasnt a 5 second job to replace the cable.I gave up on the call as they wouldn't help me.I then went away and played with the settings for 2 more days. Suddenly it one change and the cable connected computer link worked.. well it did for 4 weeks then it died. I phoned linksys tech support and after hours of playing about they told me to update the firmware (which I already had done) and ended the call.I went away and bought a D-Link router which works fine!</review>

After an hour of doing whatever we could, I am sending it back. Motor sounds bad with a beeping sound that would start every time it was turned on.

Unfortunately, when you buy their product from Amazon, Farouk does not honor the warranty.

Shame on you, Farouk! I'll never buy another one of your products!</review>

<review id="9562">This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)      I love Robert Downey, Jr., Ben Stiller & Jack Black.  I own several movies showcasing the enormous talents of all these men.  And of the immensely talented actors to star in this film, I own more of Tom Cruise's than any, not to mention Matthew McConnaughey.  Which is why this film was such an UNBELIEVEABLE DISAPPOINTMENT!(cue the Sam Kinison voice from beyond).I was actually on the verge of purchasing Tropic Thunder sight unseen, that is how much faith I have in the sheer comic and acting abilities of these fine actors.  This film, however, was such a slap in the face to the intelligence of the audience it targeted.And, no, I do not think they were making fun of our soldiers.  This movie makes fun of the military movies, not our troops.  I cannot believe folks cannot tell the difference, especially with obvious parodies of Rambo, Saving Private Ryan and Full Metal Jacket.However, there are only three funny scenes of the entire movie.  I actually made myself sit through the entire footage twice, I was in such disbelief that it failed to make me laugh.  Well, except those three parts:1) The opening film previews with Ben Stiller's Ramboish character, and the one with Robert Downey, Jr. and Tobey MacGuire as the gay priests, were hilarious - Jack Black's, however, with the farting family parodying the Nutty Professor family was simply infantile and moronic.2) Tom Cruise as super insane Hollywood agent Les Grossman was brilliant!  I recognized his voice and was blown away.3) Robert Downey, Jr.'s "You went full retard" speech to Ben Stiller.  That was priceless.  I apologize to those who take offense to the term "retard" but I am just as guilty of using it and I know this film makes fun of movies portraying handicapped individuals - again, it MAKES FUN OF MOVIES that portray, not makes fun directly of, or intentionally toward, actual handicapped.Anyway, those are the three funny parts, so you all can save your money.  I hope to see better from these guys in the future.  I was sorely disappointed, but apparently, I am joined by a mere few because this pathetic excuse for entertainmet was nominated for awards.Another important point is that, with the exception of Robert Downey, Jr. and Tom Cruise, these guys have been in kid-friendly films in the past.  Ben Stiller and Jack Black have been in quite a few movies geared directly toward the younger audience.  I don't think I had heard Ben Stiller ever utter the F word, so naturally I was stunned to hear it used every other sentence.  Who talks like that in everyday life?  Parents be warned, unless you're cool with your kids hearing all that.A disappointment.  Come on, guys.Sadly, it was such a huge hit, they will probably make a sequel or at least start cranking out more mindless dribble.</review>

<review id="9563">My first Cuisinart Brew Central lasted about six months and died. It would only make steam.  I replaced it under warranty at a total cost to me of $20.  The coffee maker sent under warranty is not covered for the full 3 year warranty, only for the remainder of the first coffeemaker's.My replacement(second) coffeemaker lasted about one and a half years and this morning finally died.  It has been shutting off midbrew for a few months.I am shopping for a new coffeemaker, not another Cuisinart.</review>

<review id="9564">This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)      For those of us parents who were expecting a movie as thoroughly enjoyable as Toy Story or Monsters Inc., which was highly entertaining for both the parents AND their preschool-aged children, this was a HUGE disappointment. None of us--my husband, I, and our children--enjoyed the movie. Having 3 little boys, I was excited by the prospect of a movie about robots made by Pixar. What better combination, I thought. Unfortunately, the movie is not about Wall-E or his story. It's about staring at the earth filled with mountains of garbage and watching a nearly personality-less robot make these mountains of garbage for extremely long periods of time. Since when have I ever sat in a movie theater and thought..."Okay, surely the story is going to start any moment" only to find out it never does? This is a first! Pixar failed miserably in utilizing a potentially great character to weave a cautionary tale--they wasted Wall-E! Instead of inspiring the spirit to take care of the earth, Pixar has nearly satirized the environmentalist message through the painfully long landscape scenes and lack of plot. The movie belabors the obvious. The robots are uninteresting and barely qualify as characters. Wall-E lacks the humor, excitement, and classic story-telling techniques I have come to expect from Pixar. This movie is certainly outside Pixar's box, and for that reason we were terribly disappointed.</review>

<review id="9565">I don't hate this product, because the less hair the better in general.BUT BUT BUT!!! From what I can tell with use on my long-haired American Eskimo, the tool actually thins the hair, it doesn't just remove dead and/or undercoat.  The tools' sharp edged "blade", the manufacturer actually calls it a blade, cuts out hair to thin it.  So, yes, you get off mounds of hair, but it might be hair you want to keep on the dog...you know, for a nice looking coat.  I will continue to use it sparingly (I think anyway), but only because my dog has a really thick coat and thinning isn't necessarily bad.  JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT YOUR'E THINNING/CUTTING good, bad, dead, live, over, under-coat, everything.  After using it, you'll clearly see that your dog's coat isn't as fluffy and looks thinner, and it's not just because you removed dead and undercoat!  I've done nothing scientific, but that's what I think is happening with this tool.I won't recommend it to friends without cautioning them about this, and telling them not to get mad at me if their dog's coats look meek and thin after use.</review>

<review id="9566">im quite happy with the service ive recieved from seller, however, the product itself is only average and i can tell ill be needing to purchase another juicer within a year... i had never owned a juicer bfore and the research i did didnt inform me the quality i was buying. reviews and ofcourse advertisements said it was quailty but its cheap and in only 5 uses ive noticed a reduction in performance, ie; its become much louder, blades instantly dulled from only carrot juicing, it also shoots the waste out the vent hole, i had to block it off to save washing the wall each time, like i said, with in a year or less ill be buying another and ill probably spend the money this time, dont buy a 'hamilton beach'</review>

<review id="9567">My coffee maker has been acting rather strange lately, I keep setting it on auto, only to wake up and find it doing a self clean.  Not my error either, this has been going on for a week.  I am about to chuck it in the bin as I am a coffee freak and hate waking up to crappy coffee which has been going through the self clean cycle for I don't know how long.  I thought this coffee maker would last for years since it is a good make and not exactly the cheapest around.  Well I am off to research coffee makers, cheers!</review>

<review id="9568">The box says it can act as a repeater with your existing network, however it is only compatable with other linksys routers and access points, a completely unnessecary restriction if you know anything about wireless networks. They use standard frequencies and languages, the only reason it would only work with certain routers is that linksys specifically wrote the firmware that way to force you to buy more of their products.This wouldn't suck so much if it said so ANYWHERE on the box, but it doesn't say it until you've installed the device and connect to configure it, then you get a small warning at the bottom of the menu that it will only work with their other products.</review>

<review id="9569">I thought this would work well but it has a couple of problems. First I will say that the directions are fine and explain how to get your dog used to it. My dog was already used to me using an emery board and this unit is not very loud. The problem is it's not a precision unit. The motor and shaft bearing is way too far from the emery wheel. It is coupled to the wheel with a long white plastic molded part that does not turn true. If you look at the wheel you will see a side to side motion that causes vibration when you push your dogs nail against it! Also, the space between the wheel and the guard is too big. If you use a slight turning motion so the nail doesn't get filed flat, the nail can get drawn in between the wheel and the guard. I have used dremel products for many years and they are a tool company and they know that the shaft bearing has to be very close to the collet and must be a precision bearing that will allow the sanding drum or other cutting tool to run true!! I do think a guard is a useful thing if it's designed properly and I wish dremel would come out with one that would screw onto existing moto-tools. I may make my own! Anyway, I'm going to try my dremel, maybe it's easier without the guard.</review>

<review id="9572">Last year I used Tax Cut.  Tax Cut has been carrying the same bug from year-to-year related to spousal IRAs.  I reported the bug, but the Tax Cut customer support gave me the run around.  So this year, I switched to TurboTax.  Next year, I am going back to Tax Cut.I filed my return in the first week of February.  I have had ot open the tax return to check on a few things.  Every time I open TurboTax, it has an update.  It is very disconcerting to continue to have multiple updates after I already filed my return.  I do not recall this happening with Tax Cut.  It makes me wonder if the return I filed was incorrect.I also uncovered a bug in TurboTax.  During the year, I had a rollover withdraw from a traditional IRA.  I entered the information from the 1099 form that showed an IRA distribution.  There was a message that I will later be asked if the distribution is a rollover.  That question never came.  TurboTax treated the withdraw as a taxable event and added in a 10% penalty.  It took me nearly an hour to figure out how to correct it and enter in the rollover information.Finally, I am a Real Estate Agent.  Therefore, I have business deductions.  When I attempt to enter Business Deductions, I get a message that business deductions are not supported and I need to upgrade to the Home and Business edition.  I ignored the message and was able to enter the information manually.  Tax Cut did not do this (at least in previous years).</review>

<review id="9573">We purchased this blender about 2 years ago, mainly based on price, simplicity of design and reviews from Amazon. After living with a high-maintenance Kitchen-Aid blender (all those little parts to clean!), The Oster seemed liked the answer to our blender dreams. Unfortunately after weekly use simply for smoothies, it quickly became apparent that this Oster was not like its formidable ancestors... The power is totally inadequate. Food constantly overwhelms the blade and any kind of blending totally stops. Close to its 2-year birthday, it gave up the will to live - following a weird grinding noise, smoke came from the base and then.... nothing. And now, here we are, searching for a new blender.</review>

<review id="9574">Let me begin by saying that I never thought I would ever write a negative review about Quicken, a product I have loved for years. I have been a Quicken user for 12+ years and upgrade my version every other year. I have always had great success with the product and have never ever considered switching to a competing product (MS Money, etc.). However, Quicken Deluxe 2009 made me want to hurl my laptop out the window. The software is extremely buggy. Adding accounts has been hit-or-miss depending on the financial institution (American Express, Fidelity, Vanguard, etc.) and downloading transactions has been very frustrating with less than a 20% success rate. I am appalled that Intuit would put a product like this out given their stellar record till the 2009 version.Verdict: If you are a current Quicken user thinking about upgrading, don't do it. If you are considering Quicken for the first time, buy the 2008 version, wait for the kinks to be fixed in the 2009 version or (I hate to say it) buy something else.</review>

<review id="9575">I think if a vendor is going to promise you a product then it needs to be the real thing. I received my Chi and when I opened it I knew it was a FAKE, having used a Chi before I now what the real thing looks like and what it is capable of doing.This was not it.I was very disappointed, being a first time buyer with Amazon Im afraid of buying any products with there vendors now because I don't know what Im going to get. And they where not very helpful with the return of the item. They don't even want the FAKE back!!!!</review>

<review id="9577">The good:(1) It's good looking! Some don't like that this shiny fusion finish is a fingerprint magnet, but I love it. I think this is one of the best looking laptops not produced by Apple.(2) It is reasonably priced. This statement can be applied to many Toshiba laptops. Except for some pricy models (like R500), Toshiba seems to set the prices at very competitive levels. Usually Toshiba laptops are much cheaper (conditional on the specs) than Sony, Lenovo, and more or less comparable (but often cheaper) than Dell and HP.(3) Decent keyboard, touchpad (synaptics), sound quality (average for a laptop), screen is shiny. 3 USBs, CD/DVD burner, Built in Camera, Bluetooth, Wirelss (not incl N). It is quiet, probably thanks for the P series processor.The bad:(1) I am worried about the touchpad button. I have been using the laptop only for two weeks, but the response of the right touchpad button (I am lefty so this is the left click button) is already getting less responsive. I used Dell and Lenovo in the past, and there was no problem in touchpad buttons after 4 years of use. I think that is not going to be the case with this laptop. Only for this reason, my next (or future) laptop will never be Toshiba.(2) Toshiba doesn't seems to support XP. I cannot find drivers for XP from Toshiba's webpage.(3) Recovery disk is really bad. I cannot choose which software to install when I implement a clean install. I tried to install without all the crapwares that Toshiba installed, but I cannot, because Recovery disk always recovers the laptop to its initial state (meaning thousands of craps which slow down or crush your PC). I hope Toshiba will include separate Vista disk or explain how to create an independent Vista disk. Also, because the recovery disk installs hundreds of craps, it takes really long time to recover...(4) Customer service is horrible. Toshiba does not seem to accept emails. It took forever (I tried for this review but gave up after 20 min of waiting) to connect to a customer service person.(5) This laptop is too new (using the latest Intel chipset) to be supported by Ubuntu or any major distro of Linux. For a while, you cannot use Linux nor XP, and thus stuck with Vista. Plus, Toshiba is not really famous for the support of Linux...(6) No fingerprint reader. Kind of not steady build (compared with Thinkpad so probably not fair). Battery sticks out; Toshiab cheats a bit with the "dimension" of the laptop. It's not as small as the official dimension suggests.The ugly: AmazonI placed an order on August 12th. No update until August 19th, and suddenly I received an email saying that they do not have it in stock and thus they cannot make delivery in line with the estimated schedule. Hopefully Amazon will handle my order MUCH better next time :(</review>

<review id="9580">For a young infant who isn't active, the SwaddleMe is a nice alternative to traditional receiving blankets.  However, if you have a wiggler, this item isn't going to help.  Our baby lasted in this swaddler for maybe three weeks until he figured out how to kick out of it.  Once he got his legs free, he'd wiggle around until the material was bunched up around his neck--not a very comforting sight.  So, we bought "The Amazing Miracle Blanket."  It was truly amazing--it's practically impossible for a young infant to even loosen the material let alone get out of it.  Baby started sleeping in the Miracle Blanket at 8 weeks and immediately was down for 7 to 8 hours at a stretch.  We finally had to put it up when, at 5 months, he no longer needed, or wanted, to be swaddled.  It's $29.99, but worth every penny. They have a website--www.miracleblanket.com.  Also, the SwaddleMe uses velcro, which is ridiculously loud when you're trying to quietly change baby in the middle of the night.</review>

<review id="9581">It is appalling to see that amazon is keeping such redundant items on its site.

<review id="9583">Buying this router was definitely the worst experience with a consumer product I've ever had.  I received it and hooked it up and it worked fine for basic internet connectivity.  But I really wanted a wireless connection I could use with my work laptop so I could use the VPN and connect to my office network.  The VPN would work fine ONLY IF I connected my laptop with a patch cable directly to the routed.  The VPN would not work wirelessly.  I spent HOURS on the phone with the "off-shore" difficult-to-understand, support technicians.  We tried SO MANY different configurations.  I downloaded the new firmware at least 3 times.  At one point, they said they would call me back the next day.  The ended up calling me at 1AM! I guess they didn't know how to convert to my time zone from India!  After about the forth time on the phone with them I finally said I was done. I didn't want to keep "experimenting" with them any longer.  I just wanted to return the router.  THEY WOULDN'T GIVE ME AN RMA!  I was furious.  I put their router in the trash can and bought a Belkin router.  WHAT a difference!  It worked out of the box, no issues, and about $50 cheaper.  Good bye Neatgear!!!I hope this review saves someone from the frustration I've had!</review>

<review id="9590">Office 2007 replaces all the menus & toolbars from previous versions of Office with "The Ribbon".The Ribbon is a highly non-intuitive gimic that forces you to throw out  your hard learned knowledge from previous versions and re-learn how to navigate the programs from scratch. You will waste hours punting around the Ribbon, trying to to figure out how to execute tasks you're used to doing in seconds.Worst of all, there is no way to configure Office 2007 to have the look/feel of Office 2003; you're stuck.Bottom line, Office 2007 is a disastrous product that has severely impacted my productivity.

<review id="9594">I was in the market recently for a new coffe maker because my 12-cup Barista from Starbucks was mishandled by a guest and broke. I read reviews on several makers and decided to try this one! The biggest complaint of mine is that the coffee cools down way too fast! I got spoiled by the Barista because my coffee would still be warm after several hours post brewing. This one cools down within a couple of hours. It supposed to be the "Sony" of Japenese coffee makers but I am not quite sure if that's a compliment or not(spy ware on the CDs). I am going to donate this to my church's rummage sale and hopefully someone else can use it.The lid is very, very difficult for me to open-I usually get a paper towel to assist with opening.  The top of the carafe does have notches but the lid is so thin it's hard to get a good grip if you have average sized hands for a woman. Also, it took me giving the lid a good look to see that the attachment for the lid needs to come off, pull off, in order for the coffee to drip into the pot-understand why some reviewers think that it drips all over the counter.  The lid does need to be lined up as well.I am not impressed at all and I am very disappointed in the quality of this product! I order from Amazon all the time and I read the reviews and have never been this disappointed in the product I received.  I went to Starbuck's and bought DeLonghi Thermal for $120-a little more than what I paid for this-noticed this model is on sale at Amazon now and understand why. I paid $105 with shipping and for just $20 more, I am much happier with the quality, ease of use, style etc.The Zojirushi instructions DO NOT go into detail at all about the little things that have to be done-the lid top, for one. The instructions are very vague.The Zojirushi is very tall-not a problem for me because my cabinets are 16" above my counter but the DeLonghi is around 1.5 to 2" shorter than this one.  The Zojirushi is cheap looking and just doesn't even look or perform like what I think it should for the price. Maybe if it was offered for around $45 to $50 it could be considered "OK" for the price. Trust me, spend the few more bucks and get the DeLonghi Thermal.Don't waste your money! Buy the DeLonghi or perhaps look at the Cuisinart that Williams-Sonoma has(the Cuisinart at Williams-Sonoma is different than any other model that the websites and stores carry.</review>

<review id="9600">When I bought this, I did not have much thought about this machine except just coffee itself. Now, having used this machine for 6 months, I found that I am throwing out so many plastic packages. So, I bought re-usable coffee filter, but it was just messy and the coffee was not that great. And all the convenience is gone. You might better use the normal brew coffee machine that use a single sheet filter.There is an another option of using K-cup pod maker, which I haven't tried. But then again, you have to go through making pods by yourself, which may not be an option for the poeple who just want convenience.Unless each k-cup is being made recyclable, wasting plastics for each cup of coffee is a wrong thing to do, especially when we have many ways of coffee making without hampering our environment. Besides, it doesn't make that great coffee, enough to justify damaging the environment.</review>

Ironically, the keyboard works fine under OS X when connected to the D-Link Hub.I guess I got what I paid for.  A piece of junk 7 port hub for under $30.

<review id="9605">Like most people, I was eagerly awaiting the first major update to Microsoft Office for Mac in four years and bought it right away.  I'm not a huge power-user, but this new release is so poor and so buggy I'm going back to my 2004 edition.  It's even slower than 2004 on my Intel Macs, Entourage doesn't alert me to new emails, all of my Excel macros are completely wasted, Toolbars may or may not appear, print settings don't save with documents.... and on and on and on.

<review id="9610">The product description was incomplete or misleading from this seller. The product that was ordered as advertised was Microsoft Office Professional 2007 FULL VERSION. The product recieved was the student version of the above product which can only be used on a home system and cannot be used in a office environment. I have emailed the seller with no resolve. By no means should this reflect on Amazon who I have done business with for many years and have only praise for.</review>

<review id="9611">It's "Buyer Beware!" time at Amazon.com. I bought a Braun electric razor from Amazon, and figured that buying cleaner cartridge refills at the same time would by a smart idea. Unfortunately, I clicked on the item from another vendor, "Presents4You", instead of Amazon.com. Did the "One-Click Ordering" thing, and when reviewing my order, noted that the cleaner would be shipped separately from the razor. "Hmmmm", I said, that wasn't very economical. Then came the big surprise. The cost of the cleaner was approx. $19. The cost of shipping and handling was $23 bucks! Yep, the dirty rats had emplaced an electronic pickpocket. I discovered that my only recourse for cancelling this attempt at online thievery was to send an email to the vendor, which I did within seconds of seeing this blatant scam. No response, but also no notice that the stuff was being shipped, so I figured that all was good. I also had ordered a supply of cleaner through Amazon.com...less than half the price, and it was shipped with my razor.  A week after my razor and cleaner arrived, I received a small package via UPS. To my disgust, it contained the unwanted cleaner cartridges...and of course, there was no invoice or return instructions. When my credit card statement showed up the following week, there was the charge for $43. I've attempted to file a claim through Amazon.com, but unlike the rest of their processes, which are user friendly and reliable, this particular process is difficult, and keeps getting rejected for "technical problems." The lesson for those of you who read this pitiful tale of woe? Be VERY careful when selecting accessories for your Braun 360 series razor! (By the way, the razor isn't as great as it was cracked up to be, but at least I paid a fair price for it!)</review>

<review id="9612">WTF?  Why would I want an Italian version keyboard shipped to Newport Beach, CA?  There is no where on this advertisement saying its selling an Italian version.  BUYER BEWARE.  I will update this review once I hear back from this company regarding returns.</review>

<review id="9613">It appears to be a good product for some and troublesome for others.  After reading the reviews I took a gamble hoping that it will work for me especially at the amazing price after rebates.  Unfortunately my WGR614 had a few of the problems that others were encountering.First, using Netgear WG511 pc card and router after the initial setup the connection lasted about 3 days before I had to do my first reboot of the device.  Following the next few days the connection wouldn't last from morning to evening without a reboot.  Second, after disabling SSID broadcast it would still broadcast the name.  Instead of waiting until it disconnects every hour on the hour like others have experienced I decided to return it.  While it was connected the performance was very good with 54mbps at times, so it stated on the configuration utility.  Haven't decided which router to go with next, most likely Linksys.</review>

<review id="9614">Shame on Cuisinart for putting on the market such a piece of junk.  I'm trying to learn to be civil, so I can't use a more appropriate four-letter word than 'junk'.There's an obvious manufacturing flaw that ineffectuated both of the machines I got from Bed, Bath & Beyond.  The funnel-shaped filter holder is spring-loaded at the bottom and requires pressure from above in order to drip.  However, once the water had dripped just a tiny bit, not enough pressure was exerted and the coffee machine stopped dripping!I called Cuisinart, which had me on hold for twenty minutes before sending me to a very, very rude CSR who fully exuded her boredom, impatience and supercilliousness towards me.  Then she simply said, "you gotta take it back to the store".  So I did, only to be given another one with THE EXACT SAME DEFECT.Thanks Cuisinart... for nothing!  I always thought you made aesthetically nice products BUT WHO CARES IF THEY DON'T WORK!</review>

<review id="9616">I bought this waffle iron a couple of weeks ago and I'm not very happy with it for the following reasons. It browns waffles very unevenly. It doesn't have a large enough reservoir for overflow so if you accidentally overfill the iron at all the batter ends up on the waffle maker and on the counter. The waffles tend to stick to the top part of the iron even though the iron is new and supposedly nonstick. I'm already looking for a new waffle iron and wish I had kept the receipt for this one.</review>

<review id="9621">This review is from: Breaking Dawn (The Twilight Saga, Book 4) (Audio CD)      I just think Stephanie Meyers ruined it.  I was so into the first 3 books, and the part that just blew it for me in the 4th was the creation of Renesmee.  SO unneccesary.  I began to get completley annoyed with everyone hovering over Bella, and the whole Jake character needed to go away and stay away the first time he ran off as a werewolf to Canada.  It just got to be pathetic, and the imprinting on Renesmee, and the way Charlie just almost instantaneously accepted Bella's transformation to the point of watching a Basketball game...I couldnt read anymore.  I didnt care anymore.  The first 3 were great, number 3 being a favorite, but now I dont know if I could recommend a reader investing so much time for such a great letdown.  I mean please...she even become the most model perfect Newborn....what makes that an interesting read?</review>

<review id="9623">I am an apple fan and enjoy using the macbook but I just cannot recommend this laptop at the moment to others based on what you are getting for your money.  If you are looking for the best bang for your buck, then you should unfortunately look elsewhere.  In the midst of economic trouble apple has decided to increase the cost of their new entry level aluminum macbooks by 20% over early 2008s models with marginal performance gains from the additional front side bus.Pros-new trackpad has cool factor (although buggy)-new graphic card has made this a decent gaming platform-design is smooth and polishedCons- Overall performance based on price has decreased.  Now instead of getting a 2.4Ghz dual core for $1300 you must shell out an additional $300 @ $1600 to acquire this performance. If you checkout macworld's benchmarks the performance gained over the additional FSB is marginal at best.  The only gains come in frames per second during game testing.- graphics card is nice but most ppl are not even into hardcore computer gaming and the macbook use to be a nice alternative to the pro models hefty price tag for us non gamers....wish this could have been an option.-160GB or 250GB hard drive with only 5400rps!  At these price points I expected at the minimum 7200rps.  I know this can be manually changed, but who wants to shell even more money after buy such an expensive laptop.Overall this computer performs well but the price is even becoming to high for some of us apple fans.  The macbooks have always been a top of the line luxury laptop but now they are widening that gap even further with design not performance fueling the price increases.  My recommendation is to wait at this time b/c come mid 2009 the prices will hopefully fall and Apple's new and improved SnowLeopard OS will be out.  With Steve Jobs you never buy the first iteration of a new product, unless you are willing to pay top dollar for something that will decrease in price by 20% in 6months.</review>

<review id="9625">I bought this coffeemaker in June 04. It worked consistently until May 05 when suddenly it fried (it had just finished brewing and was keeping a pot of coffee warm). Aside from the fact that it didn't last more than a year (my last coffeemaker lasted 5+) I would not buy this coffeemaker again.First of all, pouring the water in is *very* tricky--instead of being large and in front, you have to aim in the back right, in a tiny hole. It's also hard to see where it's supposed to go because it's all black. I seriously had to pull it out and turn it every day in order to fill it with water; even still I spilled sometimes.  The lid on the carafe does not have any clasp to keep it on--it falls off if you don't hold on to it when pouring, and if it's not on *perfectly* when you brew, coffee spills all over. Of course, over time the lid gets more and more warped from the steam, so it becomes harder to get it to stay on.The stainless steel never looked clean, no matter how often I worked on it. I think this had to do with the steam always condensing on the sides. Finally, the coffee doesn't taste substantially better than any other coffeemakers I've tried. Good beans and fresh grinding matter more.</review>

<review id="9626">This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series (DVD)      When it first came out, I was completely thrilled to buy it.  Got it home and it wasn't captioned.  Being hard of hearing, this is a big problem.  Frankly, I couldn't believe that the BBC (purchased through Discovery Channel) would release something without captioning.  I went to Discovery Channel's site and complained about it on a post -- and would you believe they never posted my comment?  Completely file 13'd it.  No reply ... nothing.So that's why they get a bad review a year later.  I don't trust Discovery Channel now.</review>

<review id="9627">This product gave me an allergy, I felt like I was going to die or something, I get nightmares just thinking about it. It seems that 0.5% of the population is susceptible to soy allergies and I happen to be one of them. Anyway, this product is not completely whey like the company claims, in fact it has cheap soy added to it. If you will look at the allergen information, it says that soy lecithin is been added to improve mixability. I feel like I have been cheated, if I was living in the United States then I would have sued optimum for sure. People get your facts straight, whey is imported into United States from Newzealand and Australia. If you check any Newzealand or Australian sites you will know that Whey isolate is very very expensive. It is impossible to sell 10 pounds of this stuff at $60(even if it was a mix of whey concentrate-a cheaper version of whey) If some of you consider suing Optimum, please remember me and send me check as well :-) Right now I don't take anything manufactured by so called "bodybuilding product" companies. Remember in 2005 another company Ultimate Nutrition was sued for Super Complete capsules by some Swimmer and had an out of court settlement for half a million dollars.</review>

<review id="9628">I have been taking this product for a month now and it has done absolutely nothing, with regard to weight loss. I have been losing my usual two pounds per week, but that is due to an exercise regiment. This product does not even suppress my appetite. I must say I am very disappointed, especially after reading some of the reviews from others, on this and other sites.Do yourself a favor and don't buy. Another alternative is to buy it with five of your friends and all of you try it. If you notice a change, then by all means, purchase more. If you don't notice anything you will have minimized your loss.</review>

<review id="9629">I bought this to replace my Braun blender, which died after a mere two years of use. Despite the outstanding reviews the Oster received, I would not recommend it. Yes, it is strong - too strong. If you put more than 1 cup of liquid in there, it goes all over the kitchen - and that is despite forcefully holding down the lid during the blending process. Blending a huge pot of soup one cup at a time is not fun.On the other hand, it did an outstanding job with pesto - better than the Braun. On pulse, it does a nice job of sucking everything down into the blades. I don't have to constantly stop and stir. Unfortunately, I make soup far more often than I make pesto. So while I will not be getting rid of this until it dies, I will be cleaning up my kitchen far more than I had anticipated.</review>

<review id="9630">I was, and remain, a very big fan of the Twilight series-at least the first three books.  The author has created a universe populated with fascinating, compelling,and relatable characters.  However, this very fact has made it very hard for me to accept that Breaking Dawn is how the series has been concluded.  I wish the series had concluded after the third book.  This last installment certainly provided the happy ending we had wished for,...but the way it went about it was so strange that it's very hard to believe it was written by the same author.     Almost all of the characters felt "off".  They generally behaved in uncharacteristic ways, and suddenly began entirely new behaviors which were rather odd(why the sudden nicknames?, for example).  There were what I perceived as many contradictions with earlier books. The most notable to me is that the author seemed to make it quite clear in earlier books that a "normal" life and a family are something Bella is sacrificing to be with Edward.  Yes, I do understand an explanation was provided(surprise!  guess vamps can get humans pregnant.)...it's just that the explanation wasn't really sufficient to support such a radical plot development, in my opinion.  Then, there is Bella's extreme aversion to blood. It suddenly is no problem,with no explanation given?   My primary reason for not liking the book can be traced to the radical shift in writing style.   The fact that the book seemed to be veering suddenly into science fiction type territory, complete with mutant children which grow at a super accelerated rate.(and on that subject, I simply don't understand...why?  Neither parent,nor anyone in the bloodlines, grew or grows at a super fast pace, why would the offspring?) Once Bella discovered she was pregnant,the book really did seem to jump the shark. The characters which were so compelling suddenly seemed abstract strangers.    I read it, twice, and while I did find many moments of humor and even moments, though few, which made me recall the glory of the former books...overall, when I finished, I was left talking to myself, saying "what did I just read? Was that really the book I've been awaiting for a long time?"    I realize that a book which was so heavily anticipated would not be able to please everyone...it was bound to be a let-down to some people.  But when the people who are terribly disappointed are some of the most devoted of fans, then I think perhaps something went wrong.  I never would have imagined I'd be writing a negative review for this book. I never could have imagined the book being such a departure from the series.  And I certainly never imagined that I'd now choose to imagine the series ended with Eclipse.</review>

<review id="9631">Do not buy this CHI product!!  I have purchased two CHI irons and both have malfunctioned in a very short period of time; one within 4 months of purchase.  The company WILL NOT honor the one year warranty unless you buy it from an "authorized" dealer.  If you buy it from anyone on the internet, they will not honor the warranty.  I believe that these are expensive products that are very cheaply made, which is why they malfunction so quickly.  Do yourself a big favor, and find a better brand of straightening iron to purchase.  I will never purchase another CHI product because of their poor customer service and tendency to break within just a few months!!</review>

<review id="9632">Subtle messages about gay lifestyle and issues are sprinkled all through this movie. Rent it first before deciding to buy it. Before reading further please note that there are major spoilers because I have to divulge details about the movie to make my point.The movie doesn't come out and say that Alex, the lion is gay. Instead the opening scene is about how Alex's father is trying to teach baby Alex to fight lion-like and Alex is seen showing more interest in twirling and dancing. Yeah we get it. gays are born different, they don't choose to be gay..Later when Alex mistakes the rite-of-passage as a dance competition instead of fighting another lion, Alex's father is clearly disappointed and says , "I though you were a lion" and Alex is crushed on hearing his dad say this. This can be easily interpreted to show how parents react when they find out that their son is gay.Later, the monkeys are negotiating with the Penguin about worker rights and they demand maternity leave. The penguin looks under the table, confirms that the monkeys are all male and ask, "why do you need maternity leave ? you are all boys". These kind of complex subjects don't belong in a kids movie.I wish someone had warned me about this vehicle for gay rights. I would not have bought it. I wish kids movie would get back the age of innocence in which they are not exposed to propaganda from special interest groups.</review>

<review id="9633">I ordered this and tried to have a 15 day free trial installed to see if it worked and how well it worked. I wish I had tried the free install before I ordered it. I still haven't received the package yet but now know I want nothing to do with it or Norton. It would not install from the free download from Norton's site. It gave me an error after about 30 to 40 minutes of grinding. It took me to an error message with a link from Norton telling me to install a Microsoft package VISUAL C ++ 2005. I tried, it failed to install. I tried about three more times. searched the net for answers. none to be found. After about four or five hours of this, I contacted Norton support group for help. After a wait of about half an hour, I had someone start a conversation with me and he asked to be given a minute to "REVIEW" my problem. He left me for about another half an hour and the screen said he left the room. I waited, waited and another guy comes on and starts to troubleshoot with me. After about an hour, during which he is helping other people by asking me to excuse him for a moment, he gets the same error messages. He says "CONTACT MICROSOFT, It's their problem". If you have ever tried to contact Microsoft you realize how this came across to me. I have lost about 6 hours now and still have no solution except to cancel my order from Amazon. Norton just wants money, they could care less about people with problems. Stay away from all Norton products, there is no support.</review>

<review id="9635">As a recent PC-MAC convert, I obtained office 2008 hoping it would take care of the calculations on my crazy excel spreadsheets.  I found the calculations occurred much faster when I bootcamped XP into my macbook, installed office 2007, and ran them there.  I also hate not being able to dock the formula bar and because I regularly use just about all of the features in the "ribbon" in 2007, it was painful not seeing them all there (and summoning them resulted in the spreadsheet view being obstructed).  This doesn't seem to bother a lot of mac users and it's possible that I'm miffed because I already took a lot of time to learn how to use the MS 2007 ribbon only to not find it where I hoped it would be.  PC --> Mac converts, just beware, especially if you need a fast, reliable system in MS office.  I keep it around to do light office work so I don't have to bootcamp out of leopard every time I want to open something in word.</review>

<review id="9636">This show was one of television's stars a few seasons ago.  Unfortunately, the plots have descended into trivial shells of stories told on earlier seasons.

<review id="9637">I'm cloth diapering my third child and was excited to finally try this environmentally sound disposable diaper for those few times when disposables are necessary.  Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed with these diapers.  The tabs fell off when I was putting them on my son, the tabs came undone once on him, they leaked repeatedly, the absorbent material inside would wad up to one side, and they left my son's bottom feeling wet and clammy.  He actually got diaper rash almost every time he wore these for a whole day.  (Keep in mind that I'm used to cloth diapers so I change his diaper when wet, approx. every 2 hours.)  Overall, based on the case of diapers I bought, size 6, these diapers are very poor quality and do not work well at all.  They are definately not worth the premium I paid.</review>

<review id="9639">I've used TurboTax for a couple of years and took it for granted that this years edition was like all of the previous versions (including both Federal AND State).  Unfortunately, I got stuck with the initial version of TurboTax before all of the negative one-star reviews forced Intuit to add State back.  Once I completed Federal, I couldn't believe TT was squeezing me for another $30 for state + $20 for filing.  In my opinion, Intuit probably knew this was going to catch quite a few people off guard but did so anyways as a way to increase the price somewhat underhandedly.  As it turns out, it's a fairly stupid way to offend your best customers.  I'll be trying out other options next year.</review>

<review id="9641">I've been shaving my body hair for years using a traditional hair trimmer.  I was excited to see a product that was specifically designed for this purpose and it seemed like it'd be easy to use - and I liked that it was cordless.  Once it was charged up I found that it couldn't trim my body hair well with any of the supplied attachments - and I'm not even very hairy.  I'd have to go over the same spot again and again to get all the hairs to the same length.  It did a fine job when I wanted an area shaved bald - not as close as a blade shaver but good enough.  Unfortunately, except for certain sensitive areas, mostly I like my body hair clipped rather than shaved.  For this I still need to go back to the old hair clipper.Bummed since I really wanted this product to work for everything.</review>

<review id="9643">We've had this coffee maker for about 8 months, got it because a) cuisinart has a solid reputation, and b) we wanted a machine with simple, no bell-and-whistles operation.  It does look really nice, very functional, but in reality, the filter and the water inlet are way too close together and the top doesn't come off for cleaning, making the whole thing a fairly messy machine. You wind up with coffee grounds all over the place. I can deal with that, but now, over the last week it has developed a serious leak. About half the water comes out the  bottom of the machine, burning hot, So if you want 5 cups of coffee, you've got to put in 10 cups of water, and you get five cups of boiling water all over the counter. It's not worth repairing, the repair would be as much as the machine, so I'm tossing it and replacing with another brand of coffee maker (Technivorm Moccamaster) that is more expensive but doesn't sound like it'll have the issues the cuisinart does.</review>

<review id="9645">If I could give it 0 star, I will, because I don't see the product.Amazon was using my old address as the default shipping address, and I missed to correct it, so the package was shipped to the old address. I found it after they shipped the package, but before the delivery. However I can't reroute the shipping unless UPS failed to deliver. Unfortunately UPS dropped the package at the old address without my signature: with somebody else's signature there or without signature. Therefore, it is shown that the package was delivered successfully for me, although I have never received anything. Hope amazon got a way to handle this kind of thing.</review>

<review id="9646">I just returned it.  Because the ceramic plates do not wrap all the way around, your hair gets easily snagged.

<review id="9648">After reading the numerous glowing reviews of this product I decided it would be a good purchase for my home and dog. Repeated  attempts to locate the perimeter were fruitless. Invaribly I would be able get a signal and locate the perimeter, but moving over a few feet I would receive no signal whatsoever. After a week of futility I gave up. For a perimeter fence it was absolutely worthless.One little item that I discovered is that if you have on older (pre 1960's) home, as I do, the unit's signals may be blocked by metal lath in the walls as well as lead based paint.Folllowing my experience I can only suggest the in-ground system unless you live in a newer home.</review>

I'll just skip all of that now.There was one favorable review, but that didn't strike me as being a real review.

<review id="9654">Quicken really needs to acknowledge that they are renting this software to you for 3 years; you aren't buying anything that will work beyond that.  They sunset their software every three years, crippling it to force you to upgrade to a newer version.  I can understand not releasing patches, and not supporting a product, but there's no reason to disable features that are working just fine.  I really wish Quicken would just be upfront, bill this as a subscription service, and charge us $20 a year.  I don't really want to take the hit to migrate over to another solution for financial tracking, but if you can avoid getting tangled up in their web, avoid this product, unless you don't mind being forced to shell out more money every 3 years.</review>

<review id="9655">I was at Bed, Bath & Beyond researching these coffee machines to replace my Starbucks Barista one cup/mug coffee maker (that thing makes a mess!).  Anyway, there was someone demonstrating the Keurig.  She showed me how it worked and made me a cup of coffee.  I chose one of those non-popular brands (pumpkin spice), took a sip and wanted to throw it up.  It tasted like cheap, truck-stop coffee!Next to her display area was the Tassimo by Bosch (the newer model).  I've already done my homework on this machine and knew that it was the better of the two.  Tassimo makes great coffee and more popular brands unlike what Keurig has to offer.  I also think that the K pods are clunky with way too much plastic for our landfills.  Tassimo made more sense to me.  I also like the fact that the Tassimo has a built-in water filter system that tells you when you're low in water.  Keurig doesn't have that.  All they have is over 130 unpopular coffee brands.  Bosch did a great job with their Research & Development (R&D) to re-create this machine.  The Braun version of this machine had a lot of problems but Bosch corrected them with this new machine.  So, go out and get yourself a Tassimo and don't get the Keurig.</review>

<review id="9656">I went through two of these units. I set up the first one and it worked for about a month. It then failed and no amount of tech support would revive it, so I had it replaced under warranty. The second unit worked a while, but soon after the warranty period expired, it started to flake out frequently.After that, I had a lot of problems with it. The wireless connection dropped often. Tech support could usually get it going again, and eventually I learned some of the tricks they gave me for resuscitating it: ipconfig through the command window, changing the wireless channel, etc. I had it for well over a year and it flaked out on me often. Even when it worked, its range didn't impress me. I couldn't move one room away from the router and maintain the wireless connection through a single wall at a distance of around 30 feet. Linksys tech support isn't too bad, and they tried to help, but the product is just dismal.Over time the rate of problems increased. I noticed that any time my laptop detected multiple wireless signals, my wireless connection would fail. I thought this might be a problem with the laptop, but we also have a PDA with wireless capability, and the Linksys wireless connection would drop the PDA at the same times.Eventually when I tried to update the firmware, my computer crashed, and the router went completely dead. It didn't even work as a physical router after that.Later a friend gave me a Linksys Compact Wireless-G router that had the very same problem with its wireless signal dropping whenever there were other wireless signals in the area. Changing channels and settings did nothing to help the problem. It only worked when I gave it to my parents, who live in a remote area where no other wireless signals can interfere with the Linksys wireless.Recently I tried to revive this older WRT54G model again by restoring the factory defaults and then updating the firmware. It  still doesn't work. This last problem may not be the fault of Linksys; they do warn that if the computer stops during a firmware update, the router may die. But the wireless never worked well, and that is the fault of Linksys. I've given Linksys plenty of chances but it has been a disappointment every time. If you live in an apartment building or in a dense neighborhood, avoid Linksys, or prepare to have big problems with your wireless connection as soon as one of your neighbors turns on a wireless device of his own.</review>

<review id="9657">These worked great for me. My cats both took to the crystals immediately and I did find the cartridge idea good in theory  - it was very easy to swap them out and throw the old ones away. I had 3 major problems, however, and ended up buying the "forever litter box" (a pvc refillable tray) from eBay. The problems I had were:- too expensive. I have 2 cats and each cartridge only lasted 7 days at best. I think the company needs to revise its packaging. I have yet to see one reviewer that got the full 30 days (or 15 days with 2 cats) as promised.- leaking: since i put the lid underneath, i never had anything leak all the way through, but the first layer of cardboard was definitely wet each time I changed the cartridge- smell. By the 6th or 7th day, i could really smell the box. I live in a very small loft, so the smell is a big issue. I am not sure if it was the crystals or the wet box, but either way it was a problem.So now, with the "forever box' I no longer have the convenience of throwing away the whole box, but at least I don't have the expense either.</review>

<review id="9658">You could not beat the price. It is about 15 cents per diaper. I did some research. The best price for Huggies and Pampers is around 20 cents. The fit is nice. We do not have leak problems. However I do not feel comfortable about the scent. The inside of the diaper looks cheap too. My baby has sensitive skin. After I tried a couple LUV diapers, he had bad rash. I stopped using it immediately. But the rash is still there now.</review>

<review id="9659">There are at least 20 customer reviews in this group going on at length about Intuit's pricing changes and complete disregard for its customer base. I agree wholeheartedly with all of them so I won't repeat them in mine. They bring to mind Intuit's attempt to prevent a user from installing TurboTax on more than one computer several years ago so you couldn't print from different printers. They quickly backed down from that stance and apologized. Will we see the same behavior here? I'm skeptical, but in this year of deep recession, the last thing Intuit should be doing is poking its valued users in the eye.I do have another complaint that has not really been explored before. As a retired CPA, I liked being able to go directly to the forms and choose how I wanted to prepare a return. In this year's version, that option has become quite challenging. Closing a form seems impossible when you're finished and poking around in a simple return was just frustrating. We're only in early December!After 20 years as well, this is the Waterloo for TurboTax and me.</review>

<review id="9660">Product worked just fine for 2 yrs and then one fine day the wireless gave out (wired router function still worked). Tried to call tech support - was on hold for 2.5hrs before giving up. They do not tell wait times during hold and I did not want to wait to infinity. Tried live tech chat and got no response for over 1hr. Gave up.This company had great support about a yr+ back. I remember taking to svc reps in under 10mins during 1st year of use. Guess they don't think people care about support - wrong!</review>

<review id="9663">I purchased a WGR614v2, and for about 2 weeks it continually had intermittent problems. In many tests, I finally narrowed it down to it's inability to handle large amounts of file transfers/packets. I upgraded the firmware, and the problem still persisted. I opened up a trouble ticket with Netgear and they advised me that the router was defected and to return it for a replacement. I went back to CompUSA, and received a replacement (no problem from CompUSA). This time I received a WGR614v3.The same exact problem persists with this new router. After another 2 hours with tech support from Netgear, they advised me to return this one and to try again! Infact, they even advised me to get a WGR614v2 instead of a WGR614v3! I'm afraid not! 2 routers out of 2 are defective! That doesn't say much for their QC or their products in general. To emphasis that it IS their router(s) that are defective, I can connect to neighbors APs (Linksys and Actiontec) with no problem what-so-ever! It is only when I connect to a NetGear AP, that this problem exist.</review>

<review id="9664">I ordered this hoping all the rave reviews would be my experience vs. the really negative reviews.  I was wrong.  I believe this little device could do all it claims if it can ever be configured properly.  User documentation is a joke and LinkSys HelpLESS desk is not much better.  Was attempting to connect this router to my ISP's router which some reviewers had success in doing with cross over cables and static ip's.  Unfortunately I wasn't one of them.  3 days lost messing with this and Linksys tech support was really weak.  I knew more than they did about their product.  To quote one 'tech' &quot;I'm confused&quot;...duh!  I'm convinced all the calls went to some outsourcer in India to boot so getting through was an ordeal in itself.If you have a very simple setup and don't care too much about security you may be very happy with this.  I can only reason that all the rave reviews by first time non-tekkie users is based on not needing alot of functionality and using device defaults.  But if you need anything more YOU need to know what you are doing because help is non-existant.  I'm sure this could be a great addition to a home network but it will take someone savvier than me to get it to work.  Good luck if you decide to go ahead with this product!</review>

<review id="9665">I chose this Netgear product over other brands simply because in the past, Netgear products have always worked flawlessly. Nowadays however, Netgear's routers seem to be degrading in quality and the WGR614 is no exception. I recently purchased a version 5 and while it is good for basic routing, any complex addition to a network will cause this router to malfunction (e.g. adding a network printer).I've talked to tech support over 2 days and the only solution they can give me is that my network printer is at fault however as soon as I tried using a Linksys WRT54G, my network works as expected.If all you need is to route a couple computers together with no extra features, this product should suffice. Otherwise, look elsewhere, especially the Linksys products.</review>

<review id="9666">This review is from: Australia (Video On Demand)      I had good expectations from this movie considering the cast included two big names and subject is quite a likable country. Unfortunately the result was less than expected. Actors delivered mediocre performance, story was very thin at best but worst of all was the direction of the movie. The director's clear intention to make an OZ version of "Gone with the wind" ended up being a bad publicity for people who were involved in the movie. For its credit some shots and special effects were quite good but wasn't enough to help the end result. This could have been a movie to brand a country (not sure how much Australia needs branding). As much as I dislike big budget Hollywood productions, after seen this non-Hollywood big shot movie, I felt for the first time they (Hollywood)seem to be doing better job in these types of projects.Sort of the story, this movie is really not worth spending close to three hours in front on the screen.</review>

<review id="9667">I purchased this product a litte over a month ago. After it got here, I carefully measured my 10 step walking distance as they instruct you to do. Once I programmed my pedometer to my standards, I began using it. It worked great when I first got it. I would walk 10 steps and it would count 10 (sometimes 11 or so) steps. Overall, it was a good product for a while.Throughout the first week I would test it to see if it was still accurate. To my delight, it did remained accurate. I recommened it to some family and then they purchaced some. It wasn't until I helped one of them set up theirs that I realized how much of a piece of junk this thing is (at least ours). I carefully helped one of my family members measure their stride and then set up the pedometer. When she tried it out, it was very innacurate. We spent more time trying to accuartely measure the correct walking pace. Afterwards we tried again. Still, it was innaccurate. I then was curious and checked mine to see if it was working; it was not. If I were to walk 10 steps, it would count 17. If I were to walk 5-6 steps, it would usually count 0 steps and sometims maybe 12-13. The same was happening with my family members. The product would either count too much, or not count at all. I called the Omron number and asked what we should do. She recommened we reset the pedometer and reprogram it. We did. Still, the thing was messing up. Then we remeasured our walking pace and repgrogrammed it again. Still, nothing. Overall we spent about 2 hours trying to get the things to work. I don't know if our products were defects or if the product itself just doesn't work. However, I do NOT RECOMMEND this product based on my personal experience.Final thought: This product does not work. Some may work; others may not. If you want to take a gamble, go ahead and buy it. If you want to save yourself the effort, look elsewhere.</review>

<review id="9670">Saw these all online and TV. Worth owning if you're a psycho-fan, but this season is seriously lacking in the story department. It's like Matt and Trey thought up "10-minutes-of-funny" for each episode and then stretched it out to meet the 22-minute requirement. Not their best work. Not trying to slam them, but definitely VERY dissapointed with this season. Been a fan for a decade, and this is NOT "MUST OWN" material. If you had to buy a few, grab seasons 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Those are my favorites. I will be waiting for this one to significantly drop in price before I complete my collection. I do love this show, just not this box set.</review>

<review id="9672">I bought this after seeing one at my daughter's house.Since she swore by it, I bought one.  I have to say - the coffee indeed tastes great.When you want an above average tasting coffee, it is for you.However, I really don't think my B60 is worth the going price.About half that would seem more appropriate.  Just my opinionfor what it is worth.  Furthermore, mine does not seem to makea constently-sized cup of coffee.  During each session, the second cup most always is not as full as the first one, despite the fact that I choose the same size for both.

<review id="9674">This beautiful bit of design installed nicely, worked for a whole six weeks, and now fails to connect with *one* of my email providers.  I've reinstalled the software, re-upped the firmware, rebooted the router, modem and computer multiple times, and spent hours searching forums and in lovely online chats with Linksys Live Advisors.  My gears are stripped, my tires are blown, and I'm now using it as a paperweight.  My computer wired stright to the modem works fine, so it's not in my email application, ISP, email srever, virus checker, firewall or in the stars.  Maybe it will work for you, but do yourself a favor and read the one- and two-star ratings on Amazon and check the email threads on Linksys forums before you click 'Add to Cart'.PO'd in Parksville</review>

<review id="9676">I have been seaching for a good gamepad to use for emulators and other games on my PC for some time now and have found that while there are many great gamepads being made for Playstation 2, X-Box, and other consoles, there are few good PC gamepads worth buying.  While there were some positive aspects to this controller, the problems I have had with the other gamepads in the past were evident in this product as well:  1)The buttons were much too close together, resulting in accidental pushes of random buttons;  2)The analog sticks were very loose, without the resistance I was used to in other gamepads (ie. X-Box, PS2);  3)The shoulder/trigger buttons (L & R) were huge, with only one on each side rather than two as most gamepads have now;  4)There was no "start" or "select" button in the center.  These functions could be programmed onto other buttons, but this was confusing and difficult to remember;  5)The D-pad (the directional buttons shaped like a plus sign), essential for many games created for older cartridge consoles (ie. SNES, NES, Sega...), was very akward and imprecise.  Pushes on the horizontal parts of the D-pad were often interpreted as up or down;  6)Finally, the controller just felt cheaply made, as if it would break easily if dropped.  The buttons clicked loudly (I prefer a quiet gamepad) and did not feel smooth to push.While this controller could probably have sufficed, I was looking for much more from a $30 controller.  In the end I returned this product and purchased on Ebay an adapter that allows you to hook a Playstation (or PS2) controller into a USB port and found some original Playstation controllers for very cheap since few people use those any more.  Also this adapter allows me to plug two controllers into one USB port for easy multiplay.  This has worked flawlessly and ended up being much cheaper (I believe the adapter was about $8 and the PS controllers were given to me by a friend).  This is the method I would recommend.  I hope this helps frustrated people like me who have so far been disappointed with PC controllers.</review>

<review id="9679">I originally reviewed this product earlier in the summer and was a little turned off by it at the time.  In the meantime, the company contacted me and offered me a replacement as well as a trial of the new one-handed model.   After accepting the offer they arrived the next day, it's almost like they drove them to my house, I was impressed.   The replacement was much much better and 100% effective.  The new one-handed model works equally as well.   I have to say, these guys went above and beyond and had an impressive level of commitment to customer satisfaction.   I would, without a doubt, recommend this product to anyone looking to get away from the expensive battery devouring skin biting electric models made by the other guys.   Plus these guys are trying real hard to make a good American product with quality and caring customer support.Thanks Groommate and keep up the good work.HenryPS - I would have changed the start rating but Amazon doesn't allow it.

<review id="9685">I've only had this Eee901 for a four days and I absolutely adore it.  Amazing size, speed, battery life. But she's breaking my heart.  The partitioned drive setup and the way the pc comes pre-installed means that I get low disk space warnings all the time...doing mundane things like reading mail or writing this review.  I've uninstalled lots of the programs that came preinstalled but this C drive is just too darn small.  This is my only pc and perfect for my needs. I don't run alot of programs or store files so I didn't expect the space to be an issue.  Forget trying to stream a video.  I don't know if the Eee 1000 solves this problem, but I have real buyer's remorse right now, especially because everything else about this Eee is great.  I'm waiting for Tech Support to respond to my questions about how to repartition or some other solution.</review>

<review id="9688">I brought mine home yesterday and it was never recognized by any PC and the light was solid only once. Now the light flashes briefly once plugged in and never returns. I can hear something running in it, but the drive won't come up. I called tech support, and, after giving them my name, phone number, address, email address, and the serial number of the product, he initially told me it cannot be plugged into a power strip and needs to be plugged directly into the wall. As if this is possible with most computers needing at least two plugs (more if you count printers, scanners, speakers, etc.) With his permission, I wrangled an extension cord and tried it again with no luck. He then had me test a different USB cable and then asked for me to connect the firewire cable. My computer does not have firewire. He said I have a defective unit and to return it.Disappointing, since I have used smaller versions with no issues. This one goes back to Costco.</review>

<review id="9689">I bought the 500 GB My Book at Best Buy for $99 and expected it to perform like my older IO Gear external drive. I was horribly disappointed. While Vista recognized the drive immediately, it took over an hour to copy a 10 GB folder using a USB 2 connection. That's simply unacceptable. I should have checked the other reviews here and at Cnet to see how bad this drive is. I have had several WD drives in computers over the years and never expected them to produce a product that would perform so poorly. My advice would be to pay a little more for another drive.Update 8/13/2008:I plugged the drive into an XP machine and it worked fine. The speed problem seems to be isolated to my laptop with Vista Premium. My drive is version 2.0. When other reviewers say, "I can't understand the bad reviews" it points out how inconsistent the quality is with this product. I certainly can understand the bad reviews.</review>

<review id="9690">I've owned the x45 HOTAS for almost a year since I decided to finally try the x52.  Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with the x45, I just got a little curious about the x45's older brother.Here are my observations comparing the two HOTAS: x45 vs. x52* x45 - Buttons/Hats were a little hard to reach with smaller hands on the stick, but I actually prefer the rocker switch for rudder control located on the throttle.  I only wish it was designed better and more ergonomically.  It felt weird for me to pull on the stick on the x52 and have to rotate the it for rudder control as more often than not I find myself rotating the stick inadvertently.  Stability sucks while playing games, it's just not heavy/stable enough to keep from tipping often.  SOLUTION: I've fabricated a bracket out of wood and steel to solve this.  Solid as a rock on my chair or desk!  Heavy as a rock though... =0(* x52 - Buttons/Hats are easier to reach on the stick, but having the rudder twist on the stick is a drawback for me.  I'd rather use the rocker on the throttle or rudder pedals.  More available modes are nice, but I've honestly never run out of buttons on the x45.  Stability sucks while playing games, it's just not heavy/stable enough to keep from tipping over.  Fabricating a bracket to mount on would solve this.  The x52 just feels much bigger than the x45.  It's a little uncomfortable moving the stick around because of its size, but the huge deadzone in the stick seems to be the biggest drawback for me.  Can't seem to solve it with software either...Unfortunately, I will be returning the x52 after only a few weeks of use and going back to my trusty x45.  It looks cooler than the x45, feels better, but functionality has not been improved for me.  Biggest drawbacks of the x52 are as follows (in order of importance):1) Huge deadzone that can't be compromised with software.  My x45 doesn't exhibit this flaw.2) Rudder twist on the stick rather than a rocker switch.  I would have preferred that they improved upon the x45's rocker switch on the throttle on the x52.3) The HOTAS just "seems" much bigger when I'm playing.  It's a little uncomfortable how tall the stick is and how much I have to throw it around for fast game playing.Anyways, my $0.02.  Have fun with whatever HOTAS you end up going with.  I happen to love the fact that I paid $64.98 for my x45 on amazon, less than half what I paid for the x52.  In my case, the x45 is simply a much better buy for what I got.  But whatever the case, go test drive first.  See what works for you!  Just make sure you can return either for a refund.</review>

<review id="9691">I really like  this keyb. It is absolutely fancy, mmatch my PC coolors and add a soome style to my desk.Hoow dooes it works? Not that goood IMO. Great when gaming, but so far horrible typing a docuument.II come from a very standard keyb, one of those for 10 bucks att any store, and typing docs and email i never had typo issues. Noisy clicks, mayybe yes, not fanncyy look, ok.. for 10 bucks, but no typo mistakes whatsoever.The Reclusa, looks nice, has a soft keyb, not too noisy, but for me is a nightmare to type on. mayybe tooo sensitiive, but thhere is no way to really fix thhe problem. I already set evverything I could at low sensitivity. Ok I''ll show you  what I mean:-- Starting now, I am typing  withhout fix alll the typo errors gennerated by thhe kkeyboard. As you can see, it''s a  nightmare. of course iit possibble it s mme, althou withh my old keybb iit never hhappened and at mmyy office i have no issues wiithh a bbasic DDELLL kkeybb. ----So, now you have an idea. I am tryinng to get used to it. Writiing a documents takes ages now and I am not happy for this.

<review id="9692">I strongly recommend  that anyone who intends to use this mixer to knead dough  purchase a different brand!  I owned  a KitchenAid mixer for 16 years . During that time , I usually baked bread at least once a week. In recent years I often baked 2 batches of bread a week. ( I have 4 children) My old mixer was reliable and a real workhorse. Last year, when it finally died, we decided to upgrade to the " Professional model" since it has a more powerful motor and supposedly could handle 14 cups of flour. Big mistake!!! Despite following all the instructions ( such as never kneading dough above a speed 2. Also I never kneaded more than 12 cups of flour!), it seemed as if the motor was straining right from the start. Yesterday, while kneading 8 cups of flour it just stopped! What really irritates me is that I haven't done much breadmaking in the last few months. If I had done my normal amount of breadmaking it probably would have died during the warranty period, which expired 3 months ago! ( no wonder they only give a 1 year warranty!) We haven't taken this machine apart but I suppose the plastic gearbox I've read about in the other negative reviews struck again. KitchenAid is clearly living on its reputation!</review>

<review id="9693">I bought this unit from Sharper Image because their description led me to believe that it would be better than traditional flossing.  The product manual, however, instructs that the oral irrigator should be used in conjunction with flossing, which seems redundant.  I went to using it regularly, but after a few weeks I felt that my teeth were not as clean as they were with floss, and after flossing I found a good deal of build-up.  Maybe I wasn't using it properly, since it seems that a lot of people give this unit high marks, but I just didn't find it helpful.  Try the Reach Access Daily Flosser, which I found is much more effective.</review>

<review id="9695">I have had an older Netgear router (G) and have had long-term experiences with intermittent dropped connections and required modem resettings.  The range was ok for my house, but not exceptional.  I saw all the advertising for the new "N" routers and so decided to buy the 160N.  Generally, the router has nothing to recommend it.-Set up was not smooth.  Instructions were not tailored for DSL, so I had to research this on the internet. -After changing routers, I immediately had significantly more lost connections.  -I checked speeds with both G and N notebooks and found the 160N generally to be slower.-I also lost my ability to use my SlingBox, which was the decisive disadvantage.  There may well be some technical fixes for this, but after  searching the internet and spending probably four hours, I found nothing that worked.  In sum, I see no real advantage to moving to this N router.</review>

<review id="9697">Great looking and a great price lead me to try this product. The pump on this thing was completely and acceptably noisy. The product was no cheap and the directions so poor that while I was assembling part of product broke off (a small clip). No matter how great it looks, if it's really noisy it won't work for me, let alone my felines, who wanted no part of the new loud creature. I quickly returned it and spent the extra dough to get myself the fabulously functioning Drinkwell 360 degree pet fountain. Well worth the extra money and it's pump is whisper quiet. Honestly. Just wish the Drinkwell had a mocha or chocolate brown- it's one color choice of speckled grey and white looks kind of 80's!

<review id="9698">- Way to small for an adult head- Way to small for adult ears- Absolutely horrible sound, much like listening under water- Unbelievably bad software and tons of it!  After installing the software my machine locked up while playing COD repeatedly.  Removed the software and suddenly the lockups went away.I really rely on the reviews for a product. In this case they let me down.  I can't believe these headphones are rated so highly.  I guess people will pay for the Creative name.</review>

<review id="9699">I'm a Registered Nurse. I use blood pressure cuffs daily. I thought it would be a good idea to have an electronic cuff for at home use. Using my manual cuff can be cumbersome....When this cuff arrived I took a baseline reading with my old cuff. After multiple aborted runs this device finally started to record pressures...5 readings over 30 minutes and not one was even close to the previous one...the readings were all over from coma to stroke range. Simply this device is a piece of useless garbage. Anyone relying on this for health reasons is in serious trouble. I intend to head to my local medical supply house and purchase a hospital grade monitor. It may cost more, but if my pressure is up I need to know there's a medical cause and not a mechanical defect.....DON"T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM.</review>

<review id="9700">This book was a little to melodramatic for my liking, especially the main character Bella.  Nothing truly new was developed and characters became more annoying becuase of the overkill on their personality traits. Everything that happened in this book was predictable. I will give that it is entertaining to see how right one can be when foretelling the events. I think it fell way short of the first two books. not sure whether or not I will check out the next book.</review>

<review id="9702">Two of these Magic Bullets have gone through our household. One as a gift, the other for our use. Ours broke quickly. For starters, the seals pulled out of the blender base. I called the company when the plastic gear in the base shattered, only to be told that "you'll have to buy another base", and "you should have bought the extended warranty" when in fact the little gear in the bottom could be pressed back into service in less than 30 seconds, and couldn't cost more than a couple of dollars. Save youself some grief, and stay away from this piece of mass-marketed junk. Happy to share pictures of my broken junk with anyone interested, because I hate being scammed. Buy a real blender, they cost less and don't break as easily.</review>

<review id="9703">Hello. I bought this drive(not from Amazon) because I found one close to home and I could look at it and touch it. It seemed well put together and I had been looking for a backup, so I bought it.Got it home and did everything the install guide said to do. Opp't out of the google toolbar and the 30 day trial and hooked it up. Seemed to start up fine but I was locked on the 30 day trial thing, so I said to myself, I change that in a minute, I'll let it download first.Well, then it said my files were to big, I got that worked out, I thought, and started download. 24 hours later nothing had happened! I also couldn't access the internet. Well, I says, I'll just safely shut it down, disconnect and reload and see what I've got. As soon as I disconnected I could get onto the internet but as I went to reload, nothing happened! couldn't access manual or any part of the drive.I wrote WD an email but have gotten no response eccept for the email verification. This is one of those things that to me it is much more hassle and expense to deal with WD so it is just sitting there on the shelf doing nothing.After this experence, I told WD that I would be hard pressed to even think of one of their products again. Also after this I wouldn't dare use it as an internal drive.My way in the past to deal with this kind of garbage is to take a sledge hammer to it put it in it's box and mail it back to the company.Yes it cost me to mail but it also lets me blow off a little steam. mightymike</review>

<review id="9704">I researched what is available on the market, and this router had all the features I wanted - MAC filtering, WPA password protection,  54 Mbps, can be used as a switch, works with PC and Mac. Trendware offered a nice rebate too. All this is great but when there is a wall between my PowerBook and the router, the reception drops a lot, and sometimes completely. It only works well when they are in the same room. This could be due to the fact that there are other wireless networks around which interfere with mine. I don't know. I thought I would give heads up for those looking for a reliable router.</review>

<review id="9707">I was initially pleased with the speed and operation of this drive until I rebooted my computer.  I own a DELL XPS M1330 laptop with Windows Vista SP1.  After reboot my laptop would not recognize the drive.  I had to powercycle the Seagate 1 TB freeagent drive and then the drive would be recognized.  I repeated the reboot multiple times and the behavior was consistent.  I had to power cycle the external drive every time.  I bought this drive to replace an old 160 GB external hard drive that I made by pulling an internal drive from an old computer and putting it in an external case.  This old drive worked every time and still works without having to reboot my laptop.  It is however, now making death sounds which is why I need to upgrade.  I ended up returning the Seagate drive.  It did, however, work better than the 1 TB Western Digital My Book drive, which did not work at all with Windows Vista after laptop reboot.  If anyone knows of a good 1 TB drive that works with Vista, please post.</review>

<review id="9708">If anyone wants great sound expected from Logitech products, this pair of headphones does the job. But for me, a gamer, these headphones are inadequite.    First of all, these headphones take a little getting-used to, but will feel comfortable after a couple days of use. Beware though, the headphones do not come with an adjustable piece which goes behind the head, so some (such as me) may find it very cumbersome with these headphones only secured to your head with the over-the-ear plastic.    Secondly, the microphone on the headphones sorely lacks voice recognition: I had to move the microphone right in front of my mouth for it to pick up anything. On top of that, the microphone broke after a couple weeks of use.    Overall, I would go to another Logitech product if I were you.</review>

<review id="9709">I had read a lot of reviews on the Twilight series before finally deciding to start the first book. It was well-written for it's target audience (teens), I thought, and very entertaining for me. I found myself quickly entwined in the lives of Bella Swan and Edward Cullens. I tore through books 1 - 3 in the series and while they weren't without some flaws, they were really great reads. SO, I forked out the money for Book 4 "Breaking Dawn" believing that I'd be entertained beyond measure because that's when the clinchers fall like rain and surely all the bad reviews I was hearing about it were wrong since books 1 - 3 were great. Authors save the best for last, right? I was very sadly disappointed. The book starts out wonderful enough with a beautiful wedding. Then we jump to the honeymoon (which doesn't go into explicit details and keeps the reading at the intended age) and see Edward and Bella enjoying married life until something threatens their happiness - but instead of focusing on that we jump into another story. WHAT?! After I gathered my bearings, I sluggishly trudged through the most boring portion of the book. The thoughts/insights/perception of Jacob Black ("werewolf"). From that point on, I mostly sighed dejectedly through the book. It just seemed so hastily written that you couldn't wind your way fully into the story. Renesme could have definitely been reworked a bit to make it more believable, Jacob's imprinting shouldn't have been so ridiculously stupid, the whole "battle" was even more laughable - though you are happy to have certain characters still intact by the end of the book. My biggest issue was the speed in which all the changes start taking place and the huge leaps that were made to make some concepts believable. I didn't mind Bella's new found abilities at first, but then they bordered on the ridiculous towards the end. I did enjoy the last few pages of the story, though, because it finally brought this somewhat agonizing read to an end and left me with one small smile.</review>

<review id="9710">The only thing I like this device is the throughput. When you configure the Ethernet interface at 100/full, you can get 80mpbs.The security design is not good:1. Only allow 8 characters passwords and special characters are not allowed.2. Each time you add a user or group to a share, it creates a new share instead of adding to the share3. It does not support Chinese characters.If you want good throughput, Enginsh only, and don't care about security, it works.</review>

<review id="9712">I was advised by a local pet store groomer this was the perfect device to use on my long haired cat who mats constantly.  I first used it on my other cat and was amazed at how much hair was removed.  However, I felt some of the hair was not loose & ready to be shed.  When using it on my long haired cat, it did not safely remove the mats but instead wanted to pull them off.I also did not like the sharpness of the blade & felt it was not safe enough to use on "quick to move" cats.  I now use a rubber glove (labeled to use for dog bathing) with rubber teeth.  It safely removes shedding hair, massages their skin and they love it.  A friend of mine also tried this and came to the same conclusions.I would not recommend this to any of my friends.</review>

<review id="9713">I read through lots of Amazon reviews for blood pressure monitors before buying the Omron HEM-780. It had many great reviews and extra features I wanted, like the stroke alert and memory storage for two people, which I needed to record both left and right arm pressure. Unfortunately, I seem to have gotten a lemon. I became alarmed when my blood pressure measured even higher than at the doctor's office. I brought the Omron to my next doctor appointment and discovered the Omron was consistently 20 points higher on both systolic and diastolic measurement than accurate. With so many good reviews, I can only assume this was just a bad unit. Amazon made the return easy and when I called Omron to tell them my experience, they had two people call me to get details on the problem. They told me this was highly unusual and would pull the machine for testing when it was returned. I still would buy an Omron product, but I would definitely check the accuracy with a doctor after buying it.</review>

Of course the particular one didn't like this brush, which was not a surprise, even though many of the reviews I saw indicated that the animals "loved" this brush.  The real surprise was the "non-particular" cat, who also didn't like being combed with this product, even though he'll let me hold him upside-down as long as I'm petting him.  But he got up and walked away from this brush.</review>

<review id="9716">I am surprised the worst comments are about splitting the season into two parts.  Sure, that is worth commenting on, but has anyone else recognized problems with this season?This is a very good show and is recommended for anyone looking to watch quality programming.  The writers took what was a campy '70s show and made it into one far more serious and realistic than expected.  Some portions of the third seaon did lack what made the show great, but those were in small numbers.  Overall, the show is worthy of far more attention than it probably gets.However, the first part of the last season lacks quality in many respects.  While the show always has played on pathos to move scenes and episodes, this season, so far, has relied on emotion so much that the stories have become unreliable and unbelievable.  A major reason is because too many important events happen too quickly, and the lack of explanatory depth creates more confusion about what is happening and disappointment in the story as it is told.  For instance, why would the cylons fall apart after being a tight group for so long through many trials?  Why remove Six from Gaius and link her to Tigh?  And why use emotion, by itself, through most of these episodes--so, so much of it--as the source of transition from scene to scene to end of episodes that the story only works if the viewer is totally sold on the emotion on screen?  The story for this season has severely suffered.  The first episode and the last in 4.0 are good, but every other episode is missing good story transitions and explanations.  A lot is happening too quickly.Thus, the narrative, not really the acting, is what lacks so far.  A part of the problem is that the physical space that Galactica moves through is not as expansive as in past episodes, so a series of stories must be told in a limited time frame and space (but still fit in a given number of episodes).  That is not necessarily a problem, but the issue is that the stories along the way are rather poor in the storytelling and not really encouraging to follow.  Week after week, I was waiting for something to happen--anything really--that would offer a reason to want to watch the following week.  Week after week, I was disappointed, teased by the idea that an episode might focus on something more important than, say, Gaius Baltar's conversion from a scientist to an icon of worship.  To see Gaius Baltar recite the same lines from Briget Jones's Diary was numbing (as well as seeing him change from a man of science to a cult figure who had a stake in religious affairs); hearing Kara say, "All I want to do right now is frak," well, was just stupid and added nothing to the story (not because of sexual reasons but because it really did not move the story anywhere).  These patterns of storytelling remind me of the various Shark Hunter films, b-movies about giant sharks, that are horrible but succeed with viewers who are already sold on the concept of giant sharks still existing and bent on eating people (not a food source that they would likely eat or even give a dorsal fin about).  This is not what made the show worth watching.I have hope for the second part of this season, and I am sure the DVD will be put together well, but the episodes so far this season are, by and large, the worst in the series.  I expected a lot more from the people who put together very good seasons previously.  So here is hoping that the remainder of this show will be told well.</review>

<review id="9717">I bought this one to set up all my home networks. I have 3 PCs and 4 notebooks. I wanted to use 1 PC as a file server and connect all the other computers to it.

<review id="9718">I'm a business owner.  I have been used the product since 1996. I hate this product.  I used Microsoft Money for Business before and never had printing problem.  It drives me nuts every time when this message comes up.  "Unable to verify the active printer at the system level.  Please verify the printer is turned on and try again." I bought a USB local printer just for using Quicken Home & Business software. I spend hours and hours to reinstall all printers and delete all printers and reinstall and uninstall the Quicken software as instructed by Quicken support. It works sometimes.  It doesn't work sometimes.  If you have a network or wireless printer, I strongly suggest DON'T BUY Quicken Home & Business Software.  It just gives you more headache.  If you google the error message above, tons and tones people having the same printing problem. If you go to [..] it still don't solve the print problem. Supports from India will tell you reinstall again and again. Unless if you want to buy a dedicate computer and a dedicate printer just for using Quicken software.  It stops me from switch back to Microsoft Money because all my business files in quicken format. I'm stuck with this problematic software. Don't buy it.</review>

<review id="9719">I dropped a friend's Flip Video camcorder and it shatterd the outer front glass lens & damaged the silver ring around the lens.  I emailed the company (the only way you can reach the "repair dept") about repair. I knew it was NOT covered under warranty but I was willing to pay for the repair of the lens as the camcorder was still operable. I got an email back advising that the lense was not repairable or replaceable - which I found hard to believe as the camcorder is built out of seperate components. I purchased my friend another one and retained the dropped one. Searched the internet to see if anyone else had my problem and found others that were told the same thing- can't be replaced or repaired. Well, I took my time & using a pair of tweezers, removed the silver outer ring & pulled out all the pieces of the broken glass. Under the broken lense there is still another smaller glass lens - so - EUREKA- the problem was solved. I shot a video & it was clear as when my friend had used it the night before it was dropped. Hope this helps some other folks.</review>

<review id="9722">Out of the box, my Linksys WRT54G wireless router was great.  The Linksys is inexpensive, easy to set up, and has good range.  The problem is wireless access.Now that I'm mainly using the router wirelessly, it is crashing all the time.  I've had to reboot (walk to other room, unplug power cord, wait a few seconds, plug in back in) ten times today.  Trying to be smart about it, I decided to look for a firmware upgrade.  The upgrade was easy to find on the Linksys website, so I downloaded it.  Unfortunately, Firefox would not upload the firmware to the router.  After a few failed attempts, I tried a different browser and was finally able to upload the firmware.  After processing the software update for a few minutes, the upgrade failed with this cryptic message "Upgrade are failed".  Bad enough the router crashes from wifi use.  But the router is so buggy I can't even upgrade the firmware??  Searching the internet, I found a lot of other people are having problems with this router crashing too.  Just 1 day ordered a new router from a different manufacturer.  Let's hope that works.</review>

<review id="9730">I absolutely loved the first three books of the series.  Read them all within a week of each other only a month ago.  This fourth was mind-blowing--and not in a good way, I'm afraid.I didn't see the Cullen family portrayed as they had been in the first three; here, they were one-dimensional and under-utilized.  I grieved because they were the reason I loved the first books.Was the ending "happy?"  I guess so, but it was unsatisfactory.  There was no climax, just a rambling way to the happily-ever-after with little avenues here and there that made for a vaguely interesting journey.There were some things I loved!  Bella's waking up as a vampire and how she experienced it.  I actually liked the birth scene--very dramatic.  The first time she sees Jasper as a vampire.  Liked Jacob's section--the chapter titles were inspired!  Loved Jacob and Edward's relationship in the second section.  The baby.  So Bad!  {shudder here}  But I could have lived even with little Renesmee if the book had made me feel something.  I never for a second believed that anyone was in any real danger.  Were we really supposed to believe that Alice and Jasper had abandonned them?  I Never, for a split second, believed that.  The hint that Alice left for Bella--so much more could have been done there!  What happens to Leah?  Oh, there was so much that could have been done with this. . . but sadly, it wasn't.  Stephenie Meyer is an amazing, gifted, remarkable storyteller.  This book doesn't come close to proving it. A very sad let-down.</review>

<review id="9732">I bought the 60-minute Flip for my wife for Christmas.  We shot about 50 minutes worth of footage, and uploaded to our Mac.  This process was not intuitive; it required some deciphering of the instructions and installation of DiVX codecs (even though I already had some DiVX codecs installed).But after I downloaded the video to the computer, the Flip seemed to "forget" that it was empty.  It was. I checked multiple times, on different computers.  I would record about 2 minutes, then display "Recorder Full".  After we pulled off the 2 minutes of footage, the Flip STOPPED WORKING, period.It would then display "Camera Empty".  But when we hit the record button, it would refuse to record, displaying the message "Recorder Full".  Well, make up your mind, Flip!!!The online forums haven't been much help.  I'm going to update the Flip's firmware today, and see if that does it.  Regardless of how cute and portable it is, if it's not reliable, it's just useless to me.  I feel like I'm out $130, and we've missed many family moments that we thought we'd be able to easily record.  PASS ON THE FLIP UNTIL THE PRODUCT BECOMES MORE RELIABLE.</review>

<review id="9733">After reading Twilight, I had high hopes for New Moon but soon found myself VERY disappointed. Edward leaves Bella in the effort to giver her a normal life. I don't understand why he thought she would live so easily without him. He clearly stated that he didn't want to live without her and she is WAY more obsessed with him than he is of her so why did he assume she would be ok? Alice even told him that she would not be ok! The fact is that she definitely wasn't ok. She was severly depressed and ANNOYING! The fact that she is so obsessed and dependent on Edward makes me want to vomit. Get a backbone, Bella. He left you...get mad and do something about it. When Edward does reappear she's not even upset with him. She's more than happy to take him back. She tells him that it wasn't his fault at all when in reality it is. By the end of this, I was not a very big fan of Bella. Jacob was great...the best friend one could ask for. Right now, I'm leaning more towards Jacob than Edward. Edward is controlling and stubborn(even though I still love him) but Jacob is sweet kind and realistic. I'm going to have to say that SM could have done a better job with this book.</review>

Then the laptop couldn't find the wireless network (despite the fact that it found five wireless networks operated by my neighbors). After an hour on the phone with Netgear, they advised me to do a firmware upgrade (uploading new software into the unit) despite the fact that I had just bought it. After another hour, this didn't work. They finally admitted that &quot;there's a problem with the latest XP software running MSN Messenger&quot; and that I should return it. Lots of time wasted. I won't buy another Netgear product again.</review>

<review id="9735">I was bored tonight and read through almost a hundred reviews of this thing. Im 30 years old, and pretty busy with work and life. I'm totally convinced that 95 out of the 100 reviewers I read are, either much older, or have much more time then I do to deal with cat litter. I have two cats. I had this box for about three months, and I spent more time messing with it then if I just would have laid down a plastic box and filled it with litter. It was fairly cheap, so I took a chance, but for those of us in the fast lane, I'd suggest spending the extra money and looking at the Scoop Free LB1 Self-Cleaning Litter Box. Cost me a buck, but 3 more months in, no mess, no hassle and no problems. It's not perfect,but it cuts down on the time you have to spend dealing with the litterbox, and my two cats have had no problem getting used to it, because it looks pretty much like a litterbox you'd buy in wal-mart or wherever, unlike that other one that looks like R2D2 and costs twice as much. (Litterbot or Litter Robot, I think?)</review>

<review id="9736">Yesterday I bought an iPod 4th generation. I was very happy with my old iPod but sadly it broke. Anyway, after I was happy with my new 4th generation iPod I wanted to fall asleep and listen to some songs. Here I got my problem. If I put the volume of hte ipod down the music is still very loud. Too loud to fall asleep with.I called the support hotline and they said it was a hardware problem. So the next day I went to the store any brought the iPod back. They gave me a new one. As soon as I put new songs on there I realized that it had the same problem. I walked back to the store to get my money back. I didn't want to have a another one from that store.After I walked to another store to buy my iPod there I figured out that it also had the problem and that I also couldn't put down the volume there almost all the way.I called the support. What they said now was that this was no bug/error but a feature.I'm very disappointed. My iPod I could put on the volume I wanted. Why does Apple those things to it's customers? I hope that they are going to come up with a software update that resolves the problem.In the last days I brought THREE iPods home. The employees at the store also believed it that to be a bug/error. After I brought them the second iPod back they even thought about contacting Apple to tell them that they got a whole series of broken iPods.</review>

<review id="9737">Pretty disappointed that just after a year's use, the volume started jumping all the time.  Same thing other buyers have reported.  I ordered a 2nd thinking the problem would've been fixed.  Same problem.  Thank goodness for Visa's warranty extension.</review>

<review id="9738">The set-up was easy and the hard-wired part of the router worked, but it didn't broadcast any wireless signal.  I spent a cumulative 5 hours with tech support to no avail.  They recommended that I return my router and get a new one.  I had v2, they said try a v1.  There were no replacement netgear routers available at Circuit City, so I exchanged it for a linksys which was functioning fine about 5 minutes after I had it out of the box.  Looking at the reviews, it seems hit or miss what router will work, and I've heard of people having issues with both companies.  But from personal experience at least, the linksys is great!</review>

<review id="9739">My parents bought one of these to get an additional desktop online on the opposite end of the house -- I tried to install it, no dice. Called tech support, spent three hours going over settings, they finally told me that version 5 was a new version and had software bugs, so I should return it for a version 2 or 3. Took it back to the store and realized that there are NO VERSION NUMBERS ON THE BOX so of course how am I supposed to find a version 2 or 3? Called Linksys again (in the Phillipines BTW) and was told to get another version 5. Brought it home, of course it didn't work again. Spent another 3 hours on the phone with tech support to no avail. They want me to send it back to them directly and switch it out for a version 2 or 3 direct from Linksys but I think I will spare my time and just get the phone company to install another line.</review>

<review id="9740">The DIR-655 dropped WIRED connections at least once an hour and the wireless is off more than it is on.  You would expect any router to be able to permanently keep a wired connection up without any configuration.  After some weeks of trying various versions of the bios and all kinds of tips I found online, I finally gave up and bought the $32 Belkin-G wireless.  The Belkin also drops the wireless connection now and then, although not nearly as often.  The great news is that the Belkin has yet to drop a wired connection no matter how long I am on or how much I download.  Configuration was easier with the Belkin, too, especially the wireless password.  It allows you to use a normal pass-phrase as an alternate to the long hex string.  This makes it so much easier to add your computers to the wireless network.  If the d-link supported this, I never figured out how to do it.  I wish I had not debugged for so long as it is now too late to return it.  If you can't get it working in a few days, send it back because it never will work.</review>

<review id="9741">I love the idea of the Asus Eee PC. I've long wanted a nearly full-featured laptop in this size. So after reading so many positive reviews for this I decided to go ahead and get one. Sadly, after a mere two days playing with it, I have an RMA to get a refund. So what's my gripe with it? Several things. Firstly, though this machine has "20GB" of storage, its 20GB is spanning two storage devices, it's not a single drive. The formatted capacity here is 3.74GB for the main faster SSD that the OS runs from, and 15GB for the slower secondary storage. I purchased this version and installed XP Pro on it (since the XP version only comes with 12GB). 4GB is simply too small. After installing and updating XP, there was just no room left to install any apps I wanted, even after cleaning up the drive. Secondly, the touch pad and buttons. The touch pad is WAY too sensitive and finicky, frankly it's just terrible. Even knowing this and trying to carefully tap click, it would way too often instead perform an extremely fast double click, and it would often repeatedly/consecutively do this. This gets extremely irritating very fast. Updating the touch pad driver had no effect for me. As for the touch pad buttons, they are way too stiff. Perhaps they wear down after a lot of use, but I'd go insane before ever finding out. Lastly, and the least excusable, is the battery life. For a device like this it's simply inexcusably awful. This is with the 5800mAh battery: with wireless OFF (FN + F2) and the screen dimmed down to its second most dark setting (which is really unacceptably dark for all but the very best-lit environments), this thing barely lasted over 2 hours. One more battery cycle to confirm this pathetic performance and I was ready to box it up and send it back. I can forgive a lot of things regarding a tiny laptop, the small screen, small keyboards that are tricky to type on, etc. That is totally excusable. But what a tiny laptop with a small screen, no optical drive, and a solid state hard drive should absolutely excel at is battery life, and this fails horribly. Less than 2.5hrs with a darkened screen and disabled wifi is just inexcusable. If you're still really intent on a micro laptop, I still wouldn't recommend the 900, I'd highly recommend you just wait a few weeks for the Eee PC 901. It features the new highly efficient Intel Atom which uses far less energy and therefore improves battery life (hopefully Intel will develop a new efficient chipset to go along with it). I still love the idea of an Eee PC and look forward to what Asus and other companies will have to offer over the coming year or so. If this had a minimum 8GB primary SSD, a far better touch pad and buttons, and the battery lasted 4+ hours with wifi enabled and the brightness halfway up, I'd love it.</review>

<review id="9743">These comments focus primarily on Word and Excel, which are the applications I use. I have a 2.2 Ghz Core Duo 2 MacBook Pro with 4 gigs of RAM, so this is a very fast computer by most measures. Keep this in mind while reading my comments.Pros:1.	The toolbars are better integrated into the workspace.2.	The graphics look a lot better.3.	File sizes are smaller in the new native format.Problems:1.	Resizing a window is incredibly slow and takes 100% of the available computer power. It feels like you're using a computer from years ago. 2.	The first launch of an office program after a restart takes a very, very long time - at least twice as long as a Office 2004 program.3.	You can't edit equations from the Windows document format of Office 2007.**edit this is supposed to be fixed now (not sure because I went back to Office 2004)4.	Any equations you make in Microsoft Word print fuzzy unless you reopen each one prior to printing. For a long document, this process sometimes takes me about 10 minutes just to print a document I created years ago and resaved in the new format.5.	Excel crashes about twice per day, even when working on new documents with just a few cells.**edit this is supposed to be fixed now (not sure because I went back to Office 2004)6.	Documents created in the new native format take much, much, much longer to open than the exact same documents in the old format.7.	Compared to Office 2008, Office 2004 is amazingly fast and is much more stable.8.	The overall program is buggy. Things like adjusting or removing tabs don't work correctly - generally, it only registers something after a long delay.9.	Every document I create double-spaces between paragraphs. I can turn this feature off for a given document, but I can't save a default. Every time I save the default document template, it ignores this setting for some reason.**edit this is supposed to be fixed now (not sure because I went back to Office 2004)In short, this is stunningly poor software, with a new challenging annoyance around every corner I've turned. I'm continually surprised by how unresponsive and slow the software is, and compatibility with older versions of Office is fairly bad. I would recommend staying with Office 2004 or buying it instead of Office 2008.March 24, 2008: I deleted Office 2008 from my system and reinstalled Office 2004. I'm much happier, and things work again!</review>

<review id="9747">I read several reviwers indicated that this MP3 has quality issues that may results in white screen out of box. I thought it may be a small percentage and I would try my luck. Unfortunately, The Zen arrived is a defective one with only white screening when it is turned on after charging. I was very disapointed and returned it back. Amazon is very good to take it back. They paid all shipping. I have no loss in this transaction. However, I am very mad at Creative creating such a bad product.</review>

<review id="9748">Initially, I liked this product.  I have what's billed as the newer version, and it seems to have corrected some of the problems described in earlier reviews.   However, we ran into a few problems with it, anyway.The set up was very simple - it was easy to set up the feeding times, and it was nice that the portion for each feeding could be set independently, so one meal could be a different amount than the others. However, I was disappointed that the amounts were so limited - as in 1/4 cup, 1/2 cup, etc.  Certainly isn't meant to feed small portions. Plus my fat cat needs to have her amount of food adjusted downward as she loses weight, and that's impossible to do.Our cat was able to get her paw up and get additional food out whenever she wanted some.  And when the canister is full, the weight of the food causes food to drop through the plastic dispensing fingers.  So extra food was frequently available.  Needless to say, the fat cat didn't lose any weight with this feeder.I think it's a fine feeder if absolute amount of feeding isn't as important.  If you want food to be dispensed a couple of times a day when you're at work, this would work.  But I wouldn't depend on accuracy with it.</review>

Although I've spent plenty of time in the manual and trying to tweak the program it is still a nightmare.  Perhaps I'm a moron--but I feel that a personal finance product should be moron friendly. I would have been better off with pencil and paper.  Quicken is way overpriced for the value you receive--none!!   Intuit deserves to go bankrupt!</review>

<review id="9750">This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) (DVD)          When someone is talking about a movie or a book and someone says "I hate it", I am usually the guy who says something along the lines of "Hey man, don't waste your energy hating movie that you don't like, just ignore it and move on." That being said, I HATE this movie.     When I go into a movie called Transformers I expect it to be about just that. What I don't expect it to be about is Shia LaDouche and his endless parade of two dimensional supporting characters to take center stage at all times and only see the Transformers when the explosions start. Look at the original Transformers: The Movie. There were two humans in it, they had like five lines between them, and even THEY could transform.    Even the much vaunted action was dominated by the humans. There were no really good robot-on-robot slugfests. Oh sure, there was a blow traded here and there, but it always cut away to one some kind of prolonged reaction shot or different and less cool fight altogether. One example was when Camaro Bumblebee (sellouts) and Evil Prowl were fighting and looking way cool doing it, the action cut away after like five blows so we could watch two teenagers fight with a stereo. After watching every dull awkward second of that lameness we see Bubmlebee approach, battered but victorious. What was apparently a very painful battle between giant robots happened OFFSCREEN. Later, Optimus Prime and Megatron called eachother out on the battlefield and flew into the epic battle we've been waiting twenty years for and it once again cut to the same freaking teenagers fighting the same freaking stereo!    Those are my main beefs, a couple other things I hated (I literally have nothing good to say about this cinematic upchuck) were the constant, goofy, quippy chunks of "humor" and the ever-present product placement. There was a ten minute long scene where the main character has an awkward masturbation related conversation with his moron parents while the Autobots bumble aimlessly and incompetently around his backyard while  Prime says things like "My bad". As for the other thing, there were a transforming Nokia cellphone and transforming Mountain Dew machine, enough said.   What I really hate is that as a true Transformers fan I will never escape this. I will go to Bot Con and it will be dominated by posters and booths and possibly Michael Bay himself signed copies of the "GM sponsored Super Special Edition". I will talk with my nerd friends about the show and people will chime in with "Are you talking about Transformers? I love that movie!" All in all I can sum up my thoughts like this: If at some pont in the future I get kicked in the balls, I can now smile to myself and say "Oh well, at least I'm not watching Transformers."</review>

<review id="9751">I had a smaller model kitchen aid mixer that finally wore out after years of use and because I still had attachments that worked well, and a great respect for the product, I decided to get a larger model - a professional 600.  This product does not deliver the quality of what Kichen Aid products used to represent. Large jobs overheat the motor causing it to turn off. I like the idea of it turning off instead of burning up but, in my case a large job is two batches of bread run back to back.  This 'Pro' cannot handle long run times using larger recipes, (I refer to the recipes included with the mixer).  In my opinion, this product is a waste of money because it does not perform as advertised.  Motor overheating seems to be a common complaint from reviews I have seen on the internet and I can surely vouch for the accuracy of the motor overheating during NORMAL operation.  I think Kitchen aid was bought out by some other corp. and the result is poor quality products that sell for a respected quality price.  They also ignore e-mails.</review>

<review id="9756">Before I ordered this, I had read a few reviews on here saying that this shaver is a bit noisy... but wow.  As soon as I turned it on for the first time it took me by surprise.  This has an incredibly annoying and loud buzzing sound - loud enough to perhaps wake someone up in another room.  First time shaving with this thing left me with cuts and random hairs peaking out all over my neck.  Unfortunately, I wound up finishing the job with my other razor.  I would strongly recommend buying something, anything, other than this.  I have owned cheaper and much better shavers in the past.</review>

<review id="9757">This version is buggy (like all Mac Quicken versions have been), and is annoyingly short on features.  It will download the same transaction from my bank multiple times.  And I can't get rid of some auto-fill categories, no matter how many times I delete them.What's worse:  Quicken Financial Life for Mac, due about the same time Quicken 2009 would have been available, is going to have even less features than Quicken 2007 for Mac (which was released in 2006).  Of course, that doesn't mean Intuit will charge any less for the "upgrade."  I'm sure QFL will end up being a subscription service, so Intuit can get money from the people who normally only upgrade every couple years.I only wish there was a viable alternative to Quicken!  I've tried all the other Mac financial applications, and they're all lacking, mostly in auto-download capability.  Why can't somebody make a better application than this dog?</review>

<review id="9758">I bought this product for it's simplicity and the mirror drive. The problem I have is it fails at providing the basics of what one would buy this product in the first place. The My Book I received is clearly defective but for obvious reasons. I was OK with the cheap plastic enclosure since I just plan to have it sit on the desk in a cool well ventilated spot. I like that it would do some power savings since I was not going to be using it all the time. I wanted a mirrored drive since drives fail and even if I can rebuild the data I rather spend the extra now so I would  not have to. I am sending my drive back it is defective but I learned something in the process that I can share. First the product is about the enclosure. Mirror drives Raid 1. I did not have anything fancy planned for this drive. All I needed was a USB connection and to format it for my MAC. No problem. The problem I encountered was the drive kept dismountnig. It would drop on writes and reads. There is no mention of this on WD's knowledge base or help. I checked the forums and there are many accounts of people having the same problem. Some say remove the software, update software, update bios, others say that does not help. I read it happening to both windows and mac users. The claim is the power saving feature causes the drive to go to sleep and unmount. I tried the power button on the back to wake it up but it did not do anything. I pull the plug and re power the device. drive came back. In playing with it I experienced a wide variety of behaviors.-press button and I have no idea what the button is for.-Ah when working properly the button wakes it up.-It does not matter if the drive is in use it will go to sleep.-setting everything in the OS not to sleep makes no difference.-The power light flickers when I plug it in and then no light-update bios not change, new drive manager software no change-No software still dismountsBasically it is this the the controller that has the power conector and the USB is incredibly cheap. It seems prone to having problems and WD is not being straight up about this. Out of all the parts of the enclose to be sturdy and reliable it is this component. It would be a better choice to buy two separate drives then this one. For me the main point was to have a nice neat package with one power cord and one box with mirrored drives. This is defeated by making the one critical part a liability above the drives failing. I only wish they took the time and money for the fancy flashing light and put it into making the power and USB component better quality.</review>

<review id="9759">They do not have availability for all tax info.  Specifically, Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), if you have estate losses which are delineated very specifically on a statement.  They have the form, a place for the code, but they tell you that's as far as they go.  They instruct you, if you have a statement, to read the IRS instructions to find out where else you can enter it on your 1040.  They have a support system in place to "Ask a tax adviser," but good luck getting them to respond.  They tell you online how long the wait is.  In my case, it was 4 hours via phone (should have been a clue how bad they are), 1 hour via e-mail.  I left a very specific email message on a Friday at 3 pm, and as of Monday at 10 am, still haven't heard.  You can only ask 1 question for free and you need a code they give you at the beginning for that.  After that, you pay $19.95 for each question, and they get the money up front.  I have always used TurboTax in the past and never had a problem, but heard they had a breach of personal information (which has been rectified), but thought I'd try H&R Block since TAX PREPARATION IS THEIR BUSINESS, and it was cheaper.

<review id="9760">**************************Spoilers Below**********************************I have read the 3 other books from the saga, and I truly wanted to like Breaking Dawn.   I am not a fanatic fan but I enjoy this series as a guilty pleasure when I need something light and easy to read.  Unfortunately, I just could not like the novel.  To be honest this novel felt like it was from a completely different series.  The interaction and connection between Bella and Edward was nowhere near what it is the other three novels.  I truly believe it was because Meyer introduced such a curve ball into the plot, which was the surprise child Renesme/Nessie.  Meyer has stated over and over again, that this series was the epic love story of Edward and Bella.  However, Breaking Dawn did not offer the last chapter of the epic love story.  Sure they had the wedding, which was romantic to a point but is seemed, too rushed in my opinion.  I am still wondering what Meyer found so exciting about writing the wedding to seemed to fall dead to me.   There were no details on how much love was shown in Edward's face while she was walking down the aisle or Bella's reaction to how handsome Edward looked; Meyer always seems to mention his beauty.  There was not a lot of interaction between her parents, her human friends, nothing.  Also why didn't she have a bachelorette party?  Sure not every bride has one but why no last hooray with the girlfriends that she was close to like Alice or Angela.  Yes that might not be in Bella's character in the first 3 books but you would think that Meyer would write Alice forcing Bella into one because it is definitely in Alice's character.The honeymoon could have offered so much more and shown the connection and love between the two.  Instead of telling us what they did, snorkel and fly through the jungle, why didn't she have any scenes where they interacted with each other, like in the meadow?  Sure they are soul mates and know each other so well, unlike their first time in the meadow, but Meyer still could have had more interaction that wasn't Bella begging for sex with Edward.The fact that Bella begged for sex still gets me.  Sure she made the deal to marry Edward to get sex in the first place, but it was ridiculous how much she begged for it while on Isle Esme.  (I still have an issue with that deal)  Also the fact that Meyer wrote Bella to take advantage of Edward's wishes of her going to college as a way for her to have more human sex was very absurd.  I can see why Meyer didn't give the readers a detail account of the sex but she could have at least given the readers a reaction of how she felt after and how she feels so much closer to Edward, considering how cheesy she can get.  The whole Vamp/Human baby still is a complete shock to me.  Having heard the spoilers, I seriously thought that that they were a rumor, how wrong was I.  I think that if Meyer had not made the famous statement of how vampires can't have children, it might not have been so bad.  To state that fact (vampires can't have babies) and then find a loophole is just a cope out to me.  Very amateur writing if you ask me.  The whole baby story line is amateur.  I personally found it hilarious how she foreshadowed her being pregnant by having her eat eggs all the time and also the fact that she was snacking on raw chicken while it was cooking and having her disliked the taste of cooked chicken.  The fact that she was only a little suspicious about something moving inside of her was dense.  Also the fact that Edward has gone through med school twice and didn't see something fishy until the last possible moment, how convenient.  Sure he thought that having a baby with Bella could never happen but considering that Bella is his world, you would think that he would be more observant to her "supposed" signs of pregnancy.  This whole story line made the vampires look completely stupid, Carlisle an accomplished doctor did not see that the Vampbaby needed blood until Edward hears it in Jacobs mind.  This could have been handled so much better if she had spent a little more time on details and thinking through how the characters would react.  They all seemed OOC.  Also isn't a vampire made through a bite, not created through intercourse?  That still doesn't make sense to me.  The name Reneseme is also an atrocious name and the nickname is even worse.  How is Nessie even close to Renesme?  I will give Meyer credit though; I thought that the child had cute characteristics if her situation wasn't so strange.  Growing at a rapid rate mentally and physically was such a convenient plot point for the Jacob imprinting.  I really don't have an issue with imprinting in general, just the fact that Jacob imprinted on Bella's kid.  I actually found the Quil/Claire story line very sweet.  The issue that I have with this imprinting is that Meyer states through Jacob's narrative that he had fantasized about Bella naked and most likely in sexual situations.   She then has him imprint on Nessie, her daughter, which is just creepy to me.  Why Bella's kid? Why not Leah? (I feel bad for that poor girl; she got shafted if you ask me.)The whole birth scene was disgusting.  Having not given birth myself, but having seen my sister's, I know that I can't physically understand the pain that can occur.  However that scene was just gruesome, it read like something out of Aliens.  To have that in a YA novel was very surprising to me.  I had to put it down for awhile when I was reading that scene.  The writing style and the amount of information that was occurring in the scene were very hectic and hard to follow.  The "epic" battle that was supposed to occur was a major disappointment.  The Volturi stalled and talked way too much for my taste.  After Irina's death, I wanted to see her sister's attack just to get some action.  I was expecting action like in Eclipse, not talk.  Also why did she have Garrett, a character that was recently introduced at the end of the novel and some one who the audience has no emotional connection with, give such an impassioned speech against the Volturi.  It just didn't fit.  The whole love shield was ridiculously used.  It would have been better if the shield had been used sparingly, not the whole time they were waiting to fight.  It made it to convenient.  It would have been better if Bella could suddenly able to master it when those she loved were in danger at the last moment, not the whole time.    The whole book was very rushed.  I missed the interacting between Edward and Bella and the Cullen family, especially Alice.  She made it seem like she was trying to make everyone's dreams come true, the E/B marriage, the transformation, having Jacob in her life, living happily ever after, having Bella's parents in the loop, ect. ect.  It just didn't work because those things don't fit all together according to her other books.  She did not set the other books up to have all of these things.  That is why this book is all over the place. And of course I realize this is fiction and not reality.  I am a fan of a happy ending so I have not issue with that I actually prefer it.  I just wish that she had stuck with what she set up in the other 3 books.  If she didn't want to have Bella have to choose and make sacrifices, she should have not set it up to make her fans see it as so.  I am still very shock about the content of this book.  I was really looking foreword to this book and was greatly disappointed.</review>

<review id="9761">The sound these headphones produce is great, I'll give them that, but they are made of a cheap plastic and less than a month after getting them, they are now broken. I just threw the box away a few days ago, so now I can't send it back for refund or exchange. The seller I bought it from requires the original packaging, and Saitek support is nowhere to be found.I don't know if mine was just a bad one, but from the look of the little plastic part that broke, I think it is a design problem and could probably happen again.</review>

<review id="9765">It is hadr for me to evaluate the compute because the operating system Ubuntu was full of glitches.  People often talked about it in other reviews saying it is a cheap way to get a mac.  Well a Mac with many glitches maybe.  Anyway if you want to live in Mac Donald's world with all its hip limitations as you get whoppered over the head with glitches on top of new glitches it nice.  Well what can you do Ubuntu is free so its no skin off sylvanias back.  I would say they would have do you a favor if they would have just Fdisk the hard drive and have it ready to install on any computer you want.The rocker button is way to stiff for as small at it is. The keyboard could be arranged a bit more creatively to allow crucial keys to be bigger and non crucial ones to be off to the side somewhere.  I wouldn't recommend it and I returned mine.</review>

<review id="9766">Well, I think this is what you would call a dud.  This little camcorder worked pretty well for about a month--quality of video shot was decent, ease of use was incredible.  Today, with no warning and no provocation, the device stopped working.  It is completely inoperable.  It won't turn on, it won't charge, my computer doesn't recognize it when plugged in.  My video--about 15 minutes of which is newly shot and hadn't been uploaded before the crash--is seemingly gone.  I am extremely disappointed and s**t out of luck because I bought this a month and two days ago.</review>

<review id="9767">What a terrible, terrible "upgrade".Excel 2008 _constantly_ hangs and freezes for 5-6 secondes each time when doing copy/pastes. Our product management and accounting teams have been wasting time and money since installing this absolutely horrible piece of software. The simple fact that Microsoft released this product is unbelievable. I thought the era of rushing buggy software out the door at MS was long gone, but I was wrong.Do yourself a favor, use Parallels and get Office 2007, which is a beautiful product.</review>

<review id="9768">Some people dislike this series because Bella is supposedly a bad role model, throwing away her mortality and her future for love. I've always thought they missed the point - this was a fun, fluffy story about a girl who is in love for the first time, and like most teenage girls, cannot imagine life without her prince. It can never be mistaken for great literature, but should just be enjoyed by teenage girls and housewives lying on beaches or trying to escape from their household chores.Then came Breaking Dawn. And even this housewife threw up a little in her mouth at what a mess it was.Some parts were good, but they were hugely overshadowed by the bad - inconsistent characterization, horrible writing, many typos and long chapters spent on things that had no bearing on the plot. Let's give Stephenie Meyer her author's prerogative to choose her characters' happily ever afters, and focus on the editing, or rather lack of editing, in this review.The biggest disappointment was of course the Volturi walking away after 100+ pages were spent building up the reader's suspense. But there are other chapters that could have been taken out or shortened, in order to focus on things that actually affected the plot. For example, all the whining about the wedding. We could have just started with the wedding scene and eliminated 3 chapters. And the scenes with J. Jenks. The ordering could have been done via email and the fake papers delivered to her front door.Additionally it was a mistake letting Bella narrate two chapters and Jacob one. Edward's presence was not felt enough. There was no emotional intensity between the two lead characters - oh, plenty of physical intimacy, but the lack of sensuality that Stephenie Meyer previously successfully depicted with just kisses. Perhaps this decision was made in order to leave the fans hungry for the next book in the series, which is the story of Twilight but written from Edward's point of view. But IMHO, leaving Edward out in this book was doing his character, and fans, a great disservice.</review>

<review id="9769">I hated this trimmer. My little dog hates getting her nails cut due to overzealous vet assistants. I had to work with her all week to get her used to this little buzzer being near her. When I finally touched her nail to the trimmer, she exploded out of my arms leaving me wounded and sweating. The experience wasn't nice for her and it gave me the willies similiar to hearing fingernails screeching down a chalkboard.Another problem is that you can't see what you are doing because there is a yellow plastic guard blocking your view. You have a wiggling dog to control on top of trying to do this blind.It is slow and would take a very long time-days-weeks to grind down my dog overgrown nails. I have decided to go back to clipping. (one nail a day until we finally have this under control) Now I have to unearth my receipt and send this baby back. I wish I could give it zero stars.</review>

<review id="9770">Indeed, the landscapes and images are astounding, but reviewers aren't talking about the plot to each segment.  There's the build up of our respected narrator with sweeping musical cues, then a "what's this...a cub emerging from its den? Is that a predator lurking?"  The musical cues switch to ominous minor tones, then it's either curtains, or a narrow escape.  Mostly curtains.  I pity our humble narrator who must have tired from reading the same plot line during each film.  Twenty years from now people who study these types of things are going to wonder what's up with the producers' wishes to instill a sense of awesomeness in the landscapes, only to punctuate this with 5-10 minutes of life on the killing fields (glaciers, skies, lakes, oceans, mountains).  At least Sweeney Todd has a line "the history of the world my sweet...is who gets eaten and who gets to eat."  That should have been a title for this series as well.  This is one macabre documentary for all its hi-def imagery.</review>

<review id="9771">On a Windows XP PC, I found this product very hard to setup initially which is why I gave it such a low rating. The fix was fairly simple but it appeared nowhere in Apple's literature and I only found it through extensive Googling. If I recall correctly it was to set it up as a bridge. Sharing music wirelessly from ITunes is a really great feature since it means you can toss the computer speakers and use your home stereo for music playback. I found the wireless range to be surprisingly good for such a small device and throughput is excellent. Finally, the styling is attractive so it isn't  another hideous wall wart and if you buy the Griffin stand for it, it looks even better. I have now switched to Mac and it is fantastically easy to set up and use. I rather regret giving it so few stars, if I could do it again I would give it 5 for a Mac and three for a PC.</review>

<review id="9772">I went through two of these within 2 weeks.  Both had the same problem.  After only a few hours of use, they just froze, then the display just went blank and could no longer use it.The reason I bought it in the first place was because I didn't want to jump on the ipod band wagon.  Well, after my experience with this hunk of junk I did, and I am very happy with my Ipod nano.  Save yourself some time and headache, just buy an ipod nano =)</review>

<review id="9773">This is my third year using Taxcut. Up to this year I have been very satisfied with it. I started a business in 2008 so I bought the Home & Business version. As of Feb 1, the interviewer for GA S-corporations is still not available. I've spoken to customer service 4 times who all have told me that the GA interviewer is available and all they can tell me is to update my software. I update the freaking software everyday hoping that my GA interviewer will start working but it still isn't available. I'm not an idiot, I know how to update the software. I've tried reinstalling the software and running the update from a fresh install but it still doesn't work. Maybe there's something wrong on your end H&R Block! I have resorted to downloading the instructions for my GA forms and filling them in manually since it looks like the interviewer will never work. If I knew I was going to have to go through the instructions for the tax forms myself I wouldn't have bothered buying Taxcut.I will never use Taxcut again, their customer service is useless and won't listen to your problems. Their only solution is to run the update. Next year I'm using TurboTax.</review>

<review id="9778">Please be advised I am speaking only about microsoft word.  The layout is completely different which in my opinion is a plus if it was conducive.  First of all, it is difficult to find the icons that were previously used and also the help topic isn't very helpful.  For example, I saw the word count on the bottom of the screen but I needed to know how to use the word count for just the body of the paragraph.  I figured it out on my own which is just select the section and on the bottom it will display the word count. First, I went to the help menu and typed 'word count', once I received the response I felt like I was in a never ending maze.  To think they made something that simple so hard to find. Actually I did not find it, I grew tired from searching and stopped.  For the most part, the help tool only confuses you more.  I have the majority of my issues when I am typing my work cited page or outline for my research paper.  When I did the work cited page it was suppose to be in MLA format well the great thing about 2007 is it has the option for MLA format the horrible thing is, it is not the correct format that neither my english teacher requires nor my english book states is MLA format.  For instance, it would not allow me to indent lines proceeding the first line.  It would indent the entire paragraph.  It drove me insane.  Don't try to do an outline, because the Roman numerals and the letters will likely not turn out the way needed or at least not MLA format.  What also irks me is, it constantly goes back to calibri, no matter how many times you change the font.  I now change the font when I am through but I should NOT have to do that.  I do like that I can save my documents at word 2003 so I can pull up the document almost anwhere. The only negative is I have to remember to go to "save as" then change docx to 2003, because the default is 2007 docx which is not compatible with anything else.The Cons: *The software tries to be sophisticated but instead does the opposite of what you want it to do. *Not user friendly when trying to do more complicated formats such as outlines, or work cited page. *Not as much flexibility, it constantly tries to override you. *Help menu is astrocious.*Constantly changes the font for no apparent reason.*No animated help icon to choose from.*Icons are packed together at the top of the screen which makes the top look congested, chaotic, disorganized and messy.*No outlookPros: *Can be saved as word 2003 docMy opinion is if you are using it for school then this will be a challenging tool to become accustomed with and not be frustrated with.  If you have the time or maybe you are only writing simple papers then it won't kill.  I expected that I would need time to become accustomed to the new product but I did not expect for the software to have bugs. I use excel and powerpoint for 2003, I am not going to figure out the one for 2007.</review>

<review id="9779">Could someone come up with a suggestion for using this product on two dogs? They both use the same bowl, so using 1/2 teaspoon per day per dog is kind of hard if not impossible to do. Even if it was one dog....they only eat a little each day. How do I know I am not bombarding them with this tear stain product cummalitively. It would be great if they just came up with a pill formula for Angel Eyes product. The reason for my no star review? I am still figuring out to give this 1/2 teaspoon per day to my two maltese.Sincerely,Barbara O'Brien</review>

<review id="9782">*I have a Tassimo given as a gift a few years ago & it makes coffee comprarable to Starbucks and Flavia. I love the African Kitamu straight up and also love espressos-coffees that are really stong with full body. The fact that the Tassimo has no "my K cup" equivalent bugs me. Thinking of all those plastic cups going to the landfill-ugh. So...excited to get the Keurig thinking I could make my own coffee pods and save the landfills.*I bought the Keurig Special Edition that came with the 18 variety pack of coffees. I tried all the decafs (watery, lukewarm). The hot chocolate-watery-no flavour.*Keeping an open mind, I tried the "bold" coffees in the AM as small cups-seperately then combined. Nothing helped. All were watery, bland. The problem seems to be at the end of the brew cycle. I watched it make a tiny 5oz cup-looked strong in the beginning but then dumps brown-coloured water at the end.*Like making a good cup of coffee then adding a handful of ice on top and letting it melt.*I may try a French press but for now is back to the Tassimo and back to the store where I bought it.If you like your coffee stong-this may not be the machine for you. If you like your coffee mild and/or mixed with milk or cream this might be just the thing-the better flavours were "coffee people" and "caribou".</review>

<review id="9783">I got my Furminator in fall/winter, and I feel so bad for my cats because it took out too much fur. Animals need a certain amount of undercoat in winter, don't they? I can't tell if it is more undercoat or more top coat that is gone, but it definitely looks like too much fur is gone. My kitty's fur looks too thin for winter now (fortunately, she's an indoor cat). Her fluffy tail lost so much fur that she looks sickly compared to how pretty she looked before we used the FURminator on her. This tool cuts or somehow removes too much fur and is more deception than effectiveness.</review>

<review id="9791">"Breaking Dawn" is the bestselling conclusion of Stephenie Meyer's vampire romance series. But is it worth it? Edward and Bella finally marry so they can do the deed (Bella wants her final human experience to be bedding Ed) At the wedding,werewolf Jacob Black warns her of what she might become. Edward has said numerous times "I'm a monster"--but Bella still wants to be a vamp."Breaking Dawn" has a few positive characteristics-The descriptive writingSome interesting premises-how would Edward,who's technically dead,be capable of fathering a child?That a lot of it is seen from Jacob's down-to-earth perspective. He's sympathetic,but in the end he gets downright creepy.However,the negatives outweigh the positives-The wedding night results in Bella being terribly bruised. However,she wants more. Glorified abuse.Bella's willingness to protect her unborn daughter at the cost of her life isn't all that pro-life. The unborn child is demon spawn.The birth scene is traumatic,with Edward chewing Bella's belly open.Then,there's Jacob creepy "imprinting" on Edward and Bella's spawn.Stephenie Meyer sacrifices the sensuality of the first novels with some bad writing when Edward and Bella finally consummate their relationship. Is Meyer trying to scare sensitive people away from sex and pregnancy? Her depictions of both are disgusting.Bella,being the Uber-Mary Sue,becomes the Perfect Vampire. She doesn't have to learn self-control,she has the shield of "love",and she doesn't have to disconnect from her family. And now she has Jacob as her future son in-law.The "final battle" with the Volturri is overrated. Enough said."Breaking Dawn" is breaking bad. It's unfilmable compared to the photogenic "Twilight." "Breaking Dawn" is horrific.</review>

<review id="9792">I cannot understand how this kettle get all these good reviews. I've been using water kettles daily since -94 and this one is __not__ a 5 star kettle.Pros:+ Looks cool(metal, illuminated water gauge, etc)+ Wide spout and pouring works great(no extra sipping through the lid, etc)+ Nice sturdy metal filter(no wire mesh)Cons(as many already pointed out):- The smell(will it ever go away?)- Measure scale hidden by handle(bugs the crap out of me)- Hard to hear the bell- Power button not optimally placed(in the bottom, beneath the handle. It bugs me)Comments:* Feels like the opening mechanism is not going to last very long...doubt it will last 5+ years of daily use...* I bought this since I wanted to heat soups/broths etc in it(like the product description says it does). But the inside have too many parts/edges and it will be hard to clean. I'll stick with water on this one.* Handle might stay cool, but it doesn't feel ergonomic(I have carpal tunnel and it actually hurts my hand lifting this one). Maybe this metal kettle is just too heavy compared to my other plastic ones..So far I must say the plastic kettle I bought 5 years ago for $20 is still far superior. With all these excellent reviews I expected something real nice. But now I just feel ripped-off and really disappointed on all the other reviewers...  If I didn't consider the price I would have given this kettle a 3 star rating... But with the price in mind I cannot give it more the 2. If I wasn't too lazy I would return this...</review>

<review id="9795">PRO: As a hardware package, the iPod Shuffle is the office cubicle ADHD head-banger's dream. It is elemental, inexpensive, discrete, rechargeable, and virtually indestructible. Synch the specific music you wants to hear...set it on the "shuffle" mode...put on your isolation (or noise canceling) headphones and...as Lordi says..."Get Heavy" while you work.CON: The iTunes software for Windows, in a word, stinks.

<review id="9796">I have now had two WRT54G routers, one was a ver 6, the other a ver 8.  Yes, I'm a glutton for punishment, but it was the only reasonable looking router at Walmart when I went to get one late at night after having a horrible day with the first.  Plus, I had done my research before buying the first, and convinced myself that it must have been just the specific router I had bought, not the whole line.  I was wrong.I am a software developer.  I work from home, and as a result am very demanding of my network equipment.  Perhaps if you're just a typical home user who checks e-mail at night, this router would do fine.With both routers, At about 1 or 2pm every day the router would just freeze up.  I would lose my IP address and wireless connection.  In order to fix it, it had to be unplugged then plugged back in.  Usually after doing this it would last another half hour or so, then exhibit the same problem.  Thinking that I might have some kind of wireless interference, I tried just plugging in a hard-wire between my computer and the router.  The router STILL had the problem.  Therefore, my conclusion is that it has nothing to do with the wireless side of things.  It's the router itself.My guess is that the CPU overheats after heavy usage.  I poked around on the web and found a few similar thoughts.  One guy had even modded the router to have heat sinks and fans in it.I am now using a Buffalo WHR-HP-G54, flashed with "Tomato" firmware.  I really love the user experience and the added features of Tomato.  The out of the box Buffalo firmware is pure garbage, but adding Tomato transforms it into an awesome router.  I've had it for about a week now, with no problems whatsoever.  Keeping my fingers crossed that it will continue that way.</review>

<review id="9797">I am extremely disappointed with the Omron company.  The clip that comes with this pedometer is of extremely poor design.  It falls off of your waist band.  The second day of use, I lost it.  It was a busy day and I have no idea where it fell off.  I contacted the company requesting a new one be sent or at least some sort of credit towards another one, explaining what had happened.  Well, if you can't return the product they will do nothing for you.  Of course it is impossible to return an item that has been lost due to poor design.  I have no idea how good the product is.  If you buy it, do not clip it to your clothing.  Put it in your pocket and make sure it will not come out otherwise you too will be out $30.</review>

<review id="9798">This season sucked just like the rest. I would say that this is the poorest rendition of Superman, and the creators of Superman should be ashamed. Clark Kent is a wimp, and not even written well at all. Still whining to his mother by season 5. Save your money, and go watch a show like Heroes. This is a season where an episode can be so awesome, then just suck the next. Like the episode "Cure". I stopped watching before the episode "Hero". Plus this show is just a downer with relationships. I could go on and on why the show sucks, but I'll just stop right here. The writers must be on crack while writing this series. I have a feeling the 8th season will suck as well.  If the show sucks so much, then why can't I stop watching for good?? :(</review>

Anybody who bought the so-called Brit DVD set are justifiably annoyed.  Odds are, they'll eventually release season 2 in its entirety, too, and probably at a much better price.  Patience is a virtue.</review>

<review id="9802">I have been loyally using Quicken and upgrading every year since 1997.  This year, I upgraded my Quicken Home & Small Business Premier to the 2009 version.  WOW, what a mistake!  First off, (we use this for business and have about 20 clients listed), accounts are NO LONGER listed in alphabetical order (in the bar on the left).  This may not be a big deal but when you have a bunch of accounts setup, it makes NO SENSE to get rid of this.  I tried MANUALLY re-ordering everything, but the interface is extremely slow and cumbersome.  After 20-mins and being only partially done, I gave up.  NEXT, 2009 imported my data file from 2008 but mis-categorized everything.  When you try to re-assign the category, I couldn't find it.  I called tech support and she couldn't figure it out, either (and acknowledged it could be a bug).  Also, when you setup a NEW customer account, the category option for invoice account is missing.  I could only call it a cash or savings account.  Again, in case i was missing something, I called Tech Support - they didn't know - said maybe a bug.  After a week, I sent the software back and then, since I couldn't use the up-converted data file in my OLDER version of Quicken, I had to spend 2-hours re-keying a week's worth of entries.  WHAT A DISASTER.  Quicken, you really blew this one!</review>

<review id="9803">NO Aluminium, and no non-stick coatings.  The baking basket is either aluminium, or it has a so called non-stick coating.  This is what makes this machine a no buy in my book.Of course those who manufacture aluminium cookware, and non-stick coatings downplay and health harzards but on the other hand so did the Tobacco Industry.  So I therefore stick to steel, or iron for cooking purposes, regardless of the nay-sayers.I would like to have a bread maker with a steel bowl, and without the so-called non-stick coatings.  So my review is for the health conscience, and therefore one star.</review>

<review id="9804">I should have read the negative reviews on this item before purchasing it. It's true that the router drops the wireless signal constantly. It does it so often that you basically cannot do anything without having to reconnect every couple of minutes. I updated the firmware. I followed the suggestions that other users of the product mentioned on the Linksys web site to no avail. The company does not admit there's a problem with this unit. But you don't have to believe me. Go to their web site and find out for yourselves. You can read other users' comments there.I requested a return and will be looking for something else.</review>

<review id="9805">I purchased a Sharp microwave oven, which worked fine for 7 weeks.I used it to heat soup, and for oatmeal in the morning.One morning it just broke.The door closed, the light and fan came on, but there was no heat.It emitted a burning plastic smell.Sharp service told me that I needed to have a Sharp-authorized technician examine it before it could be replaced.Unfortunately, the nearest Sharp-authorized service location is a two-hour round trip drive for me. They don't accept shipments, nor are they are not open on weekends.This means that in order for me to obtain warranty service on this relatively new product I would have to *take a day off work*, as it is too far to drive on my lunch hour.Also, one cannot return a product to Sharp for examination; as per the warranty you must "hand carry" or ship the item to a service location (if your service location accepts shipments).So I believe my current options are:1) find a local microwave service place, and pay for the service myselfor2) throw the oven awayI recommend not purchasing any Sharp appliance unless you know that a Sharp-authorized service location is close by.Best Regards and Good Luck!Mark</review>

<review id="9806">Just bought the program a couple of weeks ago (for $179 on Amazon). After entering the whole administration of 2008 I learned that my accountant cannot read my 2009 files in any way in his 2008 version. To solve the issue customer support suggested me to buy a support contract (which probably will not solve the issue anyway, reading the other posts).My advice: Do not buy the 2009 version!</review>

<review id="9808">This Sharp microwave was very powerful and cooked/heated foods quickly and evenly... for about 4 months. After that, the food started cooking unevenly, even if the item was placed in the middle of the rotating plate.After 6 months, I tried to heat up my stringbeans and it started a mini fire in the microwave! Thinking it was my plate, I switched plates and tried again.  2 seconds into the warming, a mini fire errupted again, but this time followed by a loud ZAPping sound.  I am scared to even try again, so here I am, shopping for a new one on Amazon.  I would not recommend purchasing this, and if you do, would recommend you stay close to it so that a fire does not start up!  It was pretty scary!And lastly,  the footprint of this microwave is HUGE and takes up a lot of space... so unless you are constantly heating foods for a huge family, I would recommend getting something smaller!!</review>

<review id="9810">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      Honestly, all I enjoyed from this movie was the gorgeous computer effects with the Transformers....but otherwise, it has a pretty lame plot. I thought I would possibly enjoy the humor in the film, but I felt like the director was forcing too much sexual jokes into the film (which I found to be more annoying than funny). Cheesy romance and drama. The relationship between Sam and Mikaela is nothing you haven't already seen in a low budget Disney movie. The movie itself was way too drawn out. I pretty much didn't care by the time the final battle came. I was a Transformer fan myself when I was a kid, but man, this movie just killed it.</review>

<review id="9811">I purchased Western Digital My Passport Essential 320 GB USB 2 Portable Hard Drive and when i tried to register at western digital website with the serial number it started saying me Out of Region Warranty.  This means that the item with the serial number was meant for use in European/Asian countries and the warranty was not valid.When i called WD customer service they asked me to send the proof of purchase and changed the region in their records so that the 3 year warranty is valid in US also.So before you destroying your purchase proof, make sure you register with WD website.  Not sure how could Amazon ship such items which are meant for sale in non-US country.</review>

<review id="9812">Generic film with generic plot elements and horrible acting. Fight the power, don't watch this film. The Academy has made many, many big mistakes. Remember Pulp Fiction? Lost the Academy Award to Forrest Gump, stand up for movies of true quality and lasting appeal.</review>

<review id="9813">Regardless of using Windows Media Player or simply dragging and dropping files, it did NOT want to play the files in alphabetical order. It always looked for track numbers (if available). Even if you sorted the files first in WMP.If you use WMP and keep everything in playlists, you'll be OK. But if you have various podcasts and songs you want to arrange in your own order of play, forget it. Your chosen order of play will be lost when you sync the songs. Same is true if you rename the files (a, b, c before the file names) in the order you want and then drag and drop.</review>

<review id="9814">This review is from: The Princess Bride (VHS Tape)      The Princess Bride (as of 31 October 2002) commands 86th place on the Internet Movie Database's 'Top 250 Films' list, which rather begs the question: WHY??? It is a somewhat alarming thought that there are only 85 films in the world considered to be superior to this mish-mash of action and syrupy sentiment held together by cheesy acting and wobbly scenery. Admittedly, there are some elements of the story which are really rather good, including the large variety of perils our hero (Westley) and heroine (Buttercup) must face; the shrieking eels, cliffs of insanity and fire-swamp are original and nasty pitfalls awaiting the unwary.Unfortunately viewers must wade through a lot of dross for these occasional rewards and the plot is a perfect example of this. A grandfather is reading his rather peevish grandson a story about two young lovers with somewhat unlikely names. Buttercup's sweetheart (supposedly killed by pirates five years ago) is in fact still alive, cleverly "disguised" with a black blindfold and an incredibly silly little moustache and pigtail. But Buttercup has become engaged (against her will) to the nasty Prince Humperdinck. This of course is a cue for multiple sword fights and near death experiences as the soulmates prove that true love will conquer all.Apart from the notable exception of Christopher Guest who plays Humperdinck's sidekick Count Rugen with a deliciously understated sadistic malice, the acting is largely overcooked. Perhaps this is just as well; if the viewer's attention is monopolised by the actors, they will be less likely to notice the bendable swords and polystyrene rocks. This is not to say that the film isn't entertaining - it would certainly while away a rainy Saturday afternoon - but to accord it the status of a classic is inconceivable.</review>

<review id="9815">Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker was OUTSTANDING; no one else will ever be able to get it right after him.  Other than that, the movie was about an hour and a half too long and more than a little boring - I actually fell asleep a couple of times.  I like Christian Bale as Batman except for his Batman voice, which annoyingly sounded like he'd been eating rusty nails.  Hopefully, next time, they'll shorten it a little...absolutely no reason for a movie like this to be 3 hours long!</review>

<review id="9816">I liked this machine-- had it over a year and then it stoped working-- lot of money to just huck in the trash.  Also you cant adjust for the size of your coffee mug.

<review id="9817">This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) (DVD)      Most people thought this movie would fail at the box office, and it didn't.It prove to be a huge blockbuster summer hit.I really like this movie. It is very entertaining and serves it purpose well. I mean, it is not the best movie ever made, but it is way better than Spider-Man 3 and Pirates, that's for sure.Now the DVD is not what I was expecting.The above rating is for the DVD, and not fot the movie itself.I didn't buy it, but when I read its content I felt like something was missing. Other than the movie, it doesn't have interesting special features. I'll rather wait a few months or maybe a year 'till they release an extended ultimate director's cut super sized limited collector's edition that I'm sure will eventually surface.Like King Kong.Just wait and see.</review>

<review id="9818">We never had any diaper rash issues when we used Pampers Sensitive (used for about 8 months).  Then I found that 7th Generation had wipes, so I got them.  Unfortunately, since switching, we've had diaper rash issues.  They are not too bad if you wash them out with plain water, but even then, they seem to aggravate the skin.  Also, they smell very strange (in a bad way) and are generally not as good as the Pampers.I wish I could like them, but we're going back to Pampers.  7th Gen really needs to change the formula they're using to address the rash issue.</review>

<review id="9819">I purchased two of these for my son and daughter last year for Christmas gifts. At first they were fine, easy to use (these were our first mp3 players)and they really enjoyed them. After a few months my daughters began to act up with the screen and not play, but if she shut it off and turned back on it would be fine. Then a few months later nothing, it quit all together. Then a few months later my sons quit working too. I would not recommend this product at all. VERY DISAPPOINTED!</review>

<review id="9820">This flash drive has a bad habit of automatically going into write-protect mode.  There is no way to get it out of this mode.

<review id="9821">OK... I was waiting for answers and all I got was more questions!! and I agree totally with the reviwer that said that the whole purpose of the show now seems to be to see how many loose ends can the show create without explaing them!!I mean it seems like the writers actually forget what happened in episodes from earlier seasons and act as if these episodes never took place. Things dont even make anysense anymore.. and the worst thing is trying to invoke science fiction that is totally unscientific.I am a physicist and I am hugly insulted by the shows failed attempt to involve physics in reasoning (if it can even be called reasoning). the writers have no idea whatsoever what science fiction means. So in short this season is complete nonesense and it shows clearly that the writers have no clue where things are doing. they just wake up in the morning deciding (ok.. lets make the sun rise from the west today on the island.. cause its a SPECIAL island and we dont need to worry at all about explaing the phenomina cause the stupid veiwers will be awaed by any nonsense we spit on paper)So save ur time and brain for better things. As for me this will be the last lost season I watch cause i respect my own intelligance.</review>

<review id="9822">My dogs HATED this.  I clip their nails but wanted to at least file the edges with this product. Nope. They were both scared to death when I touch their nails.

I've got this product circulating around with my friends so they can try it and not waste their money, too.</review>

<review id="9823">This is not a very useful product, it does not come with all the attachments of a larger food processor.  All I really bought it for was to chop, but it tends to just make a mush out of whatever I put it in, despite numerous attempts to vary my method.  It simply will not uniformly chop things like onions that I wanted to save time from doing by hand.</review>

<review id="9824">Very disappointed in this product.  Washed pillow cases before use and they came out of the dryer totally wrinkled.  Needed to iron before using.</review>

<review id="9825">This machine comes with a 1/2 cup measurer which serves as the butter melting dish too. If you use less then the full 1/2 cup measure, it throws out lots of unpopped corn. Even with the full 1/2 cup, it throws out a several unpops before it starts popping. The butter melt cup is nice, but the time it takes to pop the corn is not enough time to melt the butter...I even sliced it down to smaller pieces. Also there is no on/off switch. You have to plug it in to turn it on and unplug it to turn it off - that just seems antiquated to me. I do not recommend this popcorn maker.</review>

<review id="9826">After an exhaustive search to determine what burr grinder I should buy for my new espresso machine I settled on the Capresso 560. While reviews on every site were mixed, I decided that given the price and the number of positive reviews it was a safe bet -- I was WRONG! The product is much worse than I anticipated, and left me wondering how sooo many people could give this product a 5 or even a 4 or 3 rating. My experience left me in wonderment regarding the amount of ground beans left in the machine.  Numerous people complain about the "static" problem, but honestly this is only part of the problem.Before I go further, let me state for the record that the only reason I wanted to buy a burr grinder was that I want daily properly fresh ground espresso beans. The key word here is: FRESH. For anyone who is a coffee connoisseur, you know that the minute that air comes in contact with a ground bean the flavor begins to change - the longer the amount of time the less "fresh" the taste. Ergo, when one uses a grinder the vast majority of the ground beans needs to end up in the container or doser, and then should be used shortly thereafter. This is where the Capresso has problems; after grinding there is so much left in the body of the grinder that it ends up taking me 15 - 20 minutes to clean it out (this versus the less than 2 minutes to grind the beans).  I have several friends who have higher quality grinders that I have used (one of my favorites is the Rancilio Rocky, but at $325 I bought the Capresso to save money).  In hindsight and based on personal experience, the Rancillio is the better bargain.My only recommendation regarding the Capresso is buy it if you want or do not mind the following:1.	An inexpensive grinder that does a good job grinding and operates fairly quietly2.	Having the majority of your daily ground beans be stale given that most of what ends up in the container is from the previous grind (the ONLY way to avoid this is to spend 10 times as much time cleaning the grinder after every use as is spent actually grinding the beans)!My conclusion: spend a lot more money to buy a top quality product (such as the Rancilio grinder) or spend a lot more time cleaning your grinder than you do grinding your beans, making your drink, and drinking your beverage.</review>

<review id="9827">This review is from: Wall-E (Three-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)      I have to start out by saying that I loved this movie and I could not wait to get a copy. Boy, I didn't know what I was in for.I've returned 3 copies to Wal-Mart now.The movie would skip and freeze, occasionally losing the sound afterward for a few seconds throughout the disc. The odd thing was how the skips occurred at almost the same places on all the discs. I really want to blame the horrid packaging for this movie. The feature film disc was more of less free-floating in the case, a wondrous cardboard concoction that barely holds the disc in place. This applied to both the singe and three-disc versions of the movie.Another problem with this I found out in my efforts to return the movies. Disney has the backing of some sort of federal law (that no one could ever really explain to me) keeping anyone from getting their money back from this movie (and probably others they distribute as well). It took 3 returns and a lot of complaining to some low-level employee to get them to break the rules at Wal-Mart, just to get store credit. It didn't get me what I wanted but it's better than being screwed out of my $30 outright.</review>

<review id="9828">I own an iBook G4 laptop and have not been able to download ANYTHING. The software that came with it is useless, both for videos and still images. Since I have iPhoto, I don't need the still imaging software. The files are written in .mod format and iMovieHD is in .avi. Somewhere, I found that if you use iMovie (not HD), you can download them, but we don't want to pay even more money to buy software that we shouldn't need in the first place. My husband owns a PC so we could try doing everything on his computer, but I'm the one with the time to download and edit and I'm the one who takes all of the movies. The clerk at Best Buy, where we bought the camera, told us that this camera would work with Macs. Either he was wrong, or we just haven't been able to figure it out.As for the picture quality, it's quite good. The handling of the machine is easy and the interface is mostly user friendly. But, what's the point of having a good camera if you can't share the videos or keep them.</review>

<review id="9829">These headphones are very comfortable, and seem well made. Unfortunately, the sound quality isnt very good. The bass is too pronounced, and there are virtually no mid-tones.

Just for that, I dropped the rating 2 stars.</review>

I absolutely refuse, however, to buy this stripped down edition.  One of the most celebrated movies of all-time and there are no "special features" or "extras" on the DVD? Surely I'm not the only one who feels this way.</review>

<review id="9831">I purchased this router because it was well rated by CNET and other review sites, but had to return it because it did not function well.Plus: easy setup, great parental controls, fairly good wireless coverageMinus: both the wired and wireless connections dropped intermittenly.

<review id="9833">Same thing happened to me as to another reviewer. I was mixing a small amount of aleady grated Parmesan cheese with breadcrumbs I had just made in the processor, and the blade must have hit a small chunk of cheese and went right through the side of the bowl, putting a hole in it and breaking in half. Scared the heck out of me, breadcrumbs all over the place, and a broken blade and bowl. Would cost me $24 to replace both, so I might as well buy a new one (a different brand, of course!). I'm mostly just glad I didn't get hurt.</review>

<review id="9834">I bought this in October after reading the reviews on Amazon. This is a piece of junk.  It gets dropping connections, the A/C connection keeps popping off, and the blue light at the top is way too bright and distracting.  I would avoid this product like the plague.</review>

Nothing was mentioned about spraying the waffle iron grill as it should be non stick.

The handle is not protected and you get burns from accidently touching it.5.  the grease elimnators (cups) do not catch all the grease.6.

<review id="9839">I bought the 2nd Gen iPod Touch 16-gig to replace my 8-gig previous-gen Nano, needing more storage. Setup with my home wifi was instantaneous, and everything was great UNTIL I discovered it will not charge on my home alarm dock or my JBL dock made for the previous gen Nano. From what I've read, when Apple dropped support for FireWire and went to USB-only charging, a lot of fairly new devices were made obsolete. I got the JBL On-Stage dock just last fall, specifically because my older dock had too low a docking seat to allow use of the wheel on the short, fat Nanos. I spent $300 on this thing and I'm not going out and buying all new docks just because Apple thinks I should; I'm returning it. Don't buy this if you expect it to be compatible with all your docks.</review>

<review id="9840">The product didn't work out of the box. I had to call Linksys 24/7 support and talked to them for 3 hours until we got the problem resolved. But once it was working this device is a beauty. I had an Apple Airport Express which was terrible and had very limited range. The range on this router is incredible and the speeds are great even when many people are connected to it at once. If I had just gotten it to work without having to call customer support I would have given this product 5/5 stars.</review>

<review id="9841">I've had this product 3 months now.  It of course would not install correctly (new Dell with Vista, 64 bit).  After numerous calls got it to work but the speed would drop to 1.0 mps and stay there.  Linksys was no help, but starting working and staying at normal spped.  Was OK for some time at normal speeds.  Now the problem is back, spent 3 hours with linksys tech support today, would not fix the problem unless I paid $10 and guess what, the problem is back 10 minutes after I hang up.  Plodding along at 1.0 unless I power down the router and power up again. Giving up and buying something else tomorrow.</review>

<review id="9842">Mine broke after less than two weeks. it simply stopped working! I didn't drop it or anything!</review>

<review id="9843">We were very disappointed with this router for two reasons.First, it gave us a grand range of maybe 75 feet through one wall.  And at that point the reception was rated "very low" by our IBM ThinkPad laptop.  This limitation made this unit useless for our purposes.Second, we were never able to set it up downstream of our wired LAN switch and able to access the wired network in our home - no amount of "help" from LinkSys's hard-to-understand off-shore support people or fiddling based on LinkSys's FAQs made this work.  As an aside, we were disconnected twice after a very long time of waiting and then trying to explain what we wanted to accomplish.  There just wasn't a lot of savvy in the folks we talked with.  Bottom Line - Beware if you need some reasonable range and if you want to do ANYTHING out of the ordinary.Sorry LinkSys, this one just didn't make it . . . GB</review>

<review id="9845">I received two of these as a gift.  As a first time parent, I thought they looked great for "swaddling for dummies"!  We used one for about two weeks only to discover that our baby (who only weighed 7lb 8oz at birth) was too large for it!  The velcro attaches acress of the chest/arm area even though there is tons of space for growth at the feet.  In order to get it to close, we had to scoot her down and then fold over the extra fabric at the neck.  It kept flipping up and covering her face while she slept.  So, we switched to using the sleep sack we received instead and it worked MUCH better.  Don't waste your money; just swaddle the old fashioned way w/ receiving blankets.</review>

<review id="9846">I have been using Office 2007 Professional on my corporate laptop running XP for a few months now and I must say it is the worst version yet.  It is extremely irritating to me for companies to change so drastically the user interface to the point that you have to totally re-learn the product.  I am working here...don't have time to re-learn staples such as word processors, spreadsheets, and databases.  Jeesh!  Give me a break Microsoft!  In addition, I think it has to be the buggiest version yet.  It is also a huge problem transferring important files to clients who are still on the older versions of Office...that part alone has been a disaster.  If you have time to piddle around re-learning...buy it.  If you have to work for a living...save yourself the money!</review>

A disturbing trend has been taking place in DVDs, in that movie companies &quot;rush&quot; to get a DVD out and then re-release it with additional items a year or so later.  This is incredibly annoying and they're laughing all the way to the bank.  DVD wouldn't be as popular as it is if it wasn't for the extra features...trailers, documentaries, commentaries, etc.  In my opinion, no DVD should be produced that doesn't have these &quot;basics&quot;:  widescreen format, commentary by the director/screenwriter/editor/etc., trailers and at least a &quot;making of&quot; documentary.  By seeming to &quot;atone&quot; for previous releases that lack these items, the companies are making special editions which add these things that should have been there in the first place.  What about all us poor souls who went ahead and got the &quot;rush job&quot;?  You either buy the new release or fume over the knowledge that a better version is out there and you're stuck with an inferior version.</review>

<review id="9852">I still can't believe how neatly everything wraps up for Bella, Edward and all the other central characters (Cullens, Nessie, Jake, even Charlie and Sue!). So much more plot was thrown into this last book (in contrast to the three previous books which mostly crawl at a snail's pace until something finally happens in the last 50-100 pages) but much of the storyline was far-fetched and ridiculous even set within a fictional vampire/werewolf world. I feel ripped off for devoting so much time and energy to a book series with such a predictable "fairy tale" ending. It seemed as if the author just ran out of steam after 700+ pages and could think of nothing more than what was the most obvious. Stephenie Meyer should have delivered a *real* ending and not something so convenient and contrived. The readers deserved something better!!</review>

<review id="9853">3 days of solid all day long tech support leads me to believe this &quot;mac compatible&quot; product is in fact not anywhere close to mac compatible. Got it up and running the first day - but when I attempted to connect a wireless usb adapter from another mac - crash city - the router went down. Same thing after about 37 tries.  Tried every setting known to man, every form of resetting/power cycling/firmware updating - nothing. Maybe this gear will work with another manufacturer, but it will not work with netgear USb adapters or Macwireless USB adapter - which by the way are the only options for those unwilling to spend $3,000,000,000 for the airport cards (thanks a lot apple for pricing wireless products that other sell for 30 bucks at 300 bucks and up). I am fed up with companies that pretend to support platforms but can't get their gear to work even after 2 days (linksys) and 3 day (netgear) of all-day long tech support. I am sure these babies are just &quot;plug and play&quot; for the PC users out there, bu they are a nightmare for us mac users. I will not buy another netgear product - mainly because they outsource their tech support to illiterate morons. There are plenty of illiterate morons here in the US that can at least speak english when we need tech support. Someone please make a mac compatible wireless solution!!!!The lack of mac support out there for alleged &quot;mac compatible&quot; products is about to drive this 30-year supporter of mac - away for good.</review>

<review id="9854">Like an earlier reviewer I think a product like this should work for more than three years (I'd say at least seven.) But I didn't even get three years out of mine. Unfortunately I bought one in late 2001. It was used on a fairly regular basis for about a year and a half. I hadn't used it since 2003. I recently took it out to retrieve some files and it would not work. Plugged it in, CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK WHIRRRR - cannot read disk - LED blinks continuosly. So while it's been more than three years since I bought the unit I'd say I got something like 2 years of normal usage. It's dead now, and I wouldn't dream of spending $120~$175 to replace it. I'm only considering a replacement purchase to be able to retrieve a few of the files. Basically this is an obsolete product with far superior and cost effective alternatives available. If I do find a low cost replacement I will quickly retrieve my data and archive it onto DVDR and resell the unit if I can. In 2001 this drive served a purpose -BFD (before flash drives.) But I wouldn't recommend this technology in 2007.</review>

<review id="9856">The ice cream is delicious, but it takes quite some time for it to set.  The ingredients must be ice cold, so it takes more time than just the mixing to make ice cream.  After mixing, she fould that the mixture needs to be chilled again before it can be processed.  A bigger machine might give quicker results, but for a fun and different cooking experience, it works well.</review>

<review id="9857">I bought the Saitek X52 joystick and throttle when my Microsoft Sidewinder began to wear out.  I intended to use it mainly for massive multiplayer online flight simulators (Aces High II).  While the stick and throttle are very aesthetically pleasing, with a dazzling array of buttons, hats, switches, sliders, and leds, it suffers from a few fundamental design flaws.  The first and most fatal (in the online flight sim world anways) is that the control throws are simply too large.  Whereas a normal joystick (such as the Microsoft Sidewinder) reaches maximum deflection (pulling back on the stick) in one or two inches, the X-52 requires perhaps twice that amount.  The same goes for the throttle.  The simple physical distance required to go from minimum to maximum is just too far.  This translates into diminished reaction times.The second flaw is the tension of the joystick.  First, its very loose.  I would prefer that the spring be twice as strong as it is.  Even better would be a system which increased tension as one pulled farther back on the stick.  But instead, the stick puts forth a very weak and sloppy resistance.  This translates into inadvertently losing control of one's aircraft.  The second part of the tension flaw is balance.  The tension of the rudder is around twice that of the roll and pitch axis.  The entire joystick wants to move when applying rudder pressure, and it is much more difficult to line up for a shot with this unbalanced rudder.One final flaw is that the buttons are to far apart.  I have large hands, and its difficult for even me to reach them all.  And even when I can reach them, they are spaced so far apart that I lose accuracy when deploying ordnance.So in summation, if you enjoy spending time in the competitive online world of combat flight simulators, this is not the stick and throttle for you.  Its really quite a shame, the X-52 is a good looking setup, and it completely programmable.  But the sad fact of the matter is, the X-52 is a downgrade from the range of $40 joysticks on the market today.</review>

<review id="9858">While it looks slick its nothing like the original G-15 which had 18 hotkeys which could be bumped up to 54 through the use of the M keys.  Lets not even talk about the hideous new back lighting or the fact that the LCD screen can not be hidden when desired.  Bring back the old G-15 name this piece of donkey dung something else and I think Logitech will have a lot more happy people buying from them.</review>

<review id="9861">I purchased this item because I wanted to cut the time down that I spend on my hair. I was very excited to receive it and washed and dried my hair that day. Well the first thing I noticed was there is no temperature control as it states in the description. Second, my old conair one(which works amazingly well for only $20), heated up in about a minute. I was expecting this one to be faster so I started on my hair in about half a minute and needless to say it did nothing to my hair. My hair wasn't even hot. So I packed it up to send back when I decided to try again. I gave it plenty of time to warm up so I can't say how long it took(I just left it in the bathroom until I was done with the dishes). So it was really hot and I touched up my hair with it. I can't honestly say it's any better than my conair. I don't know how hot it gets but my conair goes up to 250 degrees and I have to go over my hair at least twice with it. This one's about the same. I'm done with trying expensive straight irons.My conair does the same job as this one. If it's not broke don't fix it!!</review>

<review id="9865">I purchased this food processor to do smaller jobs.  I have used it twice. The first time to simply grate cheese. Simple task, it almost burned the motor out.  The second time I was make a  dip. The chopping blade is now stuck in the processing bowl.  I have the larger 11 cup processor and am very satisified.  Much easier to use and even though it costs more, it has been money well spent. I am in the process of sending this back to cuisinart (not to be replaced).</review>

<review id="9866">This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)      Ok we all have off days our thoughts jumbled you know a yuck moment.Here was mine,I liked everyone that was in the movie but yuck.I have tried to get threw this movie twice and I just can not do it.I would have been better off if I bought the commercials.So this was my moment of shame when I purchased this movie,I will have to live with the shame lol.</review>

<review id="9867">It gets so messy! Cuisinart must have not thought about cleaning when they designed this. It's great that you can have fresh grinned coffee in busy mornings but who has time to clean up such a mess.  Grinded beans spill everywhere between the grinder and coffee maker  which is awfully inconvenient to clean. Also wet coffee beans get stuck all over the machine with steam coming out when coffee gets brewed, so you end up rinsing and drying off the grinder every morning before making coffee because who wants to have  soggy coffee beans contained in the fresh grind coffee beans!!</review>

<review id="9869">This toaster is beautiful... but after owning it for less than a week (using it three times) the left side is no longer functional.  The knob felt loose when we received it, and it now looks to be broken inside.  It's impossible to lock down the toast slots for heating.  The right side toasts reasonably well at the highest settings, but it generally doesn't seem very powerful.  Despite its looks, and the overall sturdy feel of the toaster, the knobs and dials seem very cheap and lightweight.  Sadly, we are returning it for a refund. Update:  We have since purchased a Breville 4 slice (two long slots) toaster, which had been the other model we were considering.  It works very well.  Not as aesthetically pleasing as this Kitchenaid, but solidly built and powerful even toasting.</review>

<review id="9870">I purchased this MP3 player for its price.  I normally listen to audiobooks while workingout in the gym so I am not that concerned about sound quality.  I was disappointed by this player.  It continued to glitch and lock up on my while playing tracks.  I tried to re-copy files and nothing seemed to work.  I decided to return this player and find another brand. I give it two stars for ease of use and size.</review>

<review id="9871">I have been a Turbo Tax user for years. I have read all the reviews that complain about licensing policy and cost. I understand how people feel that software should be free of cost to all. How many use unlicensed or pirated versions of Microsoft Office, Quicken, Nero...Let's get past the issues surrounding business model such as printing or number of returns that can be filed. This product is inferior to Turbo Tax. I am not saying that Turbo Tax is perfect but this product has less functionality. For years I have been able to install Turbo Tax, import prior year returns and in about 30 minutes file my federal and state returns. Tax Cut doesn't allow me to download my W2 or investment data from my financial institutions. I now have to double check my data to ensure that I have fat fingered the data correctly. I do not feel confident that my return is accurate which will require me to spend significantly more time reviewing it. If the amount of time you want to spend preparing your return is a concern and you feel that you purchase the software for yourself and not to run a small family tax service, Turbo Tax is a superior product.</review>

<review id="9872">After FINALLY switching from dialup to DSL in May, 2006 (I was too cheap to pay for cable access so I had to wait for our phone company Verizon to get around to providing service to our house), I was dying to network our laptop so that we could use high-speed internet on both of our computers and so that two family members could be on the web simultaneously.I was a bit concerned about setting up a wireless network because of the number of rooms through which the signal would have to travel to get to where we like to use the laptop. But the DSL was SO easy to set up, and I'm pretty good at software stuff, so I figured - how hard can it be? The Linksys wireless router was quite clear about first running the CD, and about how to connect the various cables. Everything checked out fine UNTIL it tried to find the internet connection. Darn router couldn't find it. I triple checked all my cables, reset and rebooted and redid everything multiple times. Did some swearing. Slept on the problem. Tried again. Finally found the user manual which described about six different types of internet connections. Since I had no clue which mine was because it was written in techiespeak, I tried all of them that might possibly apply. Still no luck. I swore some more. After reading numerous internet reviews, it seemed that many people had had to call tech support to get their initial setup done, and I think that the product should ship with intelligible instructions. After a week or so of nursing my wounds, I decided I should try a different brand of router. Bought a Belkin. Incredibly easy setup directions. Done in a mere few minutes. It found my internet connection automatically, but if it hadn't, there was a lovely typed instruction sheet in the box listing LOTS of DSL providers, including mine, with details for how to configure things. I never needed it, but it was nice to know it was there.So far the Belkin is working just fine and the signal goes where I want it to. Tomorrow I return the Linksys in an attempt to use my paltry personal buying power to lobby for better instruction writing by the Linksys folks.</review>

<review id="9873">I bought the sandisk Titanium while I was in Iraq, it was great. It did everything I neede and then some. I used the U3 site and downloaded lots of cool things. I never got to use them however because the disk fried after about 4 months. a tech told me to go to the site and try to redownload the software as it was corrupt, but I haven't been able to find out how yet, no info on it. Bottom line is the stick was great but it does not last.</review>

<review id="9874">We bought this about 6 months ago and it's been worthless.

<review id="9877">This review is from: Quantum of Solace [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)      If there was any way I could give this film negative stars, I would do it. Casino Royale was one of the best -- if not THE best -- bond movies ever made. Despite some people's criticism of Daniel Craig, personally, I feel that he is the best bond ever to step into the role...perhaps even better than Connery. Now believe me, coming from a major Connery fan, that is high praise.And then, there's this movie. I'm not sure if I could even call it a movie. You see, movies typically have a few components. They have scenes and dialog, which come together to form story and plot. Movies use actors, sets and props to achieve this goal. From what we could tell, this movie did not have scenes, did not have dialog, did not have sets, and perhaps had some props and actors, although one was rarely privileged enough to see an actor on screen long enough to see if he was talking, winking, or throwing us the bird. In fact, in one extremely cowardly "not-scene", bond walks into an elevator escorted by four agents. The elevator door closes, and then momentarily re-opens with the four agents unconscious on the ground, as Bond walks calmly out. Now I don't care if you are a die-hard Bond fan or just a movie fan in general, that is ridiculous. Since when did Bond become an episode of Loony Toons?The reason there are no scenes in this movie is that a scene must involve at least five seconds of contiguous content which is comprehensible to the audience. I do not believe there was a single, contiguous five seconds of film in this entire travesty of a movie. My wife and daughter and I were in the theater during the first scene, which may have been a car chase, and we were looking back and forth at each other with confused expressions. We think the chase ended with someone flying off a cliff (or the top of a building? hard to say). We think there were three cars, except none of us could explain where the third one came from or went to. Shortly thereafter there was a boat chase. Our dialog in our seats during the boat chase sounded something like this.me: "Is that a boat chasing them?"wife: "I can't tell. I think so."daughter: "No, wait, I think it's two boats."me: "Two boats? Are you sure."wife: "..."daughter: "..."me: "...Wait a second, there have to be three boats!"daughter: "why?"me: "Because I think one just exploded, and I still keep seeing at least two distinct boat hulls."wife: "I thought that was the car on the dock that just exploded."me & daughter: "There was a dock???"That pretty much describes the entire movie, beginning to end. Now, I'm an astute moviegoer. I am the one who figures out who the bad guy is in the movie before anybody else does. I'm the one who figures out what's going on, and I was so totally and completely lost in this one that I still don't have even the smallest clue who the bad guy was, who the good guy was, what happened, and what bond was looking for in that burning building at the end. I can't possibly spoil the plot for anyone who reads this review, because there wasn't one. In fact, the only reason I made my wife and teenage daughter sit through the rest of this movie is that I wanted to try to come up with more ammo to use against it when I reviewed it. Unfortunately, there was so little substance to this movie that it didn't even give me anything else to criticize. There just wasn't anything there.Casino Royale was an incredible movie, and probably my all-time favorite Bond movie. Why they got the guys from "The Bourne Steady-Cam-Ectomy" to come work on a Bond movie is beyond me. Weren't Bourne 2 and 3 bad enough to teach them a lesson? Why did they pay a great actor like Daniel Craig to reprise his role, but then hide his face and prevent him from acting for the entire movie? Why would they create a Bond film that was so bad that I would rather watch two straight hours of the Jar Jar Binks scenes from Star Wars Episode I?This is quite possibly the worst movie ever made: not as a Bond movie, but just as a movie in general. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE.[EDIT]Since I have received some comments about talking in the theater, I would like to point out that my wife, my daughter and myself were the only ones in the theater at the time. We saw it near the end of its run, and nobody in our small town was foolish enough to come back and see it a second time. Apparently our town has an average IQ over 70.That said, I hope those who comment on my review will focus on its content rather than the fact that we were talking in an otherwise empty theater.</review>

<review id="9878">Now that I have your attention. I rate this dog brush 4.5 out of 5. When a new to me product comes to my attention I do not rush out to buy it before I can see it or try it or talk to a friend that has one. In the case of the Furminator I was not able to find one locally. But I was impressed with the video demonstrations. After comparing prices at other web site locations I took a chance that it might be worth the investment. Well I don't get piles of fur like in the video but there has been a remarkable reduction of dog hair on our rugs. Our German Shepherd Dog Toby looks better and the vacuum cleaner operator (me) does not have to empty the bag as often.</review>

<review id="9879">I bought this in March 2004. It worked great for the first couple of months. Then started to require a reboot once in a while and eventually stopped working. I called the warranty hotline, after more than an hour of trouble shooting he agreed that the product is  bad and needs to be replaced. However, I was expected to pay for the shipping which was an additional $14.99. The new piece which I got worked for only a couple of weeks before going bad. I do not want to spend another $14.99 for shipping or something being sold at $30. Very bad, I would recommend buying something more reliable.</review>

<review id="9880">According to the box's outside, it's Plug and Play.  So you fork over the cash, take it home, and open the box.  Other than the drive itself, you find nothing but a small, multi-fold pamphlet that hypes the product but tells you zilch about setting it up.  Next, you explore the Seagate website looking for set-up guidance. What a maze!  Increasingly frustrated, you phone Seagate Tech Support (M-F, day hours only mind you), you get put on hold, and when you eventually connect, you get someone who is not that familiar with this particulalr product (yup, happened to me twice in 2 successive days).  One technician told me to download "Disk Wizard" from the Seagate site, and follow its menu (another maze).  Next day, a 2nd technician (whose command of the English language was not that good) advised NOT to use "Disk Wizard", but to use a Microsoft application instead (its name started with an "M")-- for which he would email me the link within minutes.  That was three days ago and I'm still awaiting his email.  In sum, I have a handsome piece of hardware sitting next to my PC that is not user-friendly because the manufacturer has not provided this customer with step-wise guidance for its set-up and use.  Oh, BTW -- neither the box nor the multi-fold pamphlet will tell you this, but the Free Agent cannot be employed to perform automatic backup.  At least that's what I was told by one Seagate technician.  My advice re: the Free Agent: caveat emptor!</review>

<review id="9881">Let me first say I absolute the other books in this series.  I read them all in a matter of days.  I was so excited for to read Breaking Dawn....SPOILERS- This book failed.  It did not feel like the other books.  The chemistry was gone BUT the worst thing that happened was with the character of Jacob- GROSS he imprints on Bella's daughter.  Bella, who he loved, who he kissed, who he wanted to marry, etc BUT then he is decicated to her daughter instead...yuck.  And he no longer felt the intense feelings for Bella anymore.  Jacob could have been imprinted on someone else not a baby- Bells's baby.  Mrs Meyer failed the character of Jacob and in my opinion ruined the series by this book.  Sorry I truly wanted to like this book- I loved the others so much!!!!  I am truly sad this book was written this way.</review>

<review id="9883">When I look back at watching the movie at the theater I am not as bummed out about it if I remind myself it is a B movie.  I just loved the book and was disappointed that some of the character were poorly casted and the scenes cheesy. I am 31 so maybe I am not the target audience but I am sad that this wasnt done right, just didnt do the book justice.  Edward wasnt casted right, yeah he's cute, but he and Bella had no chemistry on camera and that is the whole point of the story.  Hopefully the next movie will be better.</review>

<review id="9884">To preface my remarks, I am a fairly competent computer user who has worked in the high-tech industry. Sadly, after 4 hours of frustration with this hard drive, my advice is simply to avoid it. On two Macs running Tiger and Leopard, I consistently struggled to mount the drive. Once I finally got it mounted, formatting to FAT32 to enable access from both Mac and PC was a nightmare. All of my systems ended up crashing and I still haven't figured out what's going on.I hate to react too strongly because I am quite frustrated at the moment, so I will acknowledge that I may have just received a defective HD. But after reading all of the other 1 star reviews, it seems that I'm not the only person who got a drive that didn't function properly from the beginning. An external HD is perhaps one of the only peripheral devices that absolutely must not die. After all, it's normally backing up important files! I guess the only saving grace is that died straight out of the box rather than a month from now; at least I didn't lose any files like many of the posters.The moral: do some research before buying this drive and make sure SimpleTech has resolved their problems. You may be better off springing for Time Capsule (Mac) or a higher quality drive.</review>

<review id="9886">I will make this as short as I can.  I am a long time user (~10yrs) of MS Office, many versions of both Word and Excel.  When I started having some compatibility issues with my old version, I decided to upgrade.  My advice to you is, at all costs, avoid upgrading if you can.  If you can choose a different product (non-Office), do it.In Word especially, all the old interfaces have been completely redone, from the menus available right to the way help is (dis)organized.  Many of the old usability features, such as templates (for letters), how you interact with colors/fonts/etc., and how you print, preview, and perform simple functions, are gone or changed.Microsoft apparently believes that manuals are a thing of the past, so finding out where my old options are, if they still exist, has been a chore of figuring out which of the dozens of help topics are actually relevant, and if they will help me (which they typically haven't).Even in Excel there have been interface and usability changes that have made it difficult for me to work with it, given my long history with previous versions.  My only caveat is that brand new users may find it easier to work with than old ones, but again, the poor help system would hinder even that, I would think.Best of luck.</review>

<review id="9889">I gave this show a shot and made it through 4 episodes before I had to throw in the towel. Horribly, horribly written. The acting was atrocious.

<review id="9890">I got this camera just before Christmas 2008 and used it only on Christmas day.  Upon viewing video and pictures, I found the picture quality to be totally unacceptable and video quality not very clear and quite a bit jumpy.  I will mention that, after inspecting the camera very carefully, I found a flaw mark or minor scratch on the lens which may have degraded it's best ability to perform optimally. (I returned this camera) The only nice quality is the HD video capture which is a great feature for the future of video cameras to be in sync with newer tv's and computer screens.  Otherwise, it feels to be constructed well other than the poor design of the USB connector which is easily accidentally released at inopportune times.  I somehow must have hit the release button while camera was in the carry case making the camera difficult to remove from cloth carrier.  Overall, I would recommend either buying a higher quality camera for those "special" moments or waiting for the technology to expand and produce better products for around the hundred bucks this camera cost and is only worth at this time.</review>

<review id="9891">I was never a fan of Eclipse and had hoped that Breaking Dawn would recapture some of the magic that I found in the first two books of the series.Sadly, I didn't read the reviews before I purchased the book because I wanted to judge for myself but they were all right and made valid points.I gave the book two stars and not one because without SM, we wouldn't have had Twilight.  However, SM really let the fans down with this book.  Well, speaking for myself- this fan anyway. I agree that she broke some of the rules in BD that she had set up in Twilight. I am not going to ruin the book for those who need opinions without giving the story away. Besides I would just be echoing the sentiments already written. I will go on to say that the novel was poorly written, the characters I once loved-unrecognizable and some of the subject matter just down right repulsive.I didn't mind the fairytale ending because I wanted one, I just disliked how she got there.  BD was asking me to sacrifice the last of the magic I originally found in the series.  So what was the point? We have our fairytale ending but is it a good sign when you finish a book and wonder what the heck you just read and why do I feel tragically short changed?</review>

<review id="9892">This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [HD DVD] (HD DVD)      I was a bit dissapointed because I didnt see that in the first place, this dvd a high definition dvd is. I should have paid more attention on the fact that this is HD DVD. So watch out people, unless you have HD DVD players or you are planning to buy one, dont purchase a HD DVD, because you wont be able to watch this!!!</review>

<review id="9893">Hey you Yo-Yo dieters looking to be on the next trendy diet only to get fatter!  This book disgusts me.  There is no nutritional epiphany, no eating revolution and certainly no education to gain from this book.  Chocolate as you know it from the store has been processed to a point where there is only a fraction of the nutrients from the cacao bean which is a superfood.  Chocolate should not be on any health concerned persons diet.  Egg McMuffins, donuts, cheese, burgers, et cetera...how is this going to save you from heart trouble, high blood pressure, strokes and any manner of health issues.  If you want to lose weight, gain energy and be your physical best I suggest you check out You Are What You Eat by Gillian McKeith</review>

<review id="9894">Unfortunately I managed to break the 1040x (revised tax return). The wrong columns were used and the calculations were incorrect. After reviewing the 1040x created by Taxcut with the IRS, and contacting Taxcut I filled the form out manually. Taxcut promised an update sometime this month.Issues are.1. How did such basic errors on the 1040x get past their Quality assurance team.2. One month to go and Taxcut is still issuing updates, it is not a big  confidence builder.AlsoValuations on charitable deductions seem unusually low compared with Quicken, another hidden cost.</review>

<review id="9897">Replaced my dead WRT54G ver 1 router this weekend with the latest and greatest.........WRONG!  Spent many hours with Linksys Tech support that just wasted my time.  The Version 5 Router still drops the intenet connection two or three times a day and will not automatically recover.  Power resetting it takes care of the problem until the next time.  I've ordered a WRT54GL (Linux version) and am returning mine to Fryes as defective.  I'm really pissed that Linksys Tech Support wasted so much of my time.  I had to learn about the Version 5 problems from the Web and my own personal experience.  Bummer!</review>

<review id="9898">I purchased this unit since it had a large cuff and appeared fairly easy to put on.  While the cuff is large enough for me and my husband, we get more error messages than actual readings.  We can only get the cuff to fit properly on the left arm if the other person does it, and even then we're still getting close to 90% error messages.  It is easier to put on the right arm for some unknown reason, but that arm still gets more errors than readings and most doctors prefer readings from the left.I don't know how much of the problem is with the unit, and how much of it has to do with the shape of overweight arms (wider at the top of the cuff and narrow at the bottom of the cuff, which makes it hard to get it situated *just right*).  So, if you have larger arms, or flabby arms, this may not be the unit for you.</review>

<review id="9900">The idea of the law of attraction is interesting and I plan to learn more about it, as I haven't decided yet whether "I believe."  However, this DVD is a painful piece of crapola -- an infomercial that makes wild claims without more than the merest, barest, tiniest hint of factual support.  It doesn't help, either, that it clearly has aspirations of being the next DaVinci Code.  Ugh.  If you can, borrow this DVD from a friend.  If not, rent it.  If not that, try to buy it used (I can't imagine that there aren't a lot of them for sale).  It was painful to watch -- and that was true despite the fact that I'm *granting* that the law of attraction *may* be true.  Did I mention, "ugh"?  The extra star rating (2 instead of 1) is attributable to the interesting topic, not the way in which it was presented.</review>

<review id="9901">There are many things in the 2009 version that no longer work.  If you have the 2007 version, don't bother upgrading.  For example, when you are in the Pay Bills module, View by Vendor no longer works.  It will show some of the bills due for that vendor (apparently picking a few at random), but not all.  It's completely unreliable. I called Intuit to see if this was a known issue and to see if there was a fix I could download.  Well, they wouldn't even listen to me unless I agreed to PAY THEM a tech support fee to report THEIR problems!!  Why should I have to pay THEM to tell them about a problem with THEIR software???  But wait, there's more!After I refused to pay them to report the problem, I tried to post the problem in their on-line forum.  You have to register as a member of the forum.  Every time I tried to register, the button that completes the process was greyed-out and prevented me from registering.  I then called Intuit and they would not even assist me with registration in their supposedly free forum unless I PAID for technical support!!!This company cares about one thing:  MONEY.  They do not care about putting out a quality product.  They do not care if the software does not work.  A good software company would welcome knowing about problems so that they can fix them.  I have no respect for Intuit or Quickbooks anymore.</review>

<review id="9902">I'm tech savvy and ended up spending hours upon hours network troubleshooting this router ONLY to find out that the problem I was experiencing is KNOWN. My only solution to many of the issues encountered, was to disconnect the firewall (leaving my computer totally exposed, not good). To resolve the issue, I had to update firmware multiple times. After all this, it still doesn't work right. $50 router. $500 in my time to fix it. Note: you get what you pay for.</review>

<review id="9903">so many folks rave about this 'tool' and I still have no idea what they're talking about!  I have two large dogs with lots of hair.  I've tried using the Furminator - tried using it at different angles even, and get little to no excess fur from them.  Using a cheap rake produces much better results in less time.  It gets 1 star because there's no option for '0' star.  I'm $40.+ lighter.  P.T. Barnum was right again.</review>

<review id="9904">Well, what can I say.  This .mod file that they have chosen to use does not tell editing software the aspect ratio, so the videos are always distorted.The software the camera comes with is a joke, and may be ok for the very very light user.Otherwise, if you don't care about better editing, the camera actualyl works very well, great picture, except low light seems to lack behind other models I have tried.</review>

<review id="9905">On the strength of Amazon reviews, I bought this contraption.  It's turned out to be probably the worst appliance I've ever owned.  Toast is unevenly toasted from the front of the unit to the back, and it's all dried out from the convection feature, I guess.  Who needs air blowing across toast when it's toasting?  And the oven!  As you can see from the ad, you can't adjust it to just any ol' temp you want, like you can on any self-respecting oven.  You're forced to use only the temps demented Sanyo engineers dictate, none of which I've never encountered in any recipe.  The timer is screwy, too.  After you set the time, the knob doesn't creep back down to zero like you'd expect.  Instead, little lights indicate the countdown progress, but only in 5-minute increments.  This thing is going out to the trash as soon as I can find a replacement.</review>

<review id="9906">I bought this and put it on my keychain since it has a keyring attached to the flash drive.  I should have known the keyring was flimsy from the thin metal they provide.  It fell off my keychain after a few weeks and I was never able to find it.  I have read other reviews of this product being lost easily too.  If you don't use it as a keychain you should be fine, but another negative is that this flashdrive adds software to your computer while many other brands do not.  For these 2 reasons, I give this product 2 stars.</review>

<review id="9907">From the company that gave us Gilmore Girls and Veronica Mars, comes this piece of trash, which is about a internet blogger who comments about the lives of people in show business.  This is about the most repulsive show on the CW network.  Never mind the acting and the writing which is bad, this is about a group of people who are on their way to both personal and professional self-destruction.  I can see why parents and educational centers across the country have denounced it.</review>

<review id="9908">The controller worked well while it lasted - which was exactly 2 days.  The left analog joystick went haywire and caused movement without even touching it.  All attempts to reset, including reistalling the software failed to correct the issue.  So, like any good consumer, I returned the product thinking I had a faulty controller.  Turned out the second controller acted up even faster - the same day.Don't waste your time on this product.  You'd be better off getting the non-vibrating one.  I've had the non-vibrating gamepad for 4 months now.  Not one single problem to date.</review>

<review id="9909">Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)      This product was a big disappointment. It is a suite of security applications for up to three windows PCs. My biggest issue - and most importantly, is it requires a subscription of 50 dollars a year from Microsoft. The only reason I'm giving this any stars is because: 1) you can't give it zero stars, and 2) it does gather multiple applications in a one-place control panel. With the exception of above, the only "plus" for OneCare is that it does support multiple PCs for the same 50 dollars a year. Still, though, 50 bucks is 50 bucks, and who knows what the price will be like in the future. Folks, please be aware - all these applications are available elsewhere, in one form or another, most for free. See MajorGeeks and GriSoft for instance. I cannot recommend this product. At all. Also, it is packaged in what has to be the most frustrating box to open ever encountered.</review>

<review id="9913">I have been a user of Microsoft Word and Excel since version 1.0 of each, which I purchased in 1987, and a user of Office for Macintosh since the first version, and Office 2008 is the worst by far. Word 2008 and Excel 2008 have more bugs and problems than any previous version I have used. Among the problems with the latest version that I never had with previous versions are disappearing parts of lines in Word; the scroll bar gets hung up; incomprehensible dialog boxes appear at random times telling me of errors that don't make sense, in Word documents and Excel worksheets that I had been using for years in Office 2001 with no problems; the Word document or Excel worksheet suddenly shifts in the document window even when I am doing nothing; the zoom percentage box in Excel frequently shows an incorrect amount; some charts I had created in Excel 2001 got screwed up when I opened them in Excel 2008, even though other charts that were identical except for using a different column of values opened just fine, and it took me longer to fix those screwed-up charts than it had taken me to create them in Excel 2001; Word and Excel 2008 keep showing up in the wrong space in Mac OS 10.5's Spaces, even though Word and Excel 2001 had no problem working with Spaces properly. This version of Office has more bugs than any other software I have bought in the last 20 years.</review>

<review id="9915">Do not waste your time and money on this MP3 player.  I've spent more time trying to get the thing to play all the songs than I have listening to it.  You cannot delete songs on the device--you have to do it on the computer--have fun with that one!  This thing loves to duplicate and will not play all of the songs.  I've had this since the beginning of August and it's already freezing up and it's gone through MANY batteries.  $30 is too much to pay for this, much less the retail price!  All I can say is, if you do buy this thing--good luck!</review>

<review id="9916">I recently bought the TG1 and Sanyo HD1010 and posted a comparison clip on Vimeo.comOverall, I found the image stabilization to be very good, but the video had muted colors and looked less detailed than that from the Sanyo.  Here are some things I really liked about the camera:-built in lens cap-slightly smaller size than Sanyo HD1010-high quality metal body (titanium)-matching case (extra cost)-5.1 audio recording -memory card plays directly on PS3Here are thing I didn't like:-Memory sticks are very expensive compared to SD cards, I found around 4x the cost-The battery life is rather short, only around 45 minutes (vs 120 min).-AVCHD are difficult to edit, can not be easily uploaded to Vimeo or Youtube without first editing on the computer.  Sanyo's MP4 files can be uploaded directly.-No in camera editing ability, can not even join or cut parts of clips-Not able to record at 1080p-No external mic or headphone jack-Touchscreen has small buttons-The menu structure is confusing-No printed manual / comes on CD, I couldn't even find it online.  My Macbook Air has no CD drive.-It sometimes does not save the setting changes if allowed to power down on it's own.  You have to press the power button after you are done making setting changes.-No remote control included.  Makes it difficult to watch clips on the TV unless you have a Sony Bravia TV which can control the camera.-HDMI cable not included.  It uses a mini HDMI cable as well.-HDMI port is not on docking station, Mini HDMI on camera, so you have to plug it in every time instead of just docking it.-No ability to change volume while playing a video on the camera.  You have to exit out and go into a menu to adjust the playback volume.-Playback screen only shows three thumbnails at a time, I couldn't figure out how to show many thumbnails at once.</review>

<review id="9917">Easy setup and works well in my small home.  But don't walk outside.  I am new to wireless networks (Not so with computers in general) but still I am unimpressed with this device  Doesn't live up to their press at all.  As far as I can tell the 40MHZ range is actually less than the 20MHZ range.  In fact I have a Suprer-G T-Link adapter card that works better than the WPC300N Linksys card I bought.  An example of the range is. Router placed in front of a double pane insulated window - range falls off at to 10% at 75" without any other obstructions.  And actually that is the 20MHZ range.  Spent 3 sessions online with the Linksys support people.  They couldn't sort it out.  So I returned it for a replacement which operates the same.  Also some weird things have happened to the first one like the time on the logs setting itself to the year 1970 for half a day the other day.  The transmit power fades out allot for no apparent reason.  But since I have no experience with this I don't know how bad this device is or it all of them are crap.  This one may go back too if the bugs continue.</review>

<review id="9920">I read the many reviews of this Yoke describing the problem with the 'phantom key press' issue. I also saw the note on Amazon's website that indicated the problem was fixed.  Based upon this, I went ahead and ordered the Yoke as a Christmas present for my 15 year old son.  To make a long story short, the Yoke is GREAT but it was still afflicted with the "phantom key press'. It is most frustrating to have the screen view change or other unexpected things happen at any time. Do not buy this Yoke until the manufacturer can totally guarentee the problem has been fixed.</review>

<review id="9925">There is only one speed, which is really strong and empties the water tank way too quick. Basically the tank holds enough water to last about 5 seconds. If you accidentally push on the top half of the item while holding it water spills out at the center of the device. In addition the product is too big and bulky for the average woman's hand. It is hard to direct the water flow in your mouth and hold it at the same time. What a mess it can make, water was everywhere.</review>

<review id="9927">I have been using straighteners for awhile.  Started with regular drugstore brands and finally bought a 2 inch chi turbo (purchased online).  I've had the 2 inch chi turbo for over a year, and I still am very satisfied with it.  Recently I had a short haircut, so decided to get a chi 1 inch.  Initially I ordered the regular chi 1 inch.  After receiving it and trying it a few time, I was pretty dissatisfied.  The flat iron feels very cheaply made, the light flickers, the handle bars feel flimsy.  I took out the turbo and compared the two closely.  Turns out the regular chi is made in China vs. the Turbo version is made in Korea.  All in all, I returned the chi 1 inch, and ended up finding a turbo chi 1 inch at Target.  I would definitely recommend the turbo version, the quality is just different.</review>

<review id="9928">*spoilers*I was disappointed by Eclipse. For those who are rabid fans of the series, it can do no wrong. For those who are a tad more critical of their reading experience, the Twilight series seems to garner heavily mixed reviews. I enjoyed Twilight a great deal, and New Moon, while not without its flaws, was still really fun. Eclipse just left me scratching my head. Eclipse brings Bella and Edward back into their endless loving embrace - all these two need is each other, apparently, to be happy. But Meyers throws in a fairly predictable if nice monkey wrench in the form of Jacob Black who, as we all now know, is a werewolf. And, I might add, in love with Bella. The story concerns the ongoing legend and relationship of the "cold ones" (vampires) to the werewolves ("dogs", as Edward and his kind call them, or, occasionally, "mongrels") and vice versa. Jacob and his pack of adolescent werewolves play a key part in this story which revolves heavily around Bella's annoying damsel in distress role. Not only does Meyers fail to give Bella anything like some chops (karate classes, maybe??), but apparently she is the central focus for the entire werewolvian/vampiric world. She's now being pursued by Victoria, whom fans will remember from Twilight as a nasty mate for the very nasty James. There is a lot going on in this story - a love triangle is established, backstory for the werewolves is established, and Bella's intense desire to have Edward change her into a vampire is now a focus, as her high school graduation and 18th birthday all occur within this book. But the book is so damned tedious - the action so sparsely distributed - that it really only came alive, for me, in a few places. I read it mostly to just get it over with - it doesn't have the magic of Twilight or the almost giddy quality of New Moon, where I couldn't wait for the reunion of Edward and Bella to occur. I had a hard time liking Eclipse. While this is still a good series, I think Meyers failed to make this one entertaining. It was more like stifling, frankly.</review>

<review id="9931">The B60 was a Christmas gift to my husband and I from my Dad.  We have used an 'old fashioned' coffee maker for many years, but were excited to receive this as a gift b/c we would never spend that kind of money for a coffee maker and my Dad loves his.  We got it home, hooked it up and it works great, BUT I enjoy/need multiple cups of coffee through out my day. (I'm a stay-at-home Mom) My husband thinks it's 'neat' which it is, but I think it's wasteful and a hassle.    I also have a problem with the amount of coffee/tea/water, it gives you.  I think the cup sizes are not enough, which in turn causes you to buy more pods.  I also enjoy drinking tea in the evenings. I have tried the Celestial Seasoning's pods and do not enjoy them.  This might be good for the 'one cupper,' but not the avid coffee drinker.</review>

<review id="9933">I very much looked forward to viewing this movie. All of the reviews made it seem sweet and cute. However I was disappointed to find it is only more preaching of the politically correct. And further disappointed to see that the only negative reviews revolved around the way the dvd worked. Come on people!! When are we going to see that we are being led down a path of Hollywood and Disney's choosing.</review>

<review id="9934">It seems to me that this show barely qualifies as science fiction. It's a dreary & depressing, slow moving show with no humor (Star Trek had for example, the McCoy-Spock interaction).  It seems a large part of the episodes are  the characters standing around having banal conversations. The action is a very small part of each episode.The show has none of the exotic feel that we look for in Sci-Fi. What I always loved about sc-fi was the fantasy ans sense of wonder and amazement it created. This series has none of that. There is a total lack of imagination. The Cylons seems to be no different than humans. There is nothing eerie or scary about them at all. They also look like us, dress like us, talk like us, act like us.  Why bother with Cylons- they may as well be a band of renegade humans? One of the Cylons has a baby- yet the Cylons are referred to as "mere machines"- but this inconsistency is never explained! There is no indication that the humans are from a different civilization than ours. They also look like us, dress like us, talk like us, act like us. They even wear neckties! Sci-fi fans look foward to exotic alien environments. However, every planet they visit looks like Earth.   The show does not make  even a minimal effort in this regard. Maybe its the lack of a special effects budget. Please, at least when they are on a planet in another galaxy, at least once, show a second moon or a second sun, etc in the sky!  The special effects, in general, are nonexistent- The Battletar Galactica is a piece of junk- they use wired telephones!! Not even cellphones- I understand its an old ship, but please, it looks like something from the 19th century! Why would a ship that can travel at warp speed use wired telephones?!?  The acting is terrible - the President is a whiny women who always looks like she is on the verge of crying and often speaks in an annoying whisper. James Olmos never changes his facial expression.  There is a reliance on irritating gimmicks- Balter is constantly talking to a women who no one else can see. i find this extremely irritating.   Also, they make no attempt to even explain this. There is a total lack of background. No explanation as to how the Cylons came to be, why they attacked, what sort of civilization the humans have, their level of technology, their culture, etc.   There were whole episodes about a Presidential election. I can watch The West Wing for politics. I dont need it on a sci-fi show set it another galaxy!  There is a running ridiculous theme about the Cylons and God, but of course, this is never explained.  I would strongly recommend Firefly for those looking for real science fiction.

<review id="9935">I should have stopped after Twilight.  Curious to see if the story could improve from boring to interesting- I bought this one.  It was a BIG stretch to believe in the author's presentation of a vampire and a human having a romance.  Then- it just went to far to throw in the idea that the human loves another guy who is also a werewolf. And all that goes with the supposed war between the two - vampire vs werewolf.  Ah, it's all so BAD! The writer chooses to have faith in the readers ability to believe in the concepts- yet doesn't sell them well enough for anyone to do that.  Spare yourself- spend time on better book than this one.</review>

<review id="9936">A fine example of how fickle or intimate (I prefer the word intimate) scent is to each of us. This is one fragrance that I have not gotten to like. Received as a gift more than a year ago, the bottle still has three-quarters. It does have a `rich' scent but I find it to be too confusing and indescribable a scent, not educing a one word description like `sporty', `sexy', `alluring'. I don't wear it very often but I don't recall a single occasion of `what fragrance are you wearing?' with this one. It's just not my cup of tea so definitely, if you're not familiar with this scent beforehand; do not buy before trying it out at a department store for a day. Why Buy? As a gift for the guy competing for the female that is currently in your crosshairs. As a gift for your boss - you will know he's coming from a mile away. You need a gift for a guy who couldn't pour water out of a boot even if there were instructions on the heel</review>

<review id="9937">There weren't many options for 1000TC single ply sheets under $100 so I thought I'd give these a try.  I knew based on reviews that they were going to wrinkle easily and felt I could live with that.  The problem I have is that these are horrible for 1000TC.  I've had sheets that were 500 or 600 TC that felt better than these.  I followed the washing and drying instructions.  Its been 3 months since I've had them and they haven't gotten any softer.  They feel more like 300TC.</review>

<review id="9938">I've been working with wireless routers since my first Beadlenet, seemingly a lifetime ago.  I recently decided to upgrade my WRT54GS with the 610, primarily for the N band, but also because the 54GS kept requiring a reboot about twice a day.  The 610 is my fifth Linksys router, and I have been a reliable Linksys customer - all my adapters are Linksys, every router (since the Beadlenet) has been a Linksys, and I honestly never even looked at D-Link or the others.  That has now changed.First, LELA (their Easy Link Advisor) caused a lot of problems.  After going though it numerous times, it would just stare at me at the end of setup with "Cannot connect to router".  OK, on to manual setup - no big deal, I've done this probably a hundred times or more.I was able to finally get connected.  With the router in the exact same place as my old one, my range on the 2.4Ghz band was well under half of what I was getting before.  The router is in the basement, which with the 54GS allowed me to go anywhere even on the second story.  Now, I cannot go to even the first story, nor can I go to the other end of the basement.  Note that this is with the 2.4Ghz band, same as before.  I've also successfully connected to the 5Ghz band, but that is even more limited; anything beyond the next room and I'm out of luck.  I tried moving the router around - first floor, second floor, etc. - with no good results anywhere.  The range is just severely limited compared to the older Linksys products.Finally, being a glutton for punishment, I decided to try the USB storage.  Keep in mind I work on computers and networking for a living.  After 6 HOURS of setup, I could not reliably access the disk.  Sometimes it would work, sometimes it wouldn't.  Upgrading firmware did not solve this problem, nor did calls to Linksys.I returned the router, tried another, with the exact same results.  I suspect they have a significant problem with these internal antennas; Linksys is more than aware that their range is limited, but they prefer the sleek, "sexy" look over actual functionality.  That's just too bad and will prove their undoing.I am returning this unit and shopping for another brand.  I've finally had enough with Linksys.</review>

<review id="9939">I bought it and it worked right for some time. After a couple of hours, it starts making scratchy, distorted sounds in the background of the song really screwing the experience up. Some tracks just carry the noise throughout. This is a prob i've experienced with chinese MP3 CD players but this is a first on memory devices.I have returned my Purchase and suggest that others try another model of SANSA or go for an ipod shuffle. Saves you the effort of buying, returning and/or following up on the refund.</review>

<review id="9940">I received this camera yesterday 8/7 and by today 8/8 it will not record anything.  Once I turn on the "on" button the Flip Video logo pops up on the screen and sits there, not allowing me to record nor turn off the device until I take the batteries out.  So I have not been able to record anything and when contacting Pure Digital (the manufacturer) they said this was a common defect and would replace it.  I told them to forget it.  Why replace a lemon with a newer lemon as if you can get newer than 24 hours of ownership....very disappointed.  The positive is the size, it is about the size of a digital camera or cell phone.  I'm not sure if it works with the computer as I was never able to make a video to test out on the computer or software.</review>

<review id="9941">After reading rave reviews of this box on epinions and amazon.com, we purchased one (the large size) and found that the box had more problems than solutions.  The reviews on amazon touch on some of the problems we have had, such as breaking plastic snaps, litter sneaking out through the seams as you roll the box, litter sticking to the sides and bottom, and trouble with maintaining just the right level of litter to solve the problems, etc.  We tried one of the reviewer's suggestions of adding bolts and wing nuts to secure the top while rolling, but since the sifting mechanism cannot accommodate loose stools or stuck urine, you're going to need to take the top off frequently and more easily than can be done once it's bolted.  We currently have three additional conventional covered litter boxes in use which, used with the right litter (World's Best--great stuff!), are much easier to clean than this one, and don't require the extra floor space to "roll" them.   We bought the box through RadioFence.com and called to ask if their "money back guarantee" ("If you are dissatisfied with any product for any reason") would apply here but of course it would not if the box has been defecated in.  (how else would you know if it works?)  DO NOT BUY THIS BOX IF YOUR CAT SUFFERS FROM IBS or ever has any kind of diarreah or loose stool--it will stick all over the grate and get inside of the mechanism.  Our five indoor-only cats are all very clean, and some of them just didn't want to use this box, possibly because of the sifting mechanism taking up so much of the interior.  In the end, the box takes up more room to operate, makes more mess, and is more difficult to clean than regular boxes so we are just going to have to take the loss ($44.99 with mat on RadioFence.com) and buy another regular box to replace this one.Bottom Line:More hassle to clean than scooping of conventional box.  Requires floor space to perform "roll."  Top breaks off when rolling, must be taken off to clean out what sifter misses, such as soft stools and urine that get stuck.</review>

<review id="9942">I purchased this product because of the price, the size of the hard drive, and the Canon brand.  My previous device was a Sony Mini DV and the video quality seems to be better.  I chose not to go with a Sony this time because I didn't want to be hostage to the Memory Sticks.Here are my complaints:1.  No viewfinder.  Granted, they are hardly used these days.  But a viewfinder saves battery life.  You'd have to upgrade to the 120GB HG21 for the viewfinder.2.  Does not save in formats that are compatible with Windows, i.e., .AVI, .WMV, or even .MOV.  You have to install the [included] 3rd Party software to view the video.3.  Video quality playback on my computers were grainy and choppy.  Yes, I'm aware that the it also depends on the type of video card, amount of RAM, and even processing speed.  I have 2 high end gaming machines, one of which is less than a month old with a HD video card.  Both machines show the same poor quality video.  I even checked to see if there were any software updates.  No help.4.  Transferring video files to the computer requires that you plug the unit in.  I would be willing to pay a few hundred dollars more for a device that would address the above.  Too late for me...not too late for you.</review>

<review id="9943">It worked great for the first month I used it, about 4 days a week.  Everything worked fine, with the exception of some water that would drip down the side.  Then after about a month the egg side stopped working, I kind of forgot about it and tried it again this morning and no matter what (unplugging, resetting etc) it would not work.  Very disappointing.I'm going to try to get a replacement, or maybe a refund since it is so new.  Just a note, I've had an egg steamer/poacher separate unit for about 2 years and make 7 hard boiled eggs a week with it and it works without fail, I just wanted to have this unit because of the "muffin shaped" egg for sandwiches.</review>

<review id="9945">This camcorder does not come with the cables necessary to transfer the image to your computer. And don't bother with buying a USB cable, since the images turn out awful.

<review id="9946">I wanted to use TurboTax but had a question first.  I could not find the answer to my question online and called the "customer service" number.  I got someone in India or Pakistan who I could barely understand.  She was also rude.  She had no clue as to what I was asking, which should have been a relatively straightforward question about the software.  She then transferred me to another number where I was on hold for 20 minutes before hanging up.  In other words, they have no customer service.  You are basically on your own.  I called H&R block, spoke to someone in America, and was helped immediately.</review>

<review id="9947">I read this book in a total of three days, right after I finished New Moon, and I am extremely disappointed.  Most of the book was very slow.  It was difficult to find something that was interesting and not stupid.  I apologize for being so harsh, but the plot really bothered me.The main plot of this book revolves around a love triangle between Bella, Edward, and Jacob.  It just got ridiculous.  Sure, Meyer added in a newborn vampire fight and kept Victoria around, but that hardly made up any of the story.  It was clear that the author's main focus was the love triangle.  I liked some parts, like finding out about the third wife, the newborn battle, Rosalie, and Jasper, but overall it was just difficult to get into the story.  The main characters all go completely downhill in this book.  Bella is still annoying and whiney as ever.  She has made no character developments and her praise of Edward is really starting to get quite old. Then we have Jacob who becomes a manipulative jerk.  I understand that he cares about Bella and doesn't want her to make the wrong choice, but in the end it is up to her.  If he truly cared about her, he would have calmly explained to her why he thought she was making a mistake, and then let it be.  But no.  Instead, he acts like a jerk, forces himself on her, and then tricks her into making out with him.  How horrible.  And then Edward.  Oh boy.  Not only is Edward just a complete bore in this book, he is scary and stalkerish!  Alice sees Bella heading off to La Push in a vision, so Edward disables her truck!  And then he is just sitting in there like a creeper when she tries to start it (very stalkerish)!  This was completely unacceptable, yet Bella still leaves her window open for him later that night!  What is wrong with her!  And then when she did make it out to La Push the first time, Edward is following her in his car as soon as she leaves (again, very stalkerish)!  This also creeped me out.  And then he has Alice kidnap her ...what is wrong with him?!  That move was creepy, psychotic, and stalkerish.  I understand that he is worried about her and is trying to be protective, but that is going too far and it is creepy.  And then Bella just forgives him for all of this creepy and unacceptable behavior!  She doesn't even tell him off once!  Why doesn't this girl have a backbone.  It is just silly how Edward can do no wrong.  It makes the story boring, predictable, frustrating, and makes both Bella and Edward look like mary sues and gary stus.  Edward and Bella's relationship has become perfect to the point of boredom.  They aren't interesting to read about anymore because we all know what will happen.  Everything Edward does is perfect.  He can do no wrong.  End of story.  Like I said, the main characters all went downhill completely.Bella and Edward are finally together.  Bella finally made her choice and got engaged to Edward, but not without destroying the magic of the characters and the relationship.  Bella should have never fallen in love with Jacob.  There is no excuse.  This just proves that Bella is still too young and too immature to decide who she really wants to be with.  What was the author thinking here?  It makes no sense.  I get that she wanted to emphasize Bella having to choose a side in this book, but she did not have to have Bella fall in love with Jake.  It could have stayed friendship.  Also, the whole imprinting thing with the wolves was weird and a bit creepy (a two year old!?!?  Ish!!!)  Overall, this book was a huge disappointment.  It just dragged on and on about Bella's conflict over Jacob and Edward.  With the dull plot plus the dull characters, this book is almost impossible for me to like.  I understand that the book is fiction, but it was really frustrating to see the characters fall apart like that.  I became attached to them after reading the first two books in the series, and to see them become complete idiots almost makes me want to cry.  Where was the epic love story I fell in love with?  This felt like a bad daytime soap opera between a bunch of messed up mythological creatures.  I'm very upset.</review>

<review id="9949">The router is very reliable but the surfing is too slow when other clients are on the network. The range is also not good.

<review id="9950">I have to say that this is one of the worst book-to-movie cross overs I have ever seen. I almost walked out of the theater. I'm not sure if the producers or screen writers even BOTHERED reading the series, because beyond the names of characters, there being vampires involved, and some of the same lines, it barely followed any of the key scenes in the book (when they weren't busy inventing scenes that never occurred, that didn't save them any time plot wise anyhow). The actors varied between overwrought and absolutely wooden, the music was distracting at all the wrong moments, and just generally the movie seemed badly timed.  They didn't have a large budget for the movie, and it shows.And I wish someone would've given Kristen some cold/allergy meds - she mouth breathes throughout the entire movie with her mouth hanging open. I understand the need to show she's "intensely feeling" - which they show a lot of when they could have been showing something like, I dunno, stuff relevant to THE PLOT - but her mouth should've been closed at SOME point in the movie. Hopefully they put more effort into the next movie, but from the sound of the rush job they're putting on it, I seriously doubt it.</review>

<review id="9952">We bought the Pro 600 in 2004, as a "splurge" to replace an older, smaller (but reliable) KA. Right away we noticed the annoying, high pitched whine so many have mentioned. We also noticed lighter-weight bowls, beaters, just not the same quality as our old KA (the "pro" model of its time, in 1988). After not quite 4 years (compared to the nearly 20 the old machine lasted), the gears have abruptly stripped and the machine is completely shot. We would argue with KitchenAid about replacing it, even though it is out of warranty -- except that we have not the slightest desire to have another of these "new" (and cheaper!) Kitchenaids. We will look to more professional grade kitchen equipment for our next mixer. These are high-priced "gadgets" indeed if they're only going to last a few years...</review>

<review id="9953">This review is from: Transformers (DVD)      Okay, to begin, I enjoyed the Transformer toys and cartoon as a child but was much more of a D&D and fantasy fan than the whole robot thing. So I did watch the cartoon and I knew the major players in the Transformer universe. Like many of the other reviewers, I recongize that Michael Bay is a pox on humanity. He could turn the most epic, heart stopping work of fiction into a "babes and blast" fest. Even in a Vin Diesil or Van Damme film, there is still something of a plot and dialogue. In this, the viewer literally lives from one moment of action to the next because 1) the characters are flat and one dimensional 2) the dialogue is either hideous or nonexistent and 3) I don't think anyone was even trying to make this into anything more than a big screen video game. If that's what you want, then mazel tov and go for it.   What's wrong with the characters? Well, I thought the robots were cool and they had much more personality than the humans, and I'm sure for the fans that should be enough, but I actually like to see more than just special effects when I pay an arm and a leg at the cinema. This film follows the standard classic little worm turned screenwriter scenario: dorky guy falls for the hottest girl in school, but she likes wealthy and/or athletic equally hot guys (for this, of course, the chick is portrayed as being shallow, but why is Shia not equally shallow? After all, he didn't chase after Fox because he loved her poetry. Note to young people: shallow guys=normal, shallow chicks=heartless shrews). What is Shia to do? Look for an equally dorky but nice girl and love her for herself? Hey, we're in a Bay film. There literally are no even average looking women (I'm dead serious. The computer chick looks like a young Rachel Hunter. And I'd like to ask about the name "Fox"; do you actually have to be hot to be issued that name because I have yet to see an unattracive Fox in the media). Look, I don't have any problem with hot chicks. In fact, I'd love it if the American media were more like European and allowed topless scenes on television and such, but could Bay use something other than Playboy for his female casting? And to Shia: God, that kid annoys me. Always has, always will. He is supposed to be the little heart of gold guy for whom we all rote, but his schuckiness constantly comes through, and you can see exactly the jerk who you know he really is. He's extremely bad looking, has little talent, and his voice causes me pain. The rest of the humans ranged from unbelievable (the model who happens to be the top computer programmer in the world), over used stereotype (the funny black guy hacker,hot chick mechanic), and the grating (the FBI agents, the cutesy parents). Of course, for sheer annoyance, Shia takes the crown again. If you can watch this film on mute and fast forward through all the human stuff then raise the film up to five stars because the robots and the fight scenes were really good. Yes, they modernized the cars and such for today's audience, but it's still pretty true to the classic robots. One thing I must ask, philosophically, to the Transformer audience: if the All Spark created all Tranformer life, then who created the All Spark? Theists have this same problem with the question of God, and I think there's even more of an issue of this with AS. Overall, humans and dialogue=1 star; Transformers themselves=5, so decide for yourself if it's worth seeing.</review>

<review id="9955">I liked Twilight, I completely forget what happened in New Moon...oh wait...I do. It was 300+pages of a teenage girl being completely depressed and so melodramatic because her immortal vampire boyfriend left her. I started reading Eclipse and realized I hated Edward. Was it the fact I don't want Bella to waste her life just to be with this guy? That I just don't like him. Or the way he just about had her asking his permission to use the bathroom. A little of all I think. I just can't finish this book. I skimmed the end, just so I could know what happened without actually having to subject myself to it. I never really felt close to Bella's character. I know the basics, parents are divorced, she hates her car, is torn between to mythical creatures, and has no aspiration whatsoever. SM needs to give Bella a little more drive and a little less damsel in distress. After Rosalie's talk with Bella, I expected her to come to her senses and realize she's giving up too much for him. I also noticed the author seems to like to point out the fact Edward looks like a model. I need a little more than liquid amber eyes and pale skin. The only emotions he seems to exhibit are anger, overprotectiveness and just plain no emotion. Talk about the strong silent type. Ever heard of laughing Eddie? One other thing. Charlie. It was pretty weird when he was laughing at the fact that his daughter broke her hand after punching her friend. Who just happens to be after her. I think I need to stop before I explode with annoyance. Bottom line-The book needs a thicker plot besides cowering in fear of some deranged vampire and planning when to get the life sucked out of you (literally) by your boyfriend. I may of may not see the movie. It depends if I still would rather watch the Disney Channel than reading this book. If you like it? Good for you and SM. I'm just not the kind of person who likes vampire novels. And shallow characters.</review>

<review id="9958">We were extremely disappointed in the performance of this very high priced product after looking at the demo video, photographs of pets lying on mountains of their own fur allegedly removed with a FURminator shown on the product's website and TV info-ads. We tried it exactly as instructed on all of our animals: one large medium-haired yellow lab dog, and four cats ranging from medium to long haired. The FURminator removed hardly any fur from any of them. After using the FURminator, we then brushed each of them with our old "Pet Select Soft-Touch Combo Brush" we got at WAL-MART for only $4.94. In each instance, the inexpensive WAL-MART brush removed several times more loose fur from each animal than the FURminator did. We packed up our over-hyped, over-priced FURminator and sent it back for a refund.</review>

<review id="9959">I read all these reviews and decided to buy this chopper.I have absolutely no complaints about performance.It chops and purees most things.I also like the way it handles.

I also picked out all the particles with a toothpick. Then I would wash it in hot water and soap. I would let the unit dry completely before putting it back together and storing it in my cupboard.But that didn't stop the black mold from growing!!!This is such a shame because I really liked using this product.</review>

<review id="9960">Wow, I've been waiting for BREAKING DAWN to come out forever....and when it does....all I want to do is close the book.Stephanie Meyer created a whole plot line in the last three books and completely destroys it with this 'novel.' Pregnant? Pregnant?! I have read plenty of fanfiction and always skipped over the pregant bella stories just because it was so out there. The ones I did read were way better than what Stephanie Meyer gave us.Part One and Part Three were...umm. VERY disappointing.It is almost as if the author had a few ideas but didn't know what to write. She lost connection with Bella as a character...big time and seemed like she had major writer's block.And Nessie? The names are very uncreative. She combined Esme and Renee together....and I HATED how Jacob imprints on Bella's child. It is also not cool how we are introduced to the 'immortal children' concept. I am an avid fan....but this was a poor bk, writing wise. My only fav. part was ironically the one in Jake's perspective. This book seems like it's a first draft. Not a final copy.</review>

<review id="9963">This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)      TRASH!!! This REALLY DESERVES a ZERO!!!!! I love Tim Burtons Batman. They were very artsy and DARK & just great. Joel did an OK job and despite the fact that Batman is not BLONDE (Val Kilmer) i was still able to watch the horrific Batman Foeever and Batman & Robin because it was silly brainless campy fun. I went into Batman Begins thinking its great that Batman is dark again. But walked out the theater feeling it was missing something. I gave Batman another chance with the Dark Knight and after watching the new movie i finally realized what that missing certain something was. It was that Nolan made Batman into a COP film. Theres a difference between a COP film & a Super Hero film. And please dont tell me Batman is a cop because he is a detective etc and that he is not a super hero because he has no magic powers. I already GET THAT!! The bottom line is the movie was AWFUL. If i wanted 2 see a COP film i would go ahead and RENT HEAT with Robert DeNiro. On top of that i hate the freakin BATMAN COSTUME. The ears are so close together i kept thinking they were gonna touch each other. On top of that Bale puts on some AWFL Italian Brooklyn accent everytime he is in the Batman Costume!!! I asked everybody that saw this movie and they still have no idea what the asian guy was going to do with the money or his purpose in the film or why he even wanted the money. They have no idea what that subplot was about. JUST AWFUL on every ASPECT!!!!!!! AWFUL!!!!! Almost 2 1/2 hours of my life i will never get back!!!!!</review>

<review id="9965">I used to have a Saitek USB Gold, which is non-force feedback, and I was quite happy with it. Then I decided to get a force-feedback stick, and that was a mistake in itself, because these things don't really work very naturally in flight sims. That could be a matter of taste, of course, but what is not a matter of taste is that this joystick has some sort of auto-calibration, and that thing just doesn't work well. I fly for a couple of minutes, and then start noticing that it becomes difficult to bank to the left, and too easy to bank right. If I go to joystick properties, I see that the calibration is lost. Fix it, but after a few minutes the same happens. That renders the device pretty useless. I bought it in a far corner of the world, where warranty concept doesn't work like you would expect, so that was some money thrown out the window.</review>

<review id="9968">I got this CHI to replace my old one (which still worked pretty good) for this new one. I loved it and used it all the time and I noticed that it worked better than the old one. But then I was REALLY upset when I made a discovery.The thing broke after only a couple of weeks. Not like stopped working, but the heat panels that straighten your hair were coming off from the base. I realized this while I was using it and my hair slid under the panels and burned my hair. After that it was just came right off at the slightest touch. Thank goodness it was only one small section where it would go unnoticed. I plan on returning it the first chance I get. And if my replacement does the same, I will probably not purchase this one ever again.I love CHI but this particular straightener was of poor quality. And to me, quality overflashes quantity.</review>

<review id="9970">I'm buying another backup hard drive because my last Seagate started clicking and stopped working after about 2 years. I gave it credit for lasting that long and decided to stick with Seagate.  This one arrived and was broken upon delivery - again with the clicking noises.  I already lost all my data and backups once from a broken Seagate, not sure I'm ready to lose any more.  Too many breaks for the lower price.</review>

<review id="9974">I would have given this book one star except that I thought the history of vampires and werewolves was very creative. I can't tell you how disappointed I was with this third book...I have read the other reviews and their concerns were also swirling around in my head. Bella is immature and impulsive, not a great combination. I agree that she isn't a very attractive character -- she is so snarky, why would you ever do anything for her, she appreciates absolutely nothing.Jacob is creepy with a capital C. He's supposed to be a teenager in love but he is the worst kind of boy I ever met in highschool. By Bella's own admission, he forced himself on her twice and then he threatens to kill himself if she doesn't kiss him??!! What message are we sending Young Adults here? I practically gagged when she goes from feeling threatened by him to happily giving in to kissing him...are we engaging in rape fantasies marketed toward 15 year olds? Gross.I have a different take on Edward though. I absolutely agree that he tries to control every possible thing for her and that gets really old. But he is the only one who truly seems to have a reason to hang onto her--his attraction to her is her scent. SM made a huge deal about his inability to keep away from her because of it. So I get that part of it BUT his go-off-and-kiss-other-guys-and-I'll-be-here-when-you're-ready attitude is so lap dog, I can barely stand him as a character either. My other comment about him is that he is almost forced to micromanage her activities because she is so accident-prone, stupid, impulsive. Ugh, my eyes are rolling to the back of my head just thinking about how weak a character she is.SM writes incredibly well for scenes between Bella and Edward and if she feels that these two are soul mates for each other, let's make them more stand alone characters that choose to be together as they were in the first book. Sure they can have a sweeping love affair and pine for each other but they still have to have lives, and you know, DO STUFF! And keep Jacob as the buddy who keeps his dignity by not trying to rape Bella. In fact, let's give all of these characters their dignity back, maybe she will in book four...I wish I would have stopped reading after the first book as someone else suggested.</review>

<review id="9975">I bought this fountain because my cat loves drinking running water and for the first couple of months I loved it.  It would have to be refilled constantly but I didn't mind because my cat was deliriously happy with it.Then the leaking started.  Just a small dribble out the side so I cleaned it (which I did every week anyway) to no avail.  The leak kept worse and worse and made my kitchen floor a mess.  I had only had it four months and was pissed!  My story is by no means the only one.  My friend had the same thing happen to her after about 6 months.  Just don't waste your money.</review>

<review id="9976">I can't really write much of a review on whether the product works or not.  It smells so bad I have to disguise it in something to get the dog to eat it.  Usually try to get the powder into some cheese or meat in order for her to swallow it.  Sprinkling it on the food is just a waste of food because she won't get near it. Maybe someone has a good tip on how to get it into the dog!</review>

<review id="9977">I was really anticipating the release of this book, and I was so excited to start reading it, but I was extremely disappointed when I was finished. I was really upset about Jacob being so obnoxious in the book and trying to ruin everything. Also there were quite a few chapters that were very slow and didn't really relate to much of anything. I think this book had way to many themes going on as well. Hopefully Breaking dawn will be better, but I will not be counting on it.</review>

<review id="9978">I love my Zoji rice cooker, so when it was time to get a new coffee pot, I decided to get this conundrum. It is a mix of really great things and really dumb things.Great :Makes a large pot of hot good tasting coffeeI can tell already that the pause and serve will not break anytime soon unlike every other pot I have ownedEasy to put in coffee and water, if you don't use the stinking carafe for water (see below).Unbreakable CarafeAwful :I read all the reviews about how the lid to the carafe shreds hands so I screwed it on loosely and it still was locked solid after it heated up. Turns out you only close it when you want coffee not to pour, you can leave it a few turns loose at all times... so OK, but I cut my hand on the damn thing.The stinking pour spout is so small that it takes 30 seconds to pour a cup of coffee. I tend to unscrew the cap and dump coffee out of the big opening. This is nearly unacceptable.Size 3 filters (got scissors?) I was warned, but my leftover 4's don't fit very well after cutting them.The clock and controls feel cheap which is so unlike my rice cooker although now that I think about it, there is no way to turn the rice cooker off (you have to unplug it).I wouldn't buy this again.</review>

<review id="9979">I put this item in my cart on Feb. 15 and it cost no more than $49.99.  I searched for the item on Feb. 16 and found it for $39.99.  When I added it to my cart I received a message that the price of the version added yesterday increased from $49.99 to $59.99.  I exited from my cart and checked the product detail pages for both items and they were exactly the same.  I tried to search for this new $59.99 version but it didn't come up in results.  Amazon is CHEATING its customers.  It is penalizing them for strongly considering a product and it is constantly changing prices.  I've spent thousands of dollars at AMZN over the past 12 years.  I order EVERYTHING from them.

<review id="9980">I ordered this I-Touch for my son's Christmas present.  It arrived Christmas eve.  On Christmas Day, my son was elated.  It worked for a total of three hours, and then went dead, I mean dead.  Nothing we did could get it working again.  Needless to say, it ruined my son's Christmas.  I will say however that Amazon was very professional and timely about processing the return and issuing a refund.</review>

<review id="9981">Unlike previous models, the classic now requires an Apple cable and Universal Dock in order to play video. Previously all you needed was a standard AV out cable but they changed the software so it will just displays a "please connect video accessory" message when trying to play video.This really rains on my parade as I was previously satisfied with the product. Apple's pathetic effort to force the customer to add more complication and parts to use this basic functionality that previous models handled so well is very disappointing.</review>

<review id="9982">Foolishly, I did not read the reviews in Amazon before upgrading to 2009. Not only is the software even more unnecessarily complicated and confusing, it does not even work or provide any useful help. I finally upgraded from 2004, as the old software blocked any imports of QIF format files. I then upgraded to 2009, and it will not import any file format (QFX, QIF, OFX) from my financial institution. I have attempted to contact tech support via email multiple times, but they have not answered. I am ready to reverse the charges on my credit card as the sale of this product is fraud.</review>

<review id="9983">I have used this product for the last 3 years. I even got the audit protection. What a waste of time and money!!!Yes you'll get a real nice big tax return but when you get audited watch out! You'll be questioned on all sorts of technical terms that you won't know "Hey the ad just said I would be interviewed so I just entered the info"- WRONG ANSWER! The audit protection is a laugh. the so-called "Attorney" was always in a rush and asked you the same technical questions that you expect the software to take care of. Long story short after 3 years I got a $20,000 bill from the IRS and the "Attorney" that supposedly represented me said "I think they were very fair...you don't want to piss the auditor off then he'll really go after you". TRUE STORY. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND PAY A PROFESSIONAL YOU'LL BE GLAD IN THE LONG RUN!</review>

<review id="9985">One year warranty? Oh, THAT sure shows a lot of faith in the product by WD.   Everything else on the market is three to five years, theirs included. That's no guarantee of longevity, either. My WD My Book Pro II tanked in less than 18 months of a three year warranty. The entire My Book/Elements line has received a ton of poor reviews. The pro shops tell me the drives get too hot and fail early. So, I'd be skeptical of putting anything too critical on this drive, no matter how beefy it appears. To quote New Orleans musical icon Professor Longhair, "One year ain't no time."</review>

<review id="9987">This review is from: The Shack (Special Hardcover Edition) (Hardcover)      I couldn't finish it. I threw the book across the room at the scene where the Jesus character dropped the bowl of sauce on the floor whereupon the members of the Holy Trinity laughed uproariously and the Jesus character mopped the sauce off the feet of the "Father" character who said "ooooh, that feels so good."Terrible.

<review id="9988">Although Asus says they have 24/7 technical support - don't bother calling them on the weekend.I purchased this netbook for my 12 year old son on Dec 9 and gave it to him as A Christmas present. It is a nice little machine - it lasted about three weeks. Then one day last week it would not reboot.I spent a weekend on hold and getting cut-off from asus tech support. I was told twice I would get a call back and never got one. The people were rude - cut me off in mid-sentence, etc. They finally determined that it needs to be sent in to them. But they neglected to give me a case # - so when I called on Monday to get an RMA #, customer service put me on hold for another 45 minutes because I did not have a case #. Finally, I spoke with two competent people on Monday, after holding for a while and got the necessary information to send the broken PC to them (I have to pay the postage and insurance.)From research I have done on the internet, others have had this issue - the hard drive is toast.I did contact the amazon seller at some point - since I had the PC for just over a month. They could not help me because I did not keep the styrofoam that goes with the laptop (I did keep the box.)So incredibly disappointing based on all the positive reviews posted here.</review>

<review id="9989">Many of the scenes have very bad background picture quality (snowy is the best way to describe it). Big disappointment given that I was expecting picture quality to be awesome.</review>

<review id="9990">This controler is terrible for a number of reasons. I find it to be overpriced for the amount of quality that it has to offer. My friend bought me this controller some time ago and the d-pad broke after about a month. Compare this to one of the slim clear blue PC controllers that logitech sells for about $10. Those controllers lasted me about a year before breaking!Now, if you just need something to play emulators on, then I would suggest getting the smaller $10 logitech controllers. They are CHEAP and durable for the price that you can get them for. Great value! But if you're like me and want a controller to use for serious fighting games, then this is not the answer. The D-pad sticks too easily and eventually stops working. Avoid this controller because there are small, lighter, cheaper, more durable alternatives.</review>

<review id="9991">The Titanium Plus operates as a standard flash drive - no Launchpad user interface, no drive password, no hardware data encryption, if you select "No" to the initial prompt when you first connect the drive to a USB port.  If you select "Yes", the Launchpad interface will be installed.  You then have the Launchpad user interface, and the capability to password the drive.  But you will also be inundated with prompts to complete the registration for the on-line back-up service.  Once installed, you cannot disable the on-line back-up service in the setup/configuration for Launchpad, contrary to what the FAQ page on the Sandisk website for the Titanium Plus suggests.  The cost of the service after the 6 free months is not provided.  I would not trust personal data to an on-line Website anyway, even encrypted - look at the Microsoft ".Net Passport" fiasco, their database with people's personal information was hacked into multiple times.It appears Sandisk is attempting to force users into subscribing to the Sandisk on-line back-up service, unless you're willing to use the drive without any advanced features.  And what's to stop Sandisk from making all their older drives behave this way when you innocently submit to a software/firmware update?Time to switch to another USB drive brand.</review>

<review id="9992">I found that basic hair trimmers work better. The first tme I used this I cut myself.

<review id="9994">I bought an ASUS 900 last summer for a two month road trip in Europe, it actually performed pretty well.  When I returned home, it failed and would no longer boot.  Got a replacement which failed, exact same problem and its replacement failed as well, same problem.  I'm now waiting on the fourth PC.During this whole six week fiasco and working with ASUS customer support, I felt like I was talking to a bunch of high schoolers who had not developed their interpersonal skills yet, I was ignored, I encountered an uncaring attitude, I was promised things which didn't happen.  When I called, I couldn't get anyone to actually listen and I was transferred from one person to the next and sometimes the call was dropped.Any time one of their support people ran into a wall or encountered something they hadn't been trained for, they just gave up, they showed no initiative. Even though I asked and then demanded it, I was never allowed to speak to a supervisor for one reason or another.They should be ashamed of themselves.  I've searched on line and found gobs of complaints about their customer service; I wish I had done that before I purchased this item.  I've since bought a Sylvania g meso, it's awesome.  I like it even better than the ASUS model and it comes with Ubuntu linux.  Check it out.Maggie</review>

<review id="9995">This book was SO different from the other three. The other three had suspense, plot...this one did not. Everything that would be expected to happen HAPPENED. Has epic-ness completely left the universe? No, because J. K. Rowling still knows how to craft a series and end it equally as well. Stephenie, I love you, but this book wasn't good. The writing was perfect, but the story was terrible. It seemed like a terrible fan-fic gone completely RIGHT. Pregnancy, sex, marriage, Bella-vamp...mostly without a hitch. The only thing I AM happy about (which is surprising, because I HATED Jake in the previous books), is that Jake got a happy ending. How ironic is it that it was Bella's baby? But that's okay.What was NOT okay was the ending. The Merchant of Venice was a clue? No fight? Nothing? All that training, Bella becoming a vampire, and NO climax? Nothing? Why? Supposedly, Stephenie says the Volturi would have won. Hm. Last I checked she was the author, and if Bella has these powers, she can certainly use them.It took me a while to write this review, mostly because I had to let it settle in that a). The series is over and b). it ended in a terrible way; I had to cool off and discuss it with my Twilighter friends. But it just felt...so different, so foreign. The other three books were so compelling...that's why they had the power to knock Potter off his broomstick for a while.Ultimately, I think she had success with the first three, which reeled us all in. Moreover, I think she will have a LOT of success with any future novels she decides to write (and, as stated on her website, she's trying to focus on a project right now. Can't wait until it's announced!).Basically, she's still my favorite author (barely), and she should be thankful that she has devoted fans, because after this train wreck, she better come out with a book that's doubly amazing.</review>

<review id="9996">This is not a good book.  I get the instinct for fans to rationalize the quality of a book, I really do.  And truthfully, the style of writing in here is the same evocative, engaging style that characterized the other books in the series - that hasn't changed.  What has changed is the apparent willingness of Meyer's agent, editors and draft readers to contradict their golden goose when she proposes a plot and structure that should have sent warning flags up all over the place from the very first draft.The story structure is bad, people.  The midpoint of the novel feels like an end, and the second half of the novel builds builds builds builds... into a total collapse.  Basic storytelling, you don't devote tons of energy and time to setting up a conflict and then have it dissolve away.  I'd also say that after three books where your critics and fans increasingly mention that your heroine's losing her spark and becoming disturbingly passive, you shouldn't write one where she is LITERALLY incapacitated for half the book.  When your hero's been criticized for being an overreacting drama queen, you might want to mature him to a point where he stops hyperventilating and treating the heroine like a spun glass creation that can't make her own decisions.  And lastly, when you've already experienced the not-unnoticed uproar over Quil and his toddler bride, don't freaking replicate that!  When you're already bending the rules of vampire lore (to the point of breaking for many), you can flex the less-defined shapeshifter rules a bit as well to accommodate your audience's horrified reaction to the test-run of that particular relationship.I think Meyer got bored (understandably) of Bella and Edward.  They turned into cardboard cutouts - the only time the story came to life was when Jacob's POV was happening, and that's because he had a new story to tell (I suspect someone should have told Meyer to scrap this entire thing and instead write an overlapping Jacob story that also covered this territory). There are too many instances where an editor should have written "HELL NO" in the margins of the manuscript.  I'll cede the realism of not having anyone we like die in the series - I disagree with it, in the same way that you add salt to sweet recipes to heighten the contrast and make the sweet more vibrant - but fine, no one dies. Fairy tales are great, and I take the point that they end up happily ever after, but not for everyone in the tale!  The wicked witch dies, the stepsisters get their comeuppance, the dragon is slain.  In "Breaking Dawn", the good get their happy ending, but the evil isn't vanquished.  It just mutters something sinister, decides not to kill anyone today and slinks offstage.  That's not a fairy tale ending, that's alarming.Meyer isn't a bad writer, she's a good one.  "Twilight" was compelling, "The Host" similarly engaging.  It's her sequels that turn into small-scale disasters - well, that and the trend of female characters who start off strong and then spend the story withering into a person that needs protection.The lesson here, for me, is that JK Rowling and her editors were miles more talented than I gave them credit for in their ability to walk the tightrope of audience reaction and author ownership.  And Meyer's people should start taking notes on how to manage this sort of expectation, because "Breaking Dawn" is surely going to damage her base for her next release.</review>

<review id="9997">I made the mistake of not reading about this product prior to purchase. I've had the software for 2 weeks now, and am at the point of not caring about whether or not my computer is virus-protected. My review boils down to these facts:1) One Care 2.0 is an extreme resource hog, and slows down your computer's performance significantly upon bootup and overall useage.2) It constantly warns you of being at risk for not having the latest Windows updates, so expect 10 - 15 minutes spent every other day to download the latest updates and restarting your computer.3) It corrupts music CD burning and must be shut off during that process or else your music CDs will have mute spots.Is this enough for you to avoid the purchase? I hope so.Stick with AVG or Trend Micro. Both are excellent products and do not weigh down your system's resources, interrupt simple tasks, constantly annoy you to download Windows updates, and will let you be at PEACE.</review>

<review id="9998">Spoiler free reviewI have read books 1,2,3 of the Twilight Saga and loved them all. When I read Breaking Dawn, I tried really hard to make myself to like it (really I did!), but wasn't able to. I found that the story lacked of the nice writing style it had in the first three books, I didn't find the plot lines very original (they seemed like fanfiction) and above all I felt like the characters where totally lost, since they said things and acted very differently from what they were like in Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse. Also I would like to point out to younger readers that might be uncomfortable with reading about sex, that this book is a bit more sexual than the first three. I personally felt very disappointed (sorry Stephenie) and wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless you really want to finish reading the whole Saga.I hope this review helps you!</review>

<review id="9999">I would not recommend this teakettle because the plastic lid seemed to off-gas a noxious smell and taste when boiling water.  The off-gassing only started to dissipate after many boilings.  I followed the instructions and boiled and emptied the kettle once before using, but my family and I noticed a distinctly unpleasant taste in our tea which coincided with the chemical smell emanating from the kettle as it boiled the water.  It was also quite noisy.</review>
